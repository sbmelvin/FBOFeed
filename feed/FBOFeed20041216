<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of Public Health and Emergency Preparedness (OASPHEP) through the Program Support Center (PSC), intends to award, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2, a sole source contract to the American Burn Association (ABA), 625 N. Michigan Ave., Ste 1530, Chicago, Illinois 60611 to provide Advanced Burn Life Support (ABLS) and Clinical Training.  The DHHS has undertaken a mission to comply with the requirements of the Office of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-10 (OHSPD-10) and the Federal Response Plan (FRP) to provide for and coordinate healthcare responses during an emergency and to better prepare and respond to emergency situations caused by terrorism, natural disasters, or catastrophic accidents.  As part of this endeavor, HHS has investigated the need for trained burn nurses to provide surge capability and capacity for the nation during such times.  The goal of this project is to train approximately 200 nurses (nationwide) in Advanced Burn Life Support (ABLS).  Under this contract, the ABA will provide ABLS and Clinical Training which includes one day of ABLS training, one day of specific burn protocol training, and one week of on-site burn training for 50 (initial) participants.  An additional 150 participants may be trained in the future.  Additionally, ABA will provide course materials and testing, and arrange for on-site burn training for each nurse at an approved ABA Burn Center near the participants duty station.  The ABA is the only known, nationally recognized source for Advanced Burn Life Support and Clinical Training of this type.  The ABA, has over the years developed national guidelines to optimize burn care and created the program to provide an operational assessment of individual burn centers, and to verify that they comply with the national standards.  In addition, the ABA established a National Burn Repository and burn registry software known as National TRACS Burnware.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above. Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as described above by December 22, 2004.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available at this time.  For further information, contact Paula Conner in Room 5C-13, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857 or on 301-443-2475.

<DESC>UNITED STATES TREASURY DEPARTMENT
GOVERNMENT DEBT ISSUANCE AND MANAGEMENT ADVISORS.    


The U.S. Treasury Department provides technical assistance and policy advice to senior government and central bank officials and market participants in nearly 30 countries. We are recruiting candidates for positions as resident (long-term) and intermittent (short term) advisors in government debt issuance and management in countries throughout the world, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Southeast and Central Asia, Latin America, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. This recruitment is for global assignments and significant international travel is required.

For resident (long-term) assignments, we seek experts in domestic government securities issuance and management. Experience in international bond markets is highly desirable. Applicants for resident assignments ideally should have a combination of public and private sector experience in government debt management, investment banking or financial advisory work. For intermittent (short term) assignments, we are seeking advisors with particular expertise in: liability management policy and procedures; legal framework for government securities; market regulation; custody, clearing and settlement; fixed income trading; treasury operations; and mortgage and other asset-backed finance. For all positions, management experience is desired. Prior overseas work experience in challenging environments is a distinct advantage. Foreign language skills are highly desirable. While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of host government officials and provide sound but realistic advice to a sovereign government in an emerging market environment will determine ultimate success.   Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.

SALARY AND BENEFITS: Salaries are negotiated in accordance with program regulations, based on demonstrated salary history and the skills required. The salary range is from $85,000 to $145,600, subject to January 1, 2005, cost of living adjustments.   Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations.  Successful applicants will be subject to a background investigation at the appropriate level.   This announcement is open and continuous until June 30, 2005 although selections maybe made in advance of that date.   Applicants should submit a cover letter, resume or OF-612 by e-mail to: tgray@ota.treas.gov or by mail to:  U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Technical Assistance, ATTN: Recruitment Coordinator, 740 15th Street, N. W. – 4th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20220.  Please reference Solicitation Number A05-012 on your cover letter, resume or OF-612.  Only applicants to be interviewed will be contacted.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), intends to award a sole source change order under General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule No. 35F-0444K to Savantage Financial Services, Inc. in the estimated amount of $10 million to ensure continuity of Federal Financial Management Services (FFMS) services provided at ICE.

The current Schedule GS-35F-0444K task order was initially awarded on a sole source basis to Savantage Financial Services in January 31, 2002 to provide Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) support for legacy-Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).  It was awarded as a Time and Materials (T&M) task order for  a base period of 12 months plus four one-year options. The Schedule order was awarded to obtain all technical and management support services required to design, develop, install, operate and maintain the FFMS system at legacy INS service-wide.

On March 1, 2003, the enforcement mission of legacy-INS transitioned to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  FFMS was chosen as the financial software to support ICE and other DHS components including US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), DHS Departmental Operations (OPS), Border and Transportation Security (BTS), Science and Technology (S&T), and Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP). The anticipated change order is necessary due to ICE’s transition to DHS and its requirement to support five other DHS organizational elements.

Savantage software is proprietary and already installed and implemented nationwide and supporting over 25,000 employees.  Interfaces to FFMS include an automated Procurement System (PRISM), NFC Payroll, Gelco Travel Manager, and the Debt Collection System.  Only Savantage Financial Services, Inc., as the developer and sole producer of the FFMS software, has knowledge of the design needed to ensure continued operation of this highly specialized and customized financial software system.  Savantage is the only vendor in the market which possesses the in-depth knowledge of the legacy INS/DHS’s financial and accounting system and legacy financial system relationships required to ensure continued success of the FFMS in a cost effective and timely manner.

In November 2004, DHS awarded Bearing Point a contract to implement Oracle Financials during FY05/FY06, for its Bureaus, as part of its eMerge2 (Electronically Managing Enterprise Resources for Government Effectiveness and Efficiency) initiative.  All DHS Bureaus must transition from their existing financial software to the awarded software under eMerge2 during FY05/FY06.  ICE is scheduled to transition during late FY05 and its servicing components during mid FY05. The subject change order will serve as a bridge to ensure continuity of services until ICE commences full performance with EMERGE2 solution.

All inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer, Joseph Spencer, by e-mail at joseph.spencer@dhs.gov, or by phone at 202-514-0587.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a sole source requirement for the production of clinical-grade adenoviral vector vaccines expressing modified Ebola gene products.  Materials produced will be used to conduct clinical trials regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Crucell Holland BV of Leiden, Netherlands has been identified as the only responsible source for this procurement.  Crucell is the source of a proprietary packaging cell line (Per.C6) that has a demonstrated safety profile in the production adenoviral vectors for use in human clinical trials.  In addition, product produced under the current NIAID contract by Crucell will be used in a Phase I clinical trial in 2005.  Assuming a successful Phase I clinical trial, NIAID will require the production of additional material for Phase II trials.  Regulatory requirements dictate that the material for Phase II trials be produced in the same cell line as used for the Phase I studies, or else the Phase I trial must be repeated.  Switching to another manufacturer and ultimately another cell line would require a repeat of the Phase I trial at a significant and unnecessary duplicative cost to the government.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement for evaluation.  Any questions or capability statements should be forwarded to Terrie Nestor, tnestor@niaid.nih.gov, by 2:00pm on January 31, 2005.  See Note 22.

The annual license renewal is required to continue receiving regular updates as new versions of the software are released; access to technical support; prompt notification of buys, and new documentation is published.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 30, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>Procurement Salt Cedar Extraction - Fire Prevention, NAICS 115310  -- The National Park Service (NPS) plans to issue a service contract for salt cedar control by mechanically extrication (excavator with special bucket) and pile/windrow over a minimum of approximately 220 acres of federal land.  This will occur at two locations within Lake Meredith NRA for the purpose of improving riparian vegetation conditions and potentially increasing available ground and surface water quantity and quality.  The extraction equipment will remove the tap root system of the salt cedars and pile and windrow the salt cedars in all project units.  The project area includes the Plum Creek Boat Ramp area and Lake Meredith Habor Boat Ramp.  Project areas may be comprised of light, medium and heavy density stands of salt cedar, with factors such as terrain, soils, and placement of extricated salt cedar, affecting the amount of time needed to complete each project site. Each project site is within the flood plains of the lake or river bottom that have been previously disturbed.  The extricated salt cedar will be piled or windrowed on site in areas specified by NPS fire personnel for future burning.  It is expected that 80 percent of the trees removed will not resprout.  The other 20% may resprout from lateral broken roots and, in that event, they will be chemically treated by NPS at a later date. Raking will not be required.  In some areas, other target species may be included, such as elm or Russian olive, if they are found intermingled with salt cedar.  Non-target species will be left, such as mesquite and cottonwoods.  Some grass species will be sacrificed if growing in the understory of the salt cedar.  Access to the sites will be arranged by Lake Meredith personnel and shall be subject to weather conditions.  All project areas are accessible by roads and no road construction will be needed.  The contractor at its expense and upon request by LAMR would clean the equipment and deliver it to the first work site free of noxious weed seeds. Should it be determined by LAMR that equipment cleaning is necessary between work areas, cleaning costs would be added to LAMR's costs.  The proposed contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which will be considered by the NPS.  Quotation submittals will be evaluated on low cost technically acceptable, FAR part 15.101-2 applies.  The award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.  Price: Non-price evaluation factors are more important then price.  Significant non-price evaluation factor is possession of the machinery necessary to do the task.

<CONTACT>Dean Hayes, Contract Specialist, Phone 813-828-6038, Fax 813-828-7504, Email hayesd@socom.mil
<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Headquarters Procurement Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with FLIR Systems, Inc.,  (FSI), Boston, 16 Esquire Road, North Billerica, MA 01862, for Repair Services to the Maritime Forward Looking Infrared (MARFLIR) for a five year period, in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The basis for the sole source is that obtaining other than FSI's services for repair of the MARFLIR is not possible due to a lack of rights in technical data.  As background information, in 2000, the Government competitively awarded contract N00164-00-D-0026 to FSI for MARFLIR.  With this competitive selection, MARFLIRs were fielded and installed on NSW MKV craft.  As it was a commercial contract, technical data rights (other than Government Purpose Rights) were not obtained.  The Government does not have any mechanical and electrical drawings, information on internal software and interface control documents to provide to another company.  In addition the MARFLIR is unique to other available FLIRs, and so repair services for other FLIRs differ from what is required for the MARFLIR.  Based on this the repair services for the MARFLIR must be obtained from FSI.  Responses to this synopsis must be submitted within 30 days of the date of this announcement.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command intends to award a sole source contract to The Boeing Company for design and production of forty (40) Reconfigurable Transportable Consolidated Automated Support System High Power (RTCASS HP) modules.  The contract will contain a base year for design work and four (4) options for production.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  The RTCASS HP module is an extremely complex system that must be integrated with RTCASS.  The RTCASS Technical Data Package will not be complete until November 2005.  RTCASS HP must achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) by March, 2008.  In order to meet this schedule, design of RTCASS HP must begin prior to delivery of the TDP.  As the sole designer of RTCASS, Boeing is the only firm with the technical knowledge to perform the necessary design without a TDP.  When the solicitation becomes available, it will be posted on the NAVAIR webpage, which may be accessed at the following URL: http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/

The Vsoft CHEX Remittance Image system Software is the original COTS product, which has since been significantly customized by VSoft to meet the needs of SSA. VSoft is the only firm known capable of performing the software maintenance work being sought, because of their inherent knowledge of the customized software.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>A--Broad Agency Announcement to Support Minefield Neutralization for Assured Mobility (MNAM)Program
<SOLNBR>W909MY05R0006
<RESPDATE>020105
<ARCHDATE>04022005
<CONTACT>Peggy Melanson, 703-325-6096
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W909MY-04-R-0006, soliciting white papers for applied research in minefield breaching, has been posted on the Single Face to Industry website, https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  Following is an extraction from the BAA. Offerors are directed to access the website for the official BAA.  Research Opportunity Description:  In support of the FY05-FY08 applied research program, Minefield Neutralization for Assured Mobility (MNAM), herein referred to as the MNAM program, the Ni ght Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, Neutralization Branch is soliciting white papers specifically for research in minefield breaching  technologies compatible with and deliverable by a ground-based Unit of Employmen t (UE) platform delivery mechanism that can achieve a minimum 2.5km standoff up to 30km standoff or more from the launching platform to the minefield, herein referred to as the delivery platform.   Awards under this BAA will be supported by Advanced Techno logy Development (Budget Category 6.3) funds.  Priority will be given to concepts applicable to U.S. Army minefield breaching and exhibiting strong evidence of being field demonstrable within 18 months.  NVESD manages a variety of tech base programs in sup port of the Armys countermine detection and neutralization programs.  The overall goal of this solicitation is to leverage existing neutralization capabilities compatible with a developmental rocket system to achieve advances in countermine science and te chnology, which may lead to future operational minefield breaching capabilities as outlined herein.  Currently fielded and developmental Army minefield breaching systems must be towed into close proximity to the minefield (approximately 50-60m) to be deplo yed.  These systems also have fixed dimensions (width and length) that limit variation in the size and shape of the cleared area.  The MNAM program is a neutralization technology demonstration intended to improve the options for maneuver support to a highl y mobile force; therefore, rate-of-advance (OP-TEMPO) and maximal standoff capability is important. The Army's Future Combat System (FCS) family-of-vehicles (Unit of Action) is the maneuver force to be supported.  The UA, while still a significant distance  away from the minefield, should be able to call for on-demand delivery from the UE to achieve standoff neutralization of cleared lanes through a series of successive minefield belts or mined obstacle zones and maintain an average 50 km/h OPTEMPO from the point of making the call at least to the point of entering the cleared lanes produced.  Lower speed within the cleared lanes may be necessary depending on the terrain, any proofing and marking to be conducted, or other factors.  Trade studies resulting fro m this solicitation will be required to address the AT landmine neutralization time and rate-of-advance implications of the proposed neutralization method.  No specific scenario is required, but Offerors are invited to address these ROA issues in white pap ers as they are affected by the proposed neutralization method.  The MNAM program will evaluate alternative neutralization concepts at the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) level 4 or higher, that are compatible with the delivery platform to accomplish brea ching from long standoff distances and define the potential for selectable variation in the width and length of the cleared lane areas produced, by using a delivery means that allows for programming the number of neutralizer munition payloads delivered and  their delivery points.   The MNAM programs focus is on demonstrating a highly effective minefield neutralizer capability to defeat antitank (AT) landmines from long standoff distance of 2.5 km to 30 km and through soil overburdens of 0 cm to 13 cm when l aunched from the delivery platform and delivered to the minefield cleared lane target area.  Mines will be considered neutralized only with complete consumption  and/or expulsion of all explosives within the mine and resulting destruction of the mine's ability to function as a mine (though any expelled residues, components or fragments may remain dangerous to handle). Sample threats to be neutralized are anti-tank /vehicular (AT) landmines equal to or larger than a VS 1.6 mine (minimum 220mm diameter or width) within the designated target area as a minimum, but may include other mine targets of equal or greater size, including anti-landing (AL) mines, side-attack/of f-route mines (ORMs), wide-area mines (WAMs) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), if these can be effectively destroyed in addition to the broad range of more conventional AT mines.  AT mines may employ a variety of fuze types, including contact (e.g. pressure, tilt rod), and non-contact (magnetic influence, seismic/acoustic and other sensors).  The selection of White Papers and subsequent contract(s) for award will be based on a scientific and engineering peer review evaluation of proposals (including options). The business and contractual aspects, including cost, will also be considered as a part of the evaluation.  The specific basis for award and evaluation criteria are set forth in the official BAA.  This document is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA ) sponsored by the U. S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) NVESD, Ft. Belvoir, VA.  This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) and  paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  Accordingly, proposals selected for award are considered to be the res ult of full and open competition and fully compliant with PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  Award(s) against this BAA can be made for two years after receipt of proposals and notification of selectability. Specific costs and terms and  conditions will be negotiated prior to award. The Government contemplates the awarding of Cost Reimbursement (Cost, CPFF) type contract(s); however, proposals based on other contract types will be considered. The Government reserves the right to select fo r award all, some, or none of the proposals received. The maximum length of an award will be four years. There is no a priori judgment regarding the number or size of individual awards or the allocation of total research and development funds across the te chnology solutions listed above.   Prospective offerors should note that this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement.  The cost of proposal preparation for respons e to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Potential offerors are reminded that  only a duly warranted contracting officer may obligate the Government to an agreement involving the expenditure of Government funds.  In order for any proposals to be considered, the proposed effort MUST meet the definition of applied research and develop ment found at FAR 35.001.  Submission of White Papers is mandatory prior to submission of a full proposal.  Submission of full proposals will be by specific invitation in response to successful white papers.  The selection of one or more proposals for awar d will be based on a peer and scientific evaluation of each offeror's response (to include both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.  There will be no formal request for proposal or an y further solicitation document issued in regard to this BAA.  Therefore, interested parties should be alert for any amendme nts to this BAA that may be published on the website.  This BAA will be open until 1 February 2005.  Funds beyond the current fiscal year, are not presently available for this BAA; however, funds are planned in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) for this  research.  No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment for the effort being acquired.   Prior to White Paper submission, potential offerors are encouraged to contact the technical point of contact Mr. Noel Wright who will direct the offerors to the appropriate subject matter experts as required.  However, after White Paper submission, all que stions and discussions must be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>As a result of questions asked from an offeror, this requirement is amended to provide the following clarifications and amend the statement of work (SOW): 

Clarification 1:

1.  General Requirements—Section 1

Please provide clarification on the last sentence of the paragraph, which states, “during the performance of the contract will be required to purchase and install miscellaneous alarm and surveillance equipment.”  During the course of the contract, what will ADT be required to purchase and install?  How much of this equipment will be needed to be installed?  Is this equipment different from the list provided?

The requirement to purchase the miscellaneous alarm and surveillance equipment under Section 11 of the SOW is deleted.  The contractor is not required to purchase these items as originally requested. 

Clarification 2:

2.  Maintenance Support—Section 3

b.1 Remote Support

Please provide clarification on the last sentence, which states “remote diagnostic capability in order to perform minor troubleshooting and /or software repairs.”  Is remote support considered to be a help desk that Government personnel can call to obtain technical support, or is there equipment on site that ADT will have to “dial into”?  Based on the information obtained in section 10, Security System Composition, the only equipment capable of being dialed into is the Casi-Rusco Secure Perfect system.  Will there be GFE connection equipment?  Will there be a connection via modem or IP address?

Remote diagnostic means capable of dialing in.  We have a Casi-Rusco system in place now and connection can be established via IP address.
Clarification 3:

3.  b.3  Preventive Maintenance

Please provide clarification as to how many preventative maintenance calls will be obligatory per year.

At least 2 preventive maintenance calls are required for the year.

Clarification 4:

4.  Technical Support—Section A-I

Please clarify whether tasks listed are to be performed exclusively as part of the pre-determined number of preventative maintenance calls listed above.  For instance, if the Government requests that a technician visit the site to perform a back up of all files, outside of a preventative maintenance call, should this be billed as a time and material service call?

If the Government requests any tasks outside the scope of work, a modification will be issued adding the task to the contract. 

Clarification 5:

5.  Response Time—Section 5

Please clarify the required response time for having a technician on site if ADT Technical Assistance cannot resolve the issue remotely nor over the phone.  Does this response include the time it takes to get onto the facility grounds?

Revised the sentence to read as:  Accordingly, the Government established a requirement that from the time the Government notifies the Contractor that a system problem exists, the Contractor shall respond within that a two (2) hours and a four (4) hour on-site response time if required.

Clarification 6:

6.  Upgrades—Section 6

In the event that the existing Government computer on site cannot support a software upgrade, is the contractor responsible for supplying a new (upgraded) computer?  

Yes, the contractor is required to provide their computer equipment (turnkey).  

Clarification 7:

7.  Security System Composition—Section 10

In section 10, Security System Composition, please clarify the statement “items are not exclusive.”  
Also in this section, there is mention of the secure terminal interface.  Are these STI’s  connected to alarm equipment?  If so, is there additional alarm equipment other than what was installed by the original contractor?

“Items are not exclusive” means that all on-site equipment may not be listed.  
The STI’s are not connected to an alarm.  No additional equipment has been installed other than that of the original contractor.

Clarification 8:

8.  Miscellaneous Alarm and Signal Equipment—Section 11

Please clarify the intent of the list provided.  Will this list and the section 10 list be considered as separate and different?

The requirement to purchase the miscellaneous alarm and surveillance equipment under Section 11 of the SOW is deleted.  The contractor is not required to purchase these items as originally requested.

<DESC>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) invites proposals for basic research in support of the Air Force Defense Research Sciences Program. This program is described in the document entitled Research Interests and Broad Agency Announcement 2005-1. This document will guide proposers through AFOSR's research program and facilitate their preparation of research proposals. It is available on the AFOSR web site at http://www.afosr.af.mil/. A very limited number of hard copies will be available for individuals without access to the AFOSR web site. To request a hard copy, contact AFOSR/PKC at pkcontracting@afosr.af.mil. The general areas of interest are: (1) Aerospace and Materials Sciences; e.g., structural mechanics; mechanics of materials and devices; unsteady aerodynamics and hypersonics; turbulence and rotating flows; combustion and diagnostics; space power and propulsion; metallic materials; combustion and diagnostics; space power and propulsion; metallic materials; ceramics and nonmetallic materials; organic matrix composites. (2) Physics and Electronics; e.g., electroenergetic physics; space electronics; atomic and molecular physics; remote sensing and imaging; optoelectronics: components and information processing; laser and optical physics; quantum electronic solids; semiconductor materials; sensors in the space environment; high density optical memory. (3) Chemistry and Life Sciences; e.g., polymer chemistry; surface and interfacial science; theoretical chemistry; molecular dynamics; chronobiology; biomimetics, biomaterials, and biointerfacial sciences; cognition and decision; sensory systems; biological response profiling and assessment.

Our overriding purpose in supporting this research is to advance the state-of-the-art in areas related to the technical problems the Air Force encounters in developing and maintaining a superior Air Force; in lowering the cost and improving the performance, maintainability, and supportability of Air Force weapon systems; and in creating and preventing technological surprise. AFOSR will seek technical options that may address our need for heightened attention to homeland defense, funding those good ideas that are relevant to the AF role, and assisting in getting other good ideas to the agencies that may find them of special relevance to their role. All pertinent information, including contact persons, evaluation criteria, and details on specific areas of interest, is discussed in the AFOSR pamphlet entitled "Research Interests and Broad Agency Announcement 2005-1". Before sending a proposal, inquire if someone at AFOSR is interested in your field of work. That person can also provide guidance for preparing a proposal before you begin to develop the proposal. Additional information and guidance on format and proposal submittal may be found in AFOSR Pamphlet, "Proposer's Guide to AFOSR's Research Programs". This pamphlet is also available on the AFOSR web site. See Numbered Note 26

<CONTACT>Carolyn Haynes, 907/753-2545
<DESC>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR SOLICITATION.  The Alaska District Corps of Engineers intends to award a proprietary and/or sole source modification for a Honeywell fire alarm panel under contract DACA85-02-C-0004, Bassett Army Commun ity Hospital Replacement, Fort Wainwright, Alaska (FTW171B).  The panel will serve as an interface between the Siemens fire alarm panel installed in the new Bassett Hospital and the Ft. Wainwright post-wide Honeywell fire alarm system and will enable trans mission of trouble, alarm and supervisory signals.  The Ft. Wainwright existing central fire reporting system remotely monitors fire alarm systems throughout the post.  The post system is manufactured by Honeywell and utilizes a Honeywell W7053 computerize d panel as the supervising station control unit.  The Honeywell W7053 uses proprietary language to communicate with building fire alarm panels throughout the post and that language is only compatible with particular models of Honeywell fire alarm panels. The new Bassett Hospital has a Siemens Pyrotronics MXL fire alarm panel that cannot communicate with the post-wide Honeywell system.  Therefore, a Honeywell building fire alarm panel (Honeywell FS90Plus) is required to act as an interface between the Sieme ns building fire alarm panel and the existing Honeywell central fire reporting system.  Dry alarm, supervisory, and trouble contacts in the Siemens panel will connect to the Honeywell interface panel which, in turn, will report the state of the contacts to  the Ft. Wainwright central reporting system.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement in the form of a letter and standard marketing material describing how the equipment is comparable to the Honeywell FS90Plus fire alarm panel.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS; however all submittals received within 45 calendar days of the date of this publication will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government to not comp ete this equipment requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to compete the requirement.

<ARCHDATE>12162005
<CONTACT>Bruce Blackistone Space Management Program Manag 2023541939     Bruce_Blackistone@nps.gov;
<DESC>Secretary of Interior National Park Service Grand Canyon National Park REQUEST FOR INFORMATION N0026050001  This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a Solicitation for Offers (SFO), and is NOT a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Response to the RFI will NOT serve as a proposal, bid, or offer, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.   The National Park Service (NPS) is currently examining partnering alternatives for housing under the authorities granted in its Administrative Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-333, U.S.C. (pg) 17o, dated November 12, 1996).  The NPS is interested in gaining further information through market research from providers with relevant and sustained experience in the housing industry.  The objective of this RFI is to obtain technical capability profiles tailored to the requirements outlined below as well as answers to a series of questions regarding the provider capability to furnish the services as described. Grand Canyon National Park (GRCA) has a requirement for high-quality energy star compliant housing located on GRCA.  The provider will secure debt and/or contributed equity as needed to accomplish the following: (1) design, finance, and construct 60 units, and (2) operate, manage, and maintain the units, including certain streets and selected infrastructure, and ancillary facilities.   Includes performance of all maintenance and capital renewal to ensure the units remain in high-quality condition during lease period regardless of location.     The housing requirements are:   # of Units	# of Bedrooms	Square Footage (Approximately) 32	1	500 28	2	1,060 The GRCA potential housing site is both level and vacant, and on-park.  The site is located approximately a quarter mile west of the intersection of Albright Avenue and Center Avenue in South Rim Village.  The hatched area on the referenced map indicates the disturbed area at the former Yak Camp where the potential site is located.   There are trees and buildings throughout the potential site.   Potential bidders will be responsible for the demolition of existing buildings on the new construction site, however there are no restrictions on the removal of the vegetation in the area.   The NPS currently expects the site size to be approximately 7 acres.  The park location requires the partner to install, connect and maintain all the utilities and streets to the Albright Road intersection.  Also, the developer must install landscaping consistent with the local environment.  The map may be viewed at:  http://www.nps.gov/grca/procurement/yakk.pdf  .  Note: Adobe Acrobat Reader, version 5 or newer, is required to view this site. GRCA would rent the site to the provider, for twenty five to fifty years (depending upon financing and options), for a nominal fee.  The park location will be used for NPS housing needs, and all housing must meet NPS quality standards and blend in with the park environment.     The total rental charges for NPS personnel are prescribed by OMB Circular A-45 and adjusted annually ( http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a045/a045.html ).  While rental rates typically increase, they may also decrease.  The monthly rental rates for FY05 are: (1) 1 bedroom unit - $230 and (2) 2 bedroom unit - $456.  Utility costs are borne by the occupant and paid separately.      The NPS anticipates a base lease period of 25-30 years, followed by a series of options ranging from 5 to10 years.  The total duration of the project will not exceed 50 years.  Any property built on GRCA will revert to the government at end of lease period.  Off-park property shall remain within the possession or control of the provider. Technical Capability Profiles: 1.	Company qualifications (years in business, independent financial statements, number of rental units managed, geographical location(s) of business operations) 2.	Experience in developing and managing housing, particularly under similar programs (federal/state/local). Questions:  1.	What could you do to help NPS reduce both construction and operations/management costs? 2.	What is your estimate, if any, of a required NPS financial contribution (upfront and/or recurring) to the project beyond rent revenue stream?  Park?  Off-park? 3.	What approach would you employ to meet all maintenance and capital renewal needs?  Specify how funds would be set aside to cover these expenses. 4.	What approach would you employ to ensure that on-site development conforms to the park environment and needs? 5.	How do you envision the long-term business relationship between the NPS and your company would work? 6.	What are the pros and cons for locating the development in park?  Off-park? 7.	What other steps could the NPS take to improve the long-term success of this project? Questions or inquiries from potential bidders can be addressed Bruce Blackistone, Program Manager, NPS Space Management Program at 202-354-1939 or via email at bruce_blackistone@nps.gov.

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information (RFI)On Antenna Radomes For Application Across Multiple Band Combinations.  Solicitation Number for reference purposes is:  W9128Z-05-RFI-0001 And Parabolic Antenna Sizes RADOME
<DESC>1.  Background.  The U.S. Army Information Systems Engineering Command (USAISEC) provides satellite communications engineering support services to a variety of Department of Defense (DoD) customers.  The satellite communications systems supported inc lude single-band systems that operate in the C-, X-, Ku-, and Ka-bands, and multi-band systems including combinations of C/X/Ku and X/Ka bands.  Since environmental and security concerns sometimes necessitate the use of a radome to protect or conceal an an tenna system, USAISEC needs to be prepared to make recommendations concerning radome application. 2.  Purpose. The purpose of this RFI is to gather performance, rough order of magnitude (ROM) lifecycle cost, and product availability information from radome vendors on the products and services they can provide to cover a variety of applications.  This d ata may ultimately be used to make recommendations for potential radome acquisitions. 3.  Required Data. 3.1. Frequency Bands.  Frequency bands of interest for this request include C (3 - 6 GHz range), X (7.25  8.4 GHz range), Ku (10 - 14 GHz range), and Ka (20-21 / 30-31 GHz range) bands. 3.2. Electrical performance.  Electrical performance data should include, at a minimum, insertion and scattering loss, insertion phase delay, and noise figure in all bands listed above, and passive intermodulation product (PIM) performance at X-band.  Cert ain applications require X-band PIM performance below -190 dBm when radiated with two balanced carriers at a total power of 13 mW/cm2, therefore, include data for low-PIM and standard-PIM performance. 3.3  Environmental performance.  Environmental performance data should include, at a minimum, maximum and minimum operating winds and temperatures. 3.4. Maintenance and support.  Maintenance and support data should include, but is not limited to, data on reoccurring maintenance and recommended preventive maintenance schedule and tasks (e.g. inspection, painting, repair, etc.) and expected lifespan of the radome under normal operating conditions. 3.5. Cost of Ownership.  Provide a rough order of magnitude cost estimate for both non-recurring costs (e.g. purchase, shipping, installation, etc.), and monthly recurring costs (e.g. electrical load, radome maintenance, etc.).  Break out installation cost s by heavy equipment and manpower required. 3.6.  Radome Size.  The size of the radome should only be as large as necessary to accommodate the antenna size specified. 4.  Specific Applications.  Provide the data specified above for standard and/or custom products to support the following applications: 4.1. C-band, 16-meter, full motion, parabolic antenna with maximum height of 18.3 meters. 4.2. X-band, 11.5-meter, full motion, parabolic antenna with maximum height of 14.6 meters, standard-PIM, and low-PIM performance. 4.3. X-band, 18.3-meter, full motion, parabolic antenna with maximum height of 28 meters, standard-PIM, and low-PIM performance.  Note, for this application only, the radome would be installed on top of a 3-meter high base. 4.4. Ku-band, 9-meter, full motion, parabolic antenna with maximum height of 9.6 meters. 4.5. Ka-band, 9-meter, full motion, parabolic antenna with maximum height of 9.6 meters. 4.6. Tri-band (C/X/Ku), 9-meter, full motion, parabolic antenna, standard-PIM, and low-PIM performance. 4.7. Tri-band (C/X/Ku), 16-meter, full motion, parabolic antenna with maximum height of 18.3 meters, standard-PIM, and low-PIM performance. 4.8. Dual-band (X/Ka), 11.5-meter, full motion, parabolic antenna with maximum height of 14.6 meters, low-PIM. 4.9. Quad-band (C/X/Ku/Ka), 16-meter, full motion, parabolic antenna with maximum height of 18.3 meters, standard-PIM, and low-PIM performance. 5.  If more information or clarification is required, the point of contact for this request is Mr. David Lease, at 520-538-3026.  Request data be provided by 8 January 2005. 6.   This is not a r equest for proposal.  There are no drawings or specifications outside of that described above.  Offerors shall provide their business classification status (i.e. large business, small business, 8(a), etc) and availability of equipment in their response.  I nformation providers shall address paragraphs 1 through 5 of the RFI in sufficient detail to all the government to make a determination as to what is available on the market without having to conduct further market surveys.

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, MD requires the contractor to conduct a Long-term Career Outcomes Study (LtCOS) of USUHS Graduates.  This is a Small Business Set-Aside.
Statement of Work:  Long-term Career Outcomes Study (LtCOS) of USUHS Graduates Purpose and General Concept:
The purpose of the LtCOS is three-fold:
1.	To quantify the medical and military professional accomplishments of USUHS medical school graduates (classes of 1980-1999) during their military careers.
2.	To determine whether there are predictive relationships between career accomplishments (outcomes) with social, academic or behavioral characteristics identified either during the medical school application process or the period of enrollment at the university (inputs).							
3.	To compare the career accomplishments of USUHS graduates with a sample of physicians currently serving on active duty who did not attend the USUHS.
It is anticipated that the findings of this study may lead to improvements in the university admissions, student promotions and graduate medical education selection processes.
An expandable relational database composed of input and outcome parameters and incorporating statistical analysis capability will be developed:  
For USUHS graduates the database will be populated with both administrative data currently residing in university electronic databases or hardcopy files and survey data obtained either via a web-based secure and confidential survey tool or via submission of hard-copy surveys.  It is anticipated that most USUHS graduate physicians will use the web-based methodology, but some may prefer to submit hard-copy surveys and that the data set may include input for up to 3300 graduates (all members of the classes of 1980-1999, either currently on active duty or no longer serving on active duty).	Instructions for completion of the survey will be mailed via US Mail to all USUHS graduates.
The database will also be populated by data relating to approximately 2000 non-USUHS graduate physicians currently serving on active duty.  Only survey data will be used for this group, and it is anticipated that nearly all data provided by this group will be via the web-based survey, though some data provided by hard-copy survey submissions may need to be individually loaded.  Instructions for completion of surveys will be conveyed electronically to all non-USUHS graduate physicians via uniformed service channels.
It will be critical that the database be designed to permit comparison between USUHS graduate physicians and non-USUHS graduate physicians, in addition to comparisons related to other elements within each group (social, academic or other demographic data, inputs and outcomes).
Analysis of the data using standard statistical methodology will quantify career accomplishments and enable the university to assess the contributions of inputs to outcomes where existent as regards its graduates and facilitate comparisons between USUHS graduate physicians and non-USUHS graduates physicians currently serving on active duty.  Presentation of data in private and public forums and publication of representative data in the public domain will enhance the desirability of longer-term administrative tracking of outcomes thus alleviating the necessity for survey methodology where practicable.
There are approximately 3300 USUHS graduates and 2000 HPSP graduates whose data will serve as the basis for this study.  The study will run for one year from the award of contract date and the contract is for one year.  
Place and Period of Performance:  The work may be performed on site at the Uniformed Services University, or off site via the internet-based methodology. The period of performance will run for one year. THe start date, shall be within 7 days after award of the contract.  All requirements in this Statement of Work will be completed within one year after the start of the work.
Pricing Method:  Firm Fixed Price – Your firm should provide a single price for the entire effort described in this Statement of Work.  Please describe the methods to be employed and the estimated number of employee hours required. Firms may cap the level of effort that is included in their offer.
Current available funding is limited to $130,000.  If in the opinion of your firm, this is not a sufficient amount to conduct a thorough evaluation, please specify how to best spend available funds, and any tasks that may remain undone, and the additional amounts necessary to complete the evaluation.  If available funds are more than necessary, a lower proposed price will result in a higher evaluation score.
Proposal Instructions:  Proposals should be submitted by e-mail.  Please enter in the subject line the following text, “RFQ Number – Quote from (insert your firm’s name)” Proposals shall not exceed 15 pages.  Proposals may also be faxed to (301)295-1716.
Response due Date: Monday, Jan. 3, 2005 1:00 PM, local time.
Evaluation Factors:  (Listed in the order of importance)
Corporate Experience:  Firms should briefly demonstrate recent experience in managing similar projects.  Please include a point of contact for each customer.
Staffing:  Firms should identify the skills and abilities of the proposed project manager and other significant contributors.
Management Approach:  Firms should briefly describe how they intend to manage this assignment.
Cost:  While price is not the most important evaluation factor, proposed prices will be considered in determining the firm that represents the best value to the government.
Contractor’s Responsibilities-- Elements of Work/Deadlines to be Met:
Advanced Technical Support: 
1.Design expandable relational database to include a statistical analysis package capable of performing standard statistical operations including regression analysis; develop discrete definitions for data element fields.  The contractor will work closely with the University Information Systems (UIS) department which controls other USUHS databases, access to university information management and information technology systems and the university website.  The data and created database will remain the property of the USUHS and the database and web-based survey will not be proprietary contractor-owned products.  The database will be linked to a web-based survey (see below) and access to the database will be limited (password controlled) to those identified by Associate Dean, Student Affairs as having reason for access.  Finally the database must be usable and operational by USUHS after the contract ends with no need for additional contract support.						
2.Develop web-based survey based upon data elements determined by the primary and co-investigators (referred to as the LtCOS working group).  Data obtained via the web-based survey must automatically populate data fields of the expandable relational database.  Enable, test and implement the web-based survey and linkage to the database.  The Web-based survey and relational database must be operational by 31 March 2005.				
3.Populate data fields in the relational database, not otherwise populated by the web-based survey tool using either other currently available, electronically accessible legacy university databases or via extraction of data from hardcopy files currently resident in the Office of Admissions, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of Student Affairs, the Office of Alumni Affairs, the Office of the Commandant or hard-copy surveys returned via the mail or email from USUHS graduates and non-USUHS graduate physicians.  Though it is anticipated that most survey data will be provided via on-line web-based submission data from approximately 750-1000 physicians (combined USUHS and non-USUHS) surveys may have to be loaded manually.  The university will provide, in a single location, all the necessary hard copy files related to its graduates, but most data is available administratively in electronic files.  All data must be loaded into the database by 1 August 2005.	
4.Perform statistical analysis and canned query development where appropriate to quantitate the medical and military professional accomplishments of USUHS and non-USUHS graduates and to relate these outcomes to the inputs.  Comparison data between USUHS and non-USUHS graduates will be crucial.  Portray quantitative data and relational in spreadsheets, graphs and tables and format these for presentation in PowerPoint.  It is envisioned that 30-50 slides and 20-40 tables/figures may be necessary to portray the data or provide submissions for publication. Microsoft software products will be used exclusively for this component of the project.  Data analysis and preparation of slides, tables and figures must be completed by end of contract period.  All spreadsheets or other data fields used to create tables and figures will be provide to the government in electronic format NLT end of the contract period.
The specific elements of data analysis which will be investigated will be determined by USUHS depending upon how robust the data fields seems to be after loading of the data.
Administrative/Clerical Support:  The contractor will perform the following:
1.Manage all correspondence related to the LtCOS including mailing of surveys to USUHS graduates (two mailings may be necessary to enhance response rates), mailing of incentive gifts to survey responders who are USUHS graduates (hard copy and web-based responders), collection of returned hard copy surveys and loading of this data manually into the relational database.  It is envisioned that the first mailing (notification of upcoming survey study) to graduates will go out by 15 March 2005 with subsequent mailings at the end of March 2005 (final instructions, actual survey and web-link) so that data may be provided by the graduates beginning on 1 April 2005.
2.Assist with preparation of manuscripts and presentations.  
Government Responsibilities:  
The Government will provide office workspace, a computer and printer, paper and miscellaneous office supplies, postal addresses and email addresses of USUHS graduates (where available), appropriate software and licensure costs.
Final Submissions:  At the end of the performance period the contractor will provide a comprehensive statistical analysis of professional outcomes of USUHS graduates linked through appropriate statistical methodology to socio-academic-demographic data elements in conjunction comparison analysis with non-USUHS graduates.  Data will be portrayed in PowerPoint slides and appropriately formatted tables and figures for publication.  In addition the contractor will provide instructional materials to USUHS staff so that they may continue to utilize the database without the need for additional contract support.
Government POC:  The government contracting officer appointed to serve as contract POC is John S. Friedhoff at (301)295-3868, and e-mail address JFRIEDHOFF@USUHS.MIL

Another evaluation factor is the offerors management structure.

Evaluation:  

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on a best value basis, the basis of which consists of technical (capability of the items offered to meet the agency need as listed in the SOW), past performance, and price.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the specification strength and quality in the area of the offeror¡¯s technical proposal.  Offerors shall include a detailed product description that highlights specifications and quality.  The technical quote will be significantly more important than past performance and price.  Past performance and price are of equal importance; a neutral rating will be given to offerors without past performance experience.  The Government intends to make a single award for all items.  The price proposals are not rated against standards but will be evaluated for realism, completeness, and reasonableness.  

It is the Government's intent to award to an offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the combined synopsis/solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors to represent the best value to the Government.  The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Government the greatest confidence that it will meet or exceed the requirements affordably.  This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical superiority and/or overall business approach and/or superior past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the best value selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  Professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.
 
Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  

Past Performance:  

Offerors shall provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror's customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of same or similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (NOTE:  Include E-mail address and phone number for references!).  

Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror's record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror's quote.  

Delivery:  

Offerors are directed to FAR 52.211-9 on how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements as follows:  

52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery.  DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUNE 1997)   

(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule.  DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No: CLIN 0001-00003; Quantity:  Various; 150 DAYS/MONTHS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  
 
If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.  However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:  

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.:  CLIN 0001-0003; Quantity:  Various; 210 DAYS/MONTHS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.  

OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.: __________; Quantity: _______; WITHIN _______ DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract.  The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated.  Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term 'working day' excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)  If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  (End of clause)  

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1, Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract.  Acceptance will be by the Ministry of Transportation, Baghdad, Iraq.  

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.212-2 Evaluation ¨C Commercial Items, offerors should submit with their quotation:  (1) a price proposal which shows the proposed unit price for each line item, the extended total price for each line item, and the total overall price for all contract line items; (2) supporting information or product literature/specifications for the proposed items that demonstrates a clear understanding of the specifications stated in the SOW but not exceeding the clause at 52.212-1; (3) a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (MAY 2002), and Alternate I (APR 2002); (4) Contractors Duns and Bradstreet (DUNS) number; (5) Contractors Cage Code; and (6) an affirmation that it has an active registration on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), which is at the website www.ccr.gov.

BACKGROUND 

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates six HU-25D model aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  The HU-25D uses the Telephonics APS143 Radar System.  These aircraft are used in surveillance missions that are performed mainly over water with aircraft and communication system components being exposed to salt-laden environments.  Line Replaceable Units (LRU’s) contained within each system are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking provides, but is not limited to: an individual LRU historical record of repair and/or overhaul; tracking of component time (time since new (TSN)/time in service (TIS), time since overhaul (TSO), and mean time between failure (MTBF); component status; and physical location.

OBJECTIVE

The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center, or equivalent, to effectively repair/overhaul and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 LRU’s.  Repaired/overhauled LRU’s must meet the OEM current specifications and must perform at the system level.  Each LRU when installed shall be required to operate/interact with the other LRU’s within the Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) and Over the Horizon Airborne Sensor Information System (OASIS) without need of adjustment or degradation of system operation.  The system is also comprised of many subcomponents that provide video and power distribution to operate these LRU’s. 

The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to: trained personnel, required tooling, calibrated test equipment, FAA and/or OEM approved replacement parts, publications and documents pertaining to the LRU, preservation and shipping.

The offeror’s responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work.

Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center’s (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the chosen offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  

To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives, the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 

1.	Technical:

a.	Provide detailed work specifications for baseline repair of LRU’s.

b.	Provide a written Performance Metrics plan.  

c.	Provide evidence of an ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.

d.	Possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, and fixtures  to meet the OEM current specifications.

e.	Provide an incentive proposal. 

f.	Provide repercussions for failure to meet Turn-Around-Time (TAT).

2.	Past Performance:
a.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like 
	items.

b.	Provide points of contact for past performance documentation for the past two years.  Include reference’s name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.

3.	Pricing:

Provide a firm-fixed price for repair of the part numbers listed above for ALL years including both Level I and Level II Repairs.

4.	Definitions:

a.	Turn around Time (TAT):  Turn around time is defined as the time item is received at vendor’s facility until item is returned to ARSC or designated Air Station.

b.	Premature Failures:  Premature failures are identified as those failures which occur during testing prior to installation or within the first 250 hours of operation.  Note:  Premature failures found to be “No Fault Found” will not be considered in the premature failure penalty clause.

c.	Level I Repair:  Test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements.

d.	Level II Repair:  Over and above a Level I Repair for units showing excessive degradation.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

6 		Project Descriptions and Profile

USTDA seeks to hire a definitional mission (DM) team to travel to Kenya and Uganda to investigate energy sector opportunities for USTDA funding.  Inexpensive, clean, and reliable energy is critical to the economic well-being of both Kenya and Uganda, and both countries are actively seeking solutions to achieving this level of energy provision for urban, rural, and industrial purposes.  This includes power interconnection between countries, enhanced transmission, and the exploration of new domestic sources of energy generation.  

Through recent USTDA staff travel, the agency has received several requests for feasibility study and technical assistance for both generation and power transmission activities.  These requests have the potential to enhance previous work USTDA had funded in Kenya and Uganda, including in the fields of rural electrification, geothermal energy development, power transmission, and energy regulation.  Bidding teams should be familiar, and ideally have experience, with all of the above-mentioned fields.  

USTDA does not possess full proposals for any of the projects that the DM team will explore.  USTDA will provide some contact information and leads, but bidding teams should be prepared to conduct extensive research in the field, largely using their own resources for contacts and project background information.  The Contractor should be prepared to travel to some extent in coordination with USTDA's Country Manager for Eastern Africa, potentially in mid-February 2005.

3.12.6 		A review of regulatory issues related to the project;

3.12.7	An analysis of key host country economic benefits (Infrastructure/Industry, Human Capacity Building, Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement and/or Market Oriented Reform).  These Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the Host Country. 

The FS/TA Contractor shall focus on what Development Impact is likely if the project is implemented according to the Study recommendations.  While specific focus shall be paid to the immediate impact of the project, the FS/TA Contractor shall include any additional developmental benefits that may result from the project’s implementation, including spin-off and demonstration effects.

Accordingly, the FS/TA Contractor shall assess each of the following categories with respect to the project’s potential Development Impact:

(1)  Infrastructure/Industry:  Provide a statement on the infrastructure impact, giving a brief synopsis.  For example, “The project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve ___ [number] additional households in ____ [area].”

(2)  Market- Oriented Reform:  Provide a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

(3)  Human Capacity Building:  Assess the number and type of local positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of local people who would receive training; describe such potential training program.

 (4)  Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement:  Provide a description of any advanced technologies that would be utilized as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that would be gained (ex. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%”).

(5)  Other:  Describe any other developmental impacts or benefits that would result from the project, for example, follow-on or replication projects, safer workplace or improved financial revenue flows to the Host Country.

<DESC>1.  The subject Request for Quotation (RFQ) is hereby extended from 22 September, 2004, to 27 September, 2004; offers are still due at 5:00 p.m. (local Baghdad time).  Questions regarding this quotation should be directed to Mr. Charles Clements at email charles.clements@cpa-iq.org; faxed quotes will NOT be accepted.  2.  Question:  Do the cars have to be "new" equipment or can they be "refurbished" equipment? 

Answer:  Yes, they must be new equipment

3.  Question:  The End Doors are Sliding Pneumatic Doors.  What are the types of doors required on the side?  Swing or Pneumatic?

Answer:  Side entrance doors are “electropneumatic swing sliding doors”
 
4.  Question:  We do not have specifications for the Bombardier MD523-1.  Are they available to the public anywhere?

Answer:  Specifications and pricing for Bombardier MD523-1 bogies can be obtained by contacting the Bombardier Company at:

Bombardier Transportation Bogies
Siegstrasse 27
57250 Netphen
Germany
Telephone: +49 271 702-0
Fax: +49 271 702-222
http://www.bombardier.com

5.  Question:  The Bogie wheel base seems to be incorrect.  Instead of 600 mm, should it be 2600 mm to 2800 mm?

Answer:  The bogie wheel base should be 2500 mm to 2800 mm. The bogie must be the Bombardier MD523-1 bogies.  Contact the Bombardier Company for the exact dimension on the wheel base if necessary.  

6.  Question:  The Knorr Bremse brake system with 2/pipes of 8 and 5 bars.  We are familiar with the Knorr brake system.  Is there a difference with that and what you are requesting?

Answer:  No.

7.  Question:   The air conditioning/heating system temperatures seem inconsistent.  Can you clarify them for the following:

Answer:  Maximum Summer Sun:         Maximum 80C    Minimum 55C

               Minimum Winter Cold:            Minimum -25C

8.  Question:  The specifications require air-tight perfect seal rubber gangways.  We can not find a 100% perfect seal.  Due to the sand in Iraq this may be impossible to obtain.  Is it necessary for the rubber gangways and the side doors?  

Answer:  A near perfect  seal  is acceptable, given the environment.  Maintaining a positive air pressure in the coaches will help achieve a sand/dust-free environment.

9.  Question:  Can you enlighten us on your definition of Eastern versus Western style restrooms?

Answer:  Western style restrooms have sit-down toilets and Eastern style restrooms have squat-type toilets

10.  Question:  Can you define the acronyms UIC, RIV and RID regulations?
