Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, and energy efficiency in design.  Structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical, data and voice transmission systems, medical gases, and fire and safety systems will meet current codes and standards.  All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA’s pending Hurricane Mitigation Guidelines, as well as the Interagency Security Committee’s and other relevant physical security guidelines.  The space will be compliant with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and PG-18-13 in all areas.  Required services will include preparation of schematics and design development plans, including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost.  The contract will include a government option for: design-build RFP package or construction document preparation; construction period services, and site visits.  The contract will include a second government option to incorporate some or all planning and design services relating to the inclusion of the facilities for Louisiana State University.  At this time, there has been no determination made as to the extent of sharing of services with LSU or whether or not LSU will be designing and constructing separate structures at the VA site.  The possibility also exists that there may be a combination of shared services and new structures for both VA and LSU.  Should LSU decide to build some or all of their facilities themselves, the VA will require extensive collaboration with LSU and their designers.  The completed project should be capable of achieving LEEDS certification.  Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical centers similar to that proposed and with systems integration, such as the VA Hospital Building System, will be considered.  Emphasis will be placed on estimating capabilities and previous successful experience with construction of medical centers, along with the firm’s, or teams’, Quality Assurance /Quality Control procedures.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected firm shall design to the government’s estimated cost for construction.  Applicants must have an established working office within 150 mile radius of New Orleans, Louisiana, be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work, and be licensed in the State of Louisiana.  No firm will be considered unless an application consisting of a completed SF 330 Part I and other evidence of experience and capabilities the applicant considers relevant is received by the VA A/E Evaluation & Program Support Team (181A) Attention: Robert T. Smoot, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20420, five (5) copies are required by 3:30 PM EDT May 2, 2006.  A current SF 330 Part II, representing and differentiating between the personnel, experience and capabilities of all involved offices, must be included with the application together with current SF 330 Part IIs for each proposed consultant’s office involved.  Applicants will be rated based on the relevant experience - advance planning and design on projects of similar scale and scope - of both the firm(s) and assigned individuals, the applicant’s capacity to do the work, record of past performance on VA work, geographic consideration, the participation of minority-owned and women-owned consultants, and demonstrate success in prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, energy efficiency, and systems integration in facility design.  Award of contract is dependent upon the availability of funds.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  If subcontracting opportunities exist and the submitting firm is not a small business, the small, small disadvantaged and women-owned business contracting goals will be:  23% (SB), 5% (SDB), 5% (WOSB), 3% (HUBZone), 7% (VOSB), and 3% (SDVOSB).  ***Note: The “covenant against contingent fee” clause is applicable to this solicitation. ***

<DESC>NAVAIR intends to contract on a sole source basis with Tifco Gage and Gear of Livonia, MI   for Navy Ryder Gears which will be used to analyze load carrying (anti-wear) characteristics of aviation turbine engine oils and helicopter gearbox oils located  at the Naval Air Warfare Center – Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD’s) Fuels and Lubricants Division.  Purchase from Tifco is required to assure the continuity of test results, and the continued functioning of the fuels test program. Additionally, the small market for these gears, coupled with the time required to initiate and validate a manufacturing process with a new contractor would have a significant negative impact on the Government's ability to provide and maintain a supply of quality oils to the fleet.

<SUBJECT>U -- Develop Science Curriculum supplements for high schools
<SOLNBR>263-2006-P(BD)0036
<CONTACT>Marcia  Goldman, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-2302, Fax 301-402-0887, Email goldmanm@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health Office of Science Education, within the Office of the Director, has a requirement for the development of a curriculum supplement on bioethics for high school general biology classes.

The supplement will be a teacher¹s guide centered on five stand-alone lessons that can easily be integrated into topics commonly studied in general high school biology classes nationwide. Laboratory and computer-based activities may be used when they will enhance students¹ learning experience. However, all computer-based activities must have a paper-and-pencil alternative. The supplement must comply with the National Science Education Standards (see www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses
<http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses> ) and the Science Framework for the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP see www.nagb.org/pubs/pubs.html).
 
The supplement will 1) enrich existing curricular materials; 2) provide teachers with an accessible, rigorous, and effective set of lessons on bioethics; and 3) engage students in developing critical thinking and ethical reasoning skills. Students will gain an understanding of specific biomedical practices by engaging in the supplement¹s lessons. They will identify and study the ethical issues that arise as these practices are implemented in society. Students will then examine their own values and beliefs, come to a conclusion that fits within these values and beliefs, and articulate and justify their position on the ethical issues surrounding the biomedical practices.
 
During development, the offeror must field test the supplement in general biology classes at various high schools that collectively represent the intellectual, geographic, and cultural spectrum found across the nation.
 
The final curriculum supplement must be delivered in print ready and Web ready formats. The print ready version must be in InDesign or Quark Express format and include all linked images (as gray scale or CYMK, as appropriate) suitable for professional printing. The Web ready components must run in the IBM Domino/Notes environment and be operable in Apple¹s Safari and Microsoft¹s Internet Explorer Web browsers in Macintosh and Windows platforms.
 
NIH intends for the materials to be freely reproduced and distributed for educational use. The materials will not be used by any organization or business for sale or profit. The period of performance is 2 years.
 
Solicitations will be issued on or about May 15, 2006.  The RFP, RFP amendments, and questions and answers related to this procurement shall only be available via the internet at http//www.fedbizopps.gov.  Offerors are responsible for accessing the website Interested parties must respond to the RFP to be considered for award.  AT this time, no written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking a contractor to manage and operate the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in Argonne, Illinois, Dupage County.  ANL is a multi-disciplinary research laboratory located on 1500 acres approximately 25 miles southwest of Chicago.  The site is owned by DOE and currently operated by the University of Chicago for DOEâ€™s Office of Science. ANLâ€™s mission is to serve DOE and national security by advancing the frontiers of knowledge, by creating and operating forefront scientific user facilities and by providing innovative and effective approaches and solutions to energy, environmental, and security challenges to the national and global well-being. ANLâ€™s scientific and technical experts support a broadly diversified research effort in support of DOE major R&D focus areas.  This includes programs in Basic Energy Sciences, Nuclear Energy Science and Technology, Nanotechnology, High Energy Physics, Computational Science, Nuclear Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science, Environmental Science, Biology, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy, Electric Transmission and Distribution, and work for National Nuclear Security Administration.  Collaboration among the various ANL Divisions, as well as other national and international institutions, is also a major strength and focus of its mission. ANL has several research facilities that are open to outside researchers from industry, academia and other national laboratories on a cost-recovery basis. The ANL research facility includes the following major Laboratory and user facilities: Advanced Photon Source (APS): The APS is a national user facility. The mission of the APS is to produce reliable, tunable x-ray beams for user research. Users at the APS conduct forefront basic and applied research in the fields of material science, biological science, physics, chemistry, environmental, geophysical, and planetary science, as well as x-ray instrumentation.  The APS can accommodate as many as 70 beamlines and serves a user community that exceeds 2500 individual industry, government, and university users. Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS): The IPNS is a national user facility for neutron scattering experiments.  The IPNS provides a dozen neutron scattering instruments, as well as facilities for studying radiation effects. Approximately 250 individual users perform a variety of neutron scattering experiments each year. Argonne Tandem-Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS): The ATLAS facility is a superconducting accelerator for projectiles heavier than the electron. This facility is a DOE National Collaborative Research Facility open to scientists from all over the world.  ATLAS consists of a sequence of machines that produce high precision heavy-ion beams ranging over all possible elements, from hydrogen to uranium, to energies as high as 17 MeV per nucleon and delivered to one of three target areas. Center for Nano-scale Materials (CNM): The purpose of the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) is to create, characterize, and understand the behavior of new functional materials on the nanoscale.  The CNM exploits the unique electronic, magnetic, structural, chemical, and optical properties of individual nanostructures and their ordered arrays and includes examining the behavior and fundamental properties of functional nanocomposites of patterned ferroelectric and magnetic films, bio-inorganic hybrids, nanophotonic phenomena, and assisted self-assembly.  An APS hard x-ray nanoprobe beamline is part of the CNM. Electron Microscopy Center (EMC): The EMC is used to conduct materials research using advanced microstructural characterization methods and an Intermediate Voltage Electron Microscope.  Research includes microscopy based studies in high thermal conductivity superconducting materials, irradiation effects in metals and semiconductors, phase transformations, and processing related structure and chemistry of interfaces in thin films. Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility: The ARM Program was created to resolve scientific uncertainties about global climate change with a specific focus on improving the performance of general circulation models used for climate research and prediction.  The ARM Program establishes and operates three field research sites, called Cloud and Radiation Testbeds (CARTS), in several climatically significant locations. Scientists collect and analyze data obtained over extended periods of time from large arrays of instruments to study the effects and interactions of sunlight, radiant energy, and clouds on temperatures, weather, and climate. Transportation Technology Research and Development (R&D) Center: The Transportation Technology R&D Center brings together scientists and engineers from many disciplines to find cost-effective solutions to the problems of transporting people and goods from one place to another. Argonne's transportation research focuses on three areas: advancing toward an environmentally benign passenger car, from fuel production through recycling of obsolete vehicles; paving the way to safer, cleaner trucks, buses, and locomotives; and improving traffic flow, safety, and security. In addition, ANL performs other non-DOE sponsored research that supports the Laboratoryâ€™s missions.  Through its technology transfer programs, industrial firms and other organizations benefit from ANLâ€™s technological knowledge, which increases the competitiveness of U.S. industry. Anticipated funding (from all sources) for fiscal year 2007 for ANL is approximately $492 million.  DOE expects to award a new performance-based contract during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and will include a 60-day transition period.  All interested parties are requested to submit an Expression of Interest to Jodi VonRox, Source Evaluation Board Executive Secretary, RFP Number DE-RP02-06CH11357, at the following e-mail address: jodi.vonrox@ch.doe.gov.  There is no specific format required except that the RFP number should be referenced.  Submission of an Expression of Interest does not commit an interested party to submit a proposal.   Expressions of Interest should be received no later than 3:00pm Central Standard Time on October 14, 2005. Future information regarding this solicitation will be posted on DOEâ€™s Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at URL http://e-center.doe.gov and/or FedBizOpps at URL http://fedbizopps.gov.  DOE anticipates issuing a draft RFP in the first quarter of FY06.  The draft RFP will be open for comments or questions for approximately 40 days.  DOE expects to conduct a comment workshop, offer site tours and one-on-one meetings with prospective offerors about three weeks after the draft RFP is issued.  Following the issuance of the final RFP, DOE plans on hosting a pre-proposal conference.  Dates and times for the comment workshop, site tours, one-on-one meetings and the pre-proposal conference will be announced at a later date.

<DESC>This announcement shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request or a Request for Proposals of any kind. The FAA is conducting this market survey to identify potential vendors that can perform hardware and software maintenance support of the ATOP system. The Oceanic and Offshore Directorate has developed and deployed the ATOP system at the Oakland, New York, and Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs).  The ATOP automation system creates a single, satellite based, integrated oceanic ATC system for all three oceanic sites. The deployed system makes use of the latest communications and surveillance technology, provides integrated radar data processing capability, and delivers enhanced conflict probe to achieve reduced aircraft separation.  The New York and Oakland ARTCCs are fully operational on the ATOP system, and the Anchorage ARTCC began limited operational use of the system in March 2006. To successfully deploy and maintain the ATOP system, the Oceanic and Offshore (O&O) Services Directorate requires contractor provided staff beyond the levels currently identified in the ATOP contract.  These resources are necessary to provide field maintenance support at the Oakland, New York, and Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Centers and provide on-going second level engineering support at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC).  The O&O Services Directorate has identified the need for this staffing to occur from the August 2006 to July 2011.   The minimum technical software and hardware support capabilities are as follows: 1.  Field Maintenance Support â€¢	Provide hardware remove and replace support for IBM RISC processors,          Sony Displays, Cisco Switches, and ATOP related equipment. â€¢	Provide software maintenance and system administration for AIX systems â€¢	Provide problem determination analysis for the ATOP system components          (Ocean 21, Sunhillo, Micro-EARTS, and Barco Tellar) using ATOP tools          such as FAA maintenance procedures, System Wide Analysis Capability          (SWAC), DR&A database (Requires Source Code access from LMTSS, Adacel,          and Sunhillo). â€¢	Package and test local ATOP software builds â€¢	Create and modify site specific ATOP adaptation (Some activities          require Source Code tool access from LMTSS, Adacel, and Sunhillo). â€¢	Support ATOP training activities at the three oceanic sites 2.  Second Level Engineering â€¢	Perform ATOP system builds (Requires Source Code access from LMTSS,          Adacel, and Sunhillo). â€¢	Utilize ATOP support and analysis tools and interpret data collected          (Requires Source Code tool access from LMTSS, Adacel, and Sunhillo). â€¢	Perform Government-directed PTR corrections (Requires Source Code          access from LMTSS, Adacel, and Sunhillo). â€¢	Develop technical instructions for the implementation of modifications. â€¢	Utilize adaptation tools and create/modify adaptation databases. â€¢	Respond to FAA Help-Desk inquires or requests for assistance. â€¢	Perform configuration management and maintenance of commercially          available software used with the Ocean 21 system. â€¢	Support/Conduct PTR verification testing activities at the WJHTC,          contractor facility or field sites (Some activities require Source          Code tool access from LMTSS, Adacel, and Sunhillo). â€¢	Support/Conduct PTR regression testing activities at the WJHTC,          contractor facility or field sites (Some activities require Source          Code tool access from LMTSS, Adacel, and Sunhillo). â€¢	Support/Conduct baseline regression testing and test suite development          activities at the WJHTC, contractor facility or field sites (Some          activities require Source Code tool access from LMTSS, Adacel, and          Sunhillo). â€¢	Support/Conduct key site testing activities at the field sites (Some          activities require Source Code tool access from LMTSS, Adacel, and          Sunhillo). â€¢	Develop ATOP test scenarios.  Interested vendors shall respond with a technical statement of experience and proven capabilities of working technically equivalent systems in a similar environment, and a proven record of providing timely and efficient support services.  Vendors must address the software and hardware support capabilities identified above.  Vendors shall also provide a transition plan detailing the steps necessary to transfer the support work without impacting system deployment and maintenance support to the three sites and the WJHTC.  Submitted documentation must not exceed 25 pages in length on single sided 8 Â½ by 11 inch paper. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this market survey submission will be solely at the interested vendors expense. Any proprietary information should be marked.  Responses must be received by no later than May 11, 2006.

These fans are required for installation in the Amphibious Assault Direction System (AADS) workstation on ships deploying during the first quarter of FY 07.  These fans are identical to the equipment that is currently installed in the fleet.  This specific component has gone through the shock and vibration testing required for certification of its safety for shipboard installation.  Purchase of any other manufacturer's component would require duplication of the shock and vibration testing performed on the Ametek Rotron fans at a cost estimated to exceed the cost of the fans being procured.  Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to purchase the Ametek Rotron fans.  These items will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 1!  00, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. Period of performance will be 90 days from issuance of the order. NAICS Code 333412 .  Size Standard is 500 employees.  FSC is  4140.

Title:                                Professional Services/Computer Software Development

THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center (COAC) for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), Office of the Clinical Director www.niams.nih.gov , intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Jeffrey Duryea, Ph.D, 77 Springpark Avenue, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130, to continue the development of a semi-automated computer software program for the analysis of erosive changes, using multi modality imaging. The software program is to outline the margins of each carpal bone, on the tomographic slices which has been developed. With this data, 3D rendering can be made of each individual carpal and the erosions will be qualified by identifying the cavities within the margins of the bones. Also, there will be an attempt to modify the computer software to allow it to segment and analyze MRI (Magnetic Resonance) lesions. With the use of MRI, bone has no contrast and changes in the bone structure are detected indirectly by visualizing image intensities, that reflect bone marrow content. With this modality, erosions have a similar appearance as bone edema, and it could be difficult to discern between the two. A critical scientific question is to understand how suspect regions on MRI compare to changes in the bone structure provided by CT (Cat Scan) imaging. Visualization of erosions with conventional radiography is challenging due to the overlying structure. Since x-ray scatter is relatively small for hand radiography, the simulation will be very realistic, except for a reduction in the spatial resolution. Duties: The contractor shall 1) develop semi-automated computer software to segment carpal bones on MRI lesion. The software will run on a Window’s based personal computer, and allow a reader to check the segmentation on each slice, as well as provide the 3D rendering of each bone. Correct computer software design when necessary for the viewing of the segmentation. 2) the contractor shall develop a 3D registration for CT and MRI images. The goal will be to optimize methodology for creating 3D bone volumes on CT, that match the 3D MRI segmentation, well enough so that standard 3D registration techniques can be used to match each carpal bone between the two modalities. 3) The contractor shall investigate x-ray techniques with the use of CT scanning, also to investigate the radiographic appearance of erosions by creating simulated projected projection radiographic images using the 3D data sets provided by the CT. NIAMS wishes to note that the use of the sole source requirement for this service is imperative, so to not make changes in research variables, which would be detrimental to the on-going research project which is currently in progress. Dr. Duryea is one of the leaders in the field of computerized methods for x-ray based assessments. He is one of the only persons on his field that is focused on arthritis research of this nature. Dr. Duryea has been a long time employee of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School. Dr. Duryea, while employed with BWH, has long had great success in biomedical research, as measured by the number of important discoveries, and the size and scope of his research portfolio, and the volume of publications in which he has contributed. This success is the result of the entrepreneurial nature of individual investigators to include Dr. Duryea. Period of Performance: The proposed period of performance for this service is to begin on May 12th, 2006 until the completion of 432 labor hours of research, for the development of the computer software program. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition requirements are not applicable to this acquisition. The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541519. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties are required to review the above requirements, and submit a statement of interest which includes; firm fixed priced,  documentation of the capabilities of meeting the Governments requirements; at least (3) references documenting successful past performance in meeting the Government’s minimum specification, and a proposed plan of completing the statement of work. The submission is due 15 calendar days from the posting of this notice at 8:00 a.m. The submission must also include any prompt payment discount terms, the Duns & Bradstreet number (Duns), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the vendor’s business size. The vendor must also register in the Government’s Contractor Registry System, www.ccr.gov. The determination of the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether synopsis number NHLBI-PB-AR-2006-175/BNJ, may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Rockledge Building 2, Room  6137, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Jeffery Battle, by fax transmission to (301) 480-3345 or by email to battlej2@nhlbi.nih.gov or  hawkinsd@nhlbi.nih.

n.	240 square feet for animal care staff room; 
o.	Five (5) offices of 150 square feet each (750 sq ft).  
Note:  Approval of final configuration of the facility rests with the government.

The contractor shall maintain compliance with Federal, State and Local laws, and NIH regulations such as the following:  1)The Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-544 as amended in 1970, 1976, and 1985) http://www.nal.usda.gov;  2) Standard Operating Procedures for Laboratory Animal Management that conform to the most recent versions of PHS and other public guidance. 3) NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW); 4) Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC); 5) NIEHS Laboratory Health and Safety Minimum Requirement for Contractors; 6) “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (NRC, 1996); 7) FDA “Good Laboratory Practices for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies” (CFR 21 Part 85)

It is anticipated the resulting cost-reimbursement, level-of-effort contract will be for a period of four (4) year and three (3), two (2)-year option periods. For estimating purposes the Government estimated the level-of effort at 43,524 direct labor hours per year as follows:  Professional – 9579 direct labor hours ;Technical - 7440 direct labor hours); Animal Husbandry Staff – 26,040 direct labor hours; Administrative Support - 465 direct labor hours. 

The specific studies will be designed based on research requirements originating within the NIEHS.  It is not possible to anticipate the specific projects in advance. 
A.  	The following describe the anticipated nature of the work. 
1.	The contractor shall be prepared to conduct whole-body inhalation exposure to 2 different gases (24 hours per day for up to 4 consecutive days), nose-only exposures to one liquid aerosol (30 minute exposure per group, three groups per day for up to seven days), whole body exposure to a second liquid aerosol (180 minute exposure per group, three groups per day, twice per week for up to two weeks), non-inhalation (e.g. single oropharyngeal aspiration) exposure to 1 or 2 chemicals.  These studies may run simultaneously and consecutively.  It shall be necessary to conduct several studies while simultaneously preparing the other exposure rooms for exposures to begin immediately after one of the ongoing exposures is completed. 
2.	Mice and rats will be the primary test species.  A large number of genetically-modified mouse strains will be used.  Provisions should be available for use of immuno-compromised animals, and for occasional breeding of one or two mouse strains.
3.	Dose Animals
The principal route of treatment is by inhalation, either whole body or nose only. The exposure regimen may be six (6) hours per day, five (5) days per week, excluding holidays. For studies involving extensive sample collection, exposures of some animals shall be staggered by one day; in these cases exposures shall be conducted six (6) days per week.  Exposures of six (6) hours per day duration shall be completed by 2:30 P.M. so that animals will be available for use by NIEHS researchers after the daily exposure.  Special studies may require exposures of longer duration or on weekends and holidays.
A continuous 23.5 hours/day exposure regimen for up to four (4) days/week shall be necessary for some studies.  Because these exposures must run unattended at night, the appropriate remote monitoring systems must be in place to ensure that personnel are notified immediately if any deviations in airflow or chemical concentrations occur. 
Studies may require treatment by intratracheal instillation, oropharyngeal aspiration, gavage, injection, implants, dermal exposure, feed, or drinking water.

	4.  	Collection of Data and Samples
The data and biological sample collection requirements will be specified in each research protocol.  Requirements in recent studies have included:
	a. 	weekly or bi-weekly collection of body weights and in-life observations on each animal using an automated weighing system
	b.	performing necropsies associated with terminal sacrifices or moribund sacrifices. 
	c.	whole body perfusion with fixative.
	d.	collection of blood from a jugular cannula, cardiac puncture, or orbital bleeding (for kinetic studies multiple samples shall be collected during and after exposure)
	e.	collection of tissues for biochemical analysis, or histopathological evaluation.
	f.	collection of tissues for DNA or RNA isolation.
	g.	collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice and rats.

	5.	The contractor shall measure some experimental endpoints as specified in the research protocols.
In all cases the PO will provide the experimental design in a project protocol. 
The contractor shall be responsible for the animal handling and shall provide the expertise in the operation of the analytical equipment necessary to conduct the measurements. 
The specific end points to be measured shall depend on the needs of the government. These measurements require the setup, calibration, and routine operation of analytical equipment including gas chromatographs (GC's), unrestrained plethysmographs, blood gas analyzer, plate readers, and a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Endpoints may include but are not limited to:
a.	the analysis of samples of tissues and biological materials for indigenous compounds, the exposure compound and it’s metabolites. 
b.	pulmonary function measurements (Buxco system)
c.	the loading by particulates and the effect on pulmonary clearance mechanisms
d.	enzyme activity in tissues or biological fluids
e.	blood gas measurements in rats and mice
f.	blood hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin measurements in rats and mice.

The contract will include Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) such as computers and specialized inhalation equipment.

Contractor provided material shall include genetically altered rats/mice; general office supplies; animal supplies such as tyvek suits,feed, and bedding; all anesthetics, drugs and controlled substances used in veterinary medicine.

<DESC>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, with Ani Lytics, Inc. for the analysis of clinical tests from on-going trails.  This Notice of Intent is being issued as NOI6041.  The statutory authority for this acquisition is FAR 13.501 and award is anticipated to be made under a Firm Fixed Price Order.  The acquisition documents and incorporated provisions and classes are those in Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-03.  This acquisition will be processed under the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541380 and the business size standard is $6 million.  The period of performance will start day of award and will cover one (1) year service.  NIAID studies the etiology, pathogenesis and prevention of viral hepatitis and other diseases.  Current research efforts include elucidation of the molecular virology of hepatitis A and the development of a live-attenuated hepatitis A vaccine, delineation of the genetic heterogeneity of hepatitis C virus and characterization of the immune response to it, the diagnosis and prevention of hepatitis E and the molecular and biological characterization of newly discovered hepatitis C-like viruses of humans and primates.  These activities require the inoculation of animals, principally nonhuman primates with clinical materials and the study of the resulting response of the animals.  This requires testing animals for physiological, immunological and biochemical changes over time.  A critical part of this analysis is testing serum liver enzyme levels, bilirubin level, other clinical chemistry values and hematologic changes.  The tests to be performed are Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (ICD), Amino Aline Transferase (ALT) and Gamma Glutamine Tranferase.  These tests are non-routine analyses established exclusively at Ani Lytics Inc. expressly for this study.  Since Ani Lytics has extensively performed this test for NIAID in the past they must continue to provide the testing in order to compare data analyses and maintains consistency in results.  FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements because the NIAID has used this company for extensive testing for many years and it is very important that the data obtained in the future can be compared with data obtained in the past.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can perform the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material insufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541611   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), ENERGY STAR Residential Branch (ESRB), in Washington, DC intends to award a firm fixed-price purchase order to the Manufactured Housing Research Alliance (MHRA) of New York, NY under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The purpose of this acquisition is to implement an integrated outreach and sponsorship program that increases manufactured home retailers' participation  in marketing and selling ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes to consumers, and increases the level of sponsorship of these homes in the form of a coordinated incentive program at the regional/local levels.  The target audience under this effort will be manufactured home retailers, state trade  associations, state-based energy efficiency sponsorship programs, lenders, and local power suppliers.  The primary benefits are the reduction of residential energy use and reduced air pollution generated as a result of burning fossil fuels used to produce energy-a key component of CPPD's mission.  Under this order, MHRA will utilize major industry events to directly reach retailers and to obtain their support of the ENERGY STAR program. This task will include identifying target markets, contacting associations, and conducting seminars, staffing trade show booths, and reporting the impact of  these efforts on ENERGY STAR qualified home orders as well as comments on collateral material from six targeted events. In addition, MHRA will promote the sales of ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes in three key manufactured housing markets by bringing together and integrating the efforts of  organizations within the markets that share the goal of promoting improved energy performance and by attempting to unite existing programs under the ENERGY STAR brand. This task will include identifying three target markets with high levels of manufactured home sales and a strong likelihood of  finding partners that will support the program, contacting key players, developing a local program, and monitoring and reporting results.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541611. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. It has  been determined that MHRA is uniquely qualified to promote ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes to manufactured home retailers as well as to local sponsors such as state and local energy efficiency offices and utilities  because of its role as the research arm of the manufactured housing  industry.  In this role, MHRA has a detailed knowledge of how the manufactured housing industry markets and promotes manufactured homes, specifically how retailers market and sell these homes to consumers.  In working closely with manufactured homebuilders, retailers, industry trade associations,  and state/local energy efficiency programs to combine the resources of these organizations to be more effective in promoting ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes as an opportunity to reduce energy consumption and improve air quality, MHRA possesses specialized knowledge of energy efficiency  sponsorship programs at the state and local levels and how incentives can be combined to make ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes a more attractive purchase option for consumers.  In addition, MHRA helped develop manufacturing and quality control procedures that laid the groundwork for what  became the guidelines used by all plants to construct ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured homes.  As such, MHRA has an intimate knowledge of ENERGY STAR qualified homes and the cost and environmental benefits that are attractive to homebuyers. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of  meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement may be considered. The estimated value of this procurement is below the simplified acquisition threshold as set forth in FAR 2.101. Responses to posting must  be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via the e-mail link below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command Acquisition Center (RDECOM AC) intends to solicit on a sole source basis Mitretek Systems of Falls Church, VA for an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) cost-plus-fixed-fee (comp letion type) contract.  The Government anticipates this being a five (5) year contract.  The authority for the sole source action is 10 U.S. C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source And No Other Supplies Or Services Will Sa tisfy Agency Requirements.   The objective of this contract is to provide the Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (ECBC) Research and Technical (R&T) Directorate with research, development, technical management, and administrative support for the exec ution of its assigned programs in basic research and exploratory development.  ECBCs minimum needs can only be satisfied by Mitreteks unique capability of providing independent, conflict-free support to ECBC in the areas of performance testing, research and development. Mitretek Systems is specifically structured to be free from organizational conflicts of interest and has access to proprietary information, government facilities, and personnel beyond that normally granted to contractors. Because of Mitret ek Systems corporate framework as a nonprofit company working in the public interest, it will be able to perform technical analysis with independence and objectivity.  However, the contractor is required, in addition to being free of conflicts of interest,  to stand apart from any unfair competitive advantage that would accrue from preparing program-wide analyses and reviews involving inputs from the various competitive contractors.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<CONTACT>Chester Keller, (803)806-1537
<DESC>(Synopsis) The South Carolina Army National Guard (SCARNG) has a requirement to procure a commercially-available Automatic Flight Following System (AFFS). The requirement includes delivery of the AFFS, installing it on Army aircraft and ground vehicles,  integrating it with existing aircraft systems such as the Vibration Monitoring System (VMS), and operation, testing   and evaluation of the AFFS as installed.  The requirement also includes training of National Guard personnel in the installation, maintenance and oper ation of the AFFS and its associated equipment.      This equipment and these tasks are needed to provide logistical support for a Pilot Project System that can demonstrate capabilities in the following operational exercises: * Real-time acquisition and monitoring of aircraft mechanical (vibration) performance  while in flight;  * Monitoring of  aircraft and ground vehicles during military training exercises;  * Multi-agency (ARNG, DHS, State public safety) training exercises for national or regional disasters. The System must have been integrated with an aircrafts vibration monitoring and health and unit monitoring systems (VMS and HUMS, respectively) and have been successfully flight tested by the US military. A proposed system must be currently operational on  military helicopters. The aircraft systems must have demonstrated the capability to send aircraft mechanical (HUMS) data messages every 5 seconds continuously while in flight.  1.    The proposed system shall be capable of two-way (transmit/receive) text messaging.  2.    The proposed systems mobile equipment shall consist of the CP-2 family of mobile satellite transceivers, small patch antennas, and Control/Display Units.  3.    For enhanced communications security (low probability of interception/detection (LPI/LPD)), the mobile satellite transceiver shall transmit Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) with a bandwidth of at least 2 MHz, in order to minimize Power Spectral  Density. The system shall not require that the entire bandwidth be dedicated exclusively to the proposed system. The nominal transmit duration for a location report shall be less than 30 milliseconds. Transmissions shall be asynchronous transmit-on-demand .  4.    The system shall be FAA-licensed and operating in the Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) frequency bands.  5.    The proposed aircraft equipment shall have airworthiness approval for helicopter operations from either the FAA or the US military.  6.    The proposed system shall use CommTrack application software for its operations work Stations at McEntire ANG, NGB, Pine Ridge, and other operational locations.  7.    Timeliness of reports is imperative; i.e., the delays (and variation in delays) in reporting must be minimized. The proposed system shall have a communications latency of less than five (5) seconds, regardless of system demand or capacity. The system  shall have demonstrated the operational capability to provide asset location (latitude, longitude, altitude) and ground speed every five (5) seconds with minimal latency.  8.    This multi-agency exercise is planned to include the Customs & Border Protection Air and Marine Operations Center (AMOC) at a location to be determined (TBD). The proposed system must be fully integrated and operational with the C&BP AMOC center. In addition, this exercise is intended to demonstrate the interoperability of the proposed Network Operations Center to seamlessly integrate data communications from various terrestrial and satellite communication networks in a manner that is transparent to t he user. This interoperability will also demonstrate the proposed systems ability to maintain the integrity of communications security while supporting multi-agency interoperability.  Offerors shall submit three copies of their technical and price proposals along with brochures and commercial price lists and Past Performance information with full description of sales with cont act points of reference over the past three years.  Delivery of AFFS is 60 days after contract award, FOB Destination (McEntire ANG Base, Eastover SC 29044).  The services (installation, integration, operation, testing and evaluation, training of Governmen t personnel) shall be provided for a full calendar year after contract award.  The services component of the contract will have four option years.  The services may be required at Huntsville, AL; Washington, DC; March ARB, CA; and other locations, in addit ion to McEntire ANG Base.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government. Evaluation and selection of Contractor will be based on the following selection criteria, which are listed in order of importance.  (1) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules, (s ub-factor relevant experience with similar contracts, particularly those for systems monitoring).  Past performance includes performance of the proposed AFFS equipment   Past performance information must clearly demonstrate that the proposed AFFS equipment  has the above described characteristics and capabilities, and that it performs reliably.  (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, (sub-factor, management staff and support staff).  (3) Price- the Government will e valuate offers for award purposes by including the price of the option years in the total price for the requirement.  (This evaluation does not obligate the Government to exercise the options.)  Past performance and Technical when combined are significantl y more important than price, subject to the funding range between $750K and $1.5M for the AFFS equipment, and between $750K and $1.7M for the services for the base year.  Offerors must demonstrate their financial capacity to perform.  To do so, offerors mu st submit a letter from their Financial Institution. The NAICS code for the acquisition is 334511.

<DESC>NEW RESPONSE DATE FOR PHASE 1 ------BUILDING 31 CONSTRUCTION.  This announcement is for a fixed-price design/build contract for construction of a new building of approximately 31,000 gross square feet to house laboratory, support services and administrative functions on the campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana.  This acquisition is being conducted on behalf of NIH by the Indian Health Service, Division of Engineering Services (IHS/DES) under an interagency agreement pursuant to the Economy Act.  The building footprint is nominally 68’x138’ with basement level, two full stories above ground, and a mechanical penthouse.  The exterior appearance and floor plans are defined.  The building is conceived as a steel frame structure with exterior combination of brick and metal panels.  The design and construction will include completion of all design details, connections to central campus systems (including steam, regular and emergency power, chilled water, communications, and security access), equipment requirements, finishes, and furnishings for a complete functional structure.  Specialized requirements include adherence to National Institutes of Health Design Guidelines, vibration isolation, noise mitigation and blast damage resistance.  The work includes demolition of three existing buildings, including one that occupies the new building site and two that will be demolished approximately 30 days after acceptance of the new building. The demolition will involve hazardous materials.  Offerors will be evaluated using Two-Phase Design/Build Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that will result in an award based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The general dollar magnitude of the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The estimated period of performance is eighteen months.  Responses to phase one of this procurement will consist of relevant experience (example projects); past performance; key personnel; general technical approach; quality control program; and representations and certifications.  The information will be evaluated and up to five firms may be selected to submit technical and price proposals in phase two.  Phase one evaluation factors include past performance, experience, capacity, and quality.  Phase two evaluation factors may include quality of overall management plan, including phase one elements; technical solution responsiveness and quality; and price.  Price and the overall technical rating are of approximately equal weight.  Evaluation of price may involve total price or evaluation of scope/design options within the published budget for award.  The phase two technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, small business subcontracting effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.   Phase one of this solicitation will be issued on or about 17 April 2006 and will be posted on this website.  Phase two will be issued to the short listed offerors after evaluation of phase one responses. Firms formally organized as design-build entities or design firms and construction contractors that have associated specifically for this project may submit proposals. In the latter case, a single design firm or construction contractor may offer more than one proposal by entering into more than one such association.  This solicitation is being conducted on an unrestricted basis.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.   Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in order to participate in this procurement (http://www.ccr.gov).

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is requesting small businesses to submit their experience and qualifications by May 4 in order to determine whether or not to set-aside a solicitation. Responses from small businesses will be reviewed to determine if at least two are deemed qualified, in which case the solicitation will be a set-aside, and not full and open. Whether full and open or set-aside for small business, the solicitation will be a competitive procurement. CDC is seeking small businesses capable of proposing on an incrementally-funded cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with a five (5) year period of performance beginning October 1, 2006, under NAICS Code 541720.  The existing contract #200-2001-00110, awarded to the Academy for Education Development in the amount of $3,662,794.00, expires September 30, 2006.  The date specified for receipt of proposals will be approximately 30 days after the issue date of the Request for Proposal (RFP) 2006-Q-08507, which is anticipated to be issued on or about May 12, 2006.  The RFP will be available only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov/  A wage determination has not been requested since the requirement involves meaningful numbers of professional employees as defined in FAR Subpart 22.11.  All responsible small businesses may respond to this notice and provide their experience and information on similar contracts performed by emailing Sam Jamison: esw2@cdc.gov. 

Background:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) seeks to prevent the most serious health risk behaviors among children, adolescents and young adults.  To accomplish this mission DASH implements four strategies: 1) monitors six categories of priority health risk behaviors and school health policies and programs to address them throughout the United States and its territories; 2) synthesizes research findings to identify policies and practices that are most likely to be effective in promoting healthy behaviors among young people. Research-based recommendations for school health programs are featured in a series of publications called the CDC guidelines for school health; 3) funds programs to enable its constituents to implement adolescent and school health programs; and 4) provides evaluation technical assistance (TA) to funded Non-Government Organizations and state and local agencies to help them evaluate the quality and effectiveness of their school health policy development and implementation, curriculum design, professional development activities, and program impact on students.  Most causes of health threats to children and youth are related to six behaviors including: (1) tobacco use; (2) dietary patterns that contribute to disease; (3) insufficient physical activity; (4) sexual behaviors that result in HIV infection, other sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and unintended pregnancy; (5) alcohol and other drug use; and (6) behaviors that result in unintentional injuries and violence.

Description of Work:
The Contractor, in collaboration with DASH and other contractors (including but not limited to those providing programmatic or technical services), shall (1) provide intensive program evaluation TA (ITA) by phone, e-mail, or in-person to selected DASH-funded partners; (2) develop and assess the usefulness of evaluation resources, reports, and tools (electronic, for presentation, and in print) to aid funded partners in conducting program evaluations through clear and consistent ITA messages; (3) promote, market and assess the usefulness of evaluation TA activities to DASH funded partners through development and distribution of marketing materials; (4)  plan, develop, implement, and follow-up on evaluation workshops and trainings as requested; and (5) develop and/or maintain a system by which records of program evaluation ITA will be shared with DASH staff, contractors, and funded partners.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration’s Office of Research and Development conducts a variety of research programs for improving rail transportation efficiency and safety.  Frequently, these programs are derived from short-term reactive conditions requiring the research to be performed as expeditiously as possible.  FRA’s intent is to award a Multiple Schedule IDIQ contract to 2 or more vendors in fulfilling these stated requirements.   This proposed acquisition is intended as a mechanism for providing timely responses in such instances, as well as to provide a mechanism for the support of programmed research.  As discrete research requirements are defined, individual task orders will be established under this contract to address specific research needs.  General topic areas which may be included in a task are: Railroad Vehicles; Non-electric Motive Power and Components: Hazardous Materials Transportation by Railroad; Railroad Operating Practices; Human Factors; Railroad Track, Structures and Components; Track-Train Interaction; Passenger and Freight Operations; Advanced Rail Systems Technology, including Positive Train Control; Railroad Signal, Communication, Control and Electric Traction Power.  Individual task orders may involve one or more of the above areas.  In the past, Human Factors Engineering has represented at least 20% of the overall effort of the contract.  It is estimated that roughly 36,000 labor hours of effort at an estimated cost of $5,000,000 will be required over the 3-year period of the contract term.  The RFP will also contain 2 optional years requiring roughly 10,000 labor hours per year.  The solicitation will be issued electronically using Fed Biz Ops on February 21, 2006.  No written copies will be available.

<DESC>The Solicitation is Ammended to replace Attachment 6 with a new Attachment 6.  The new list of Equipment and Special Facilities to be provided by the Contractor now include the following: 
A. Facilities for Animal Receipt, Housing, Treatment, and Care.
B. Facilities for safe receipt, storage, and use of toxic and radio-labeled chemicals.
C. Metabolism cages which permit humane housing of rats and mice for extended times and allow separate collection of urine, feces, exhaled volatiles and CO2.
D. Equipment for quantative chemical analysis (e.g., high performance liquid chromatogaphy (HPLC), gas liquid chromatography, UV-visible spectrometer plus the usual complement of minor laboratory eqipment).
E. Equipment for quantitative analysis of Radioactivity in chemical and biological samples (e.g., liquid scintillation counter, biological sample oxidizer, HPLC radiodetector).
F. Equipment for studies of chemical metabolism in vitro (e.g., incubator, homogenizer, centrifuges, water baths and extraction apparatus). 
G. Equipment for isolation and identification of metabolites of chemicals studied (e.g., mass spectrometers including the capability of performing liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers).
End to Ammendment 1 to RFP NIH-ES-06-01.
The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is soliciting offers for a contract to study the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) chemical disposition in mammals. The purpose of the project is to obtain detailed chemical disposition data from 3 to 6 studies of selected environmental contaminants or model compounds per year. Most of these studies will be required in laboratory rats (Fischer 344) and/or mice (B6C3F1); however, some studies may require other laboratory animals (other rodent species or dogs).  Most of the studies will address the disposition of organic chemicals or environmental contaminants; however, studies of inorganic chemicals may also be requested.  Individual studies may vary in complexity from preliminary investigations of chemical absorption to detailed studies of all phases of chemical disposition, toxicokinetics, and metabolism.  The immediate goal of these studies is to determine more accurately the doses for National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassay studies.  The long range goal is the accumulation of data that will permit a better assessment of structure-activity for chemical absorption, metabolism and disposition in laboratory animals and to better interpret the significance of these data to man.  A study shall consist of the determination of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a selected compound in a given species. Identification of unknown metabolites may be complex enough to be considered a separate study.  Estimation of toxicokinetic parameters may be requested for selected chemicals.  One or more studies per year may be requested to investigate the comparative metabolism of chemicals in human and rat liver microsomes or hepatocytes in vitro. The compounds for study shall be selected and provided by the Project Officer.  Unless a satisfactory analytical procedure is available for unlabeled compounds and both parties agree to its use, radio labeled compounds shall be provided to facilitate the assay.  In most instances, the initial studies shall be performed in male rats; however, the Project Officer shall reserve the right to require studies in female rats or additional species.  Male animals are studied initially to avoid the influence of estrogenic hormones on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes.  The protocol for the study shall be developed by the Principal Investigator in cooperation with the Project Officer.  The government estimates that the project will require the work of 2 professional man-years and 3 technical/administrative personnel man-years in each contract year.  The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator shall have a minimum of 5 years Post-Doctoral Degree experience.  The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator shall demonstrate experience in specific areas by manuscripts or publications as described in the evaluation criteria.  The estimated annual level of effort is 9,980 labor hours.  Award of two cost-reimbursement, level of effort contracts (the work on the contract involves continuous activity with no clearly defined end point) on an open competition basis is contemplated as a result of this solicitation.  The contracts obtained under this solicitation will continue the work of two similar contracts.  The period of performance for the contract is five years, beginning on or about March 1, 2007 through February 28, 2012.  Five (5) one-year options extending the performance of the contract beyond the fifth base year are planned.  Should a study using dogs be initiated it will be included as an option.  Interested organizations should fax a request for RFP NIH-ES-06-01 to the attention of Mr. David Sedgley, Contract Specialist at (919) 541-2712 or send an e-mail request to sedgley@niehs.nih.gov.  Information regarding this solicitation with instructions for submission of proposals and evaluation criteria will be available on the Internet at:  http://www.niehs.nih.gov/dert/rcb/rfp.htm.  An electronic copy of the RFP (without the attachments) will be posted to this site on or about April 6, 2006.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Expected release date of the RFP is April 6, 2006 with proposals due May 24, 2006.  This requirement is unrestricted.  NAICS Code is 541710.

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to a question regarding the original posting of this RFI. Question:  We are unclear as to the context of this statement (listed below) in relation to the preceding and subsequent requirements in the RFI.  Could you please clarify / explain this requirement in more detail? The radar must have a flexible capability to notch on transmit to a depth of 30 dB for user-specified notch-widths larger than 25 KHz .

The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) desires the acquisition of a multi-purpose warhead for use on the 2.75 inch hydra rockets fired from Special Operation Forces (SOF)aviation platforms.USSOCOM intends to qualify a multi-purpose warhead that is effective against an array of targets to include buildings, bunkers and ships. (1) Penetration: When mounted on a MK66 rocket motor and fired, the warhead will function after penetrating 24 inches of reinforced concrete and??four feet of timber/earthen bunkers at typical engagement ranges. (2) Non-Developmental / In Service Status: The multi-purpose warhead must be non-developmental and qualified by other allied North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries. (3) Mass/Center of Gravity (CG) Flight Characteristics:??When mounted on a Hydra rocket motor, the warhead will have a similar mass and center of gravity when compared to the M229/M151 warhead to insure?minimum need to change supporting fire control instrumentation (weapon racks) or effect ongoing spiral developments (precision kill weapon system).     (4) Incendiary Effect: The multi-purpose warhead must provide an incendiary effect to create secondary fires after impact. (5) Training Warhead: It is desired that the vendor provide an inert day/night warhead (to replace the M274) warhead that provides a visible hit signature. The new warhead should minimize unexploded ordnance (UXO) hazards. When deployed overseas, the new warhead should allow SOF forces to conduct training on allied ranges without creating UXO hazards or creating in-advertent range fires. (6) Facilities, Expertise and Safety: These warheads should meet stringent Navy Weapon System Explosive Safety Review Board (WSESRB) requirements /standards. The warheads should provide for reduced reaction from outside stimuli (Insensitive Munitions (IM)characteristics and provide for good performance after undergoing storage in various environments. ** Responses to this market survey are due on or before 21 Apr 2006 and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information received. Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  STATEMENT OF WORK: An inventory code system, hereby referred to as Networx Inventory Code (NIC) system is required in support of the General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Networx program. The Networx program will provide mission critical telecommunications services to government agencies. The FAS Networx program consists of two acquisitions- Networx Universal and Networx Enterprise.    As existing contracts expire, agencies expect FAS to award replacement contracts that will enable agencies to maintain continuity of existing telecommunication services and to procure the next generation of telecommunication services. The NIC system will be the designated vehicle for creating, maintaining, and reporting of the NIC and related data items.  The Government is seeking information from perspective Contractors to provide a NIC system. The term “Contractor” includes contractor personnel, subcontractors, and consultants. All contractor personnel shall be considered procurement officials and will be subject to the provisions of Section 17 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41.U.S.C.423).  The NIC System shall consist of a database, web based user interface and reporting tools that can be used to create, inventory and manage the NICs and related data items for GSA and other Governmental Agencies. The volume of records in the NIC system will exceed 50,000 records. The NIC System shall support a flexible ad hoc reporting system. Users shall be able to run reports against Network Site Codes (NSCs), NICs, and related data items.  DELIVERABLES:  The deliverables resulting from this work shall meet three goals of GSA: 1) The NIC System shall be the master repository for NSC, NICs, Detail Records and related data items.  2) Utilization by the Telecommunications Service Providers of a system they are familiar with and use as part of their commercial business. 3) Utilization by the Telecommunications Service Providers of a standardized coding scheme for inventorying services delivered by the service providers.  REQUIREMENTS: The following represents four high level requirements for the implementation of the NIC system:  1) Modification of Existing Commercial System: The NIC system shall be a modification of an existing commercial system and shall be designed to support the creation, maintenance and reporting of the NIC and related data items. 2) Migration of GSA FTS 2001 Service Delivery Points (SDP) to the NIC System: As part of this work effort, the Contractor shall migrate the existing GSA SDPs into the NIC database, to include identifying the Serving Wire Center (SWC) for each such NSC.

Conduct user training for GSA personnel, b. Develop train the trainer materials for GSA personnel, c. Develop training materials for GSA vendors. 4) Hosting the NIC System: The Contractor shall make provisions for hosting the NIC system and provide related support as a managed service on an ongoing basis.  This support shall cover both the system, and the codes and data relating to the system.  The ongoing service will be covered in a separate commercial license agreement between GSA and the selected Contractor.  The Contractor will be responsible for providing an end-to-end, commercially available, proven coding system/application for the Federal Government in support of the Networx project. The NIC system will be used for several purposes: ordering, billing, inventory management, service management and reporting. The NIC system shall consist of alphanumeric characters which represent a NSC.  The NSC will use geographical and geopolitical codes to represent buildings, structures, enclosures or other fixed, physical locations. The NSC will be provided by the Contractor. The NIC will consist of the NSC plus additional characters representing the contract and service ordered by an Agency at a specified network site. The NIC shall be provided by the Contractor.. for those locations where dedicated access is required for the service ordered, the NSC is used to determine the SWC that serves the SDP.

<CONTACT>Debra Bruner, 502-315-6208
<DESC>This project involves the construction of a new 68,000 square feet multi-use laboratory building that will house the Forest Product Laboratorys (FPL) Engineering Mechanics, Composites, Wood Preservation, and Durability Laboratories and shared buildi ng support. The proposed project also includes the construction of an approximately 7,000 square foot addition to the existing Fire Research Laboratory.  The project involves preparing the utilities for the installation of new equipment into the Advanced F iber Processing and Paper Products Laboratory in Building 29.   The project also involves the renovation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning in Building One and the administrative office structure. All of the planned improvements include a total of approximately 75,000 square feet of new building footprints within a total work area of approximately 3.5 acres.  The 68,000 square foot multi-use laboratory will be constructed using a combination of structural steel and structural wood elements.  The laboratory will be a 2-story structure with high bay areas in many of the labs.  Some of the space will house small l abs, environmental chambers, tool shops and storage areas.  Specialty items that will be included in the Engineering Mechanics portion of the multi-use laboratory facility include the construction of a strong floor and a mobile strong wall that can be used  to resist reactions when applying loading tests to one story structures.  A specialty item that will  be constructed in the Durability Laboratory portion of the multi-use laboratory is a customized, fully enclosed, temperature and humidity controlled cham ber that will be used to apply wind, rain, ultraviolet light, and heat to one-story specimens.  The Wood Preservation portion of the multi-use laboratory will require construction for pressure treating of wood specimens with computerized temperature contro ls.  It will also require construction of spaces to be used for fungal cellars to conduct accelerated testing of treated-wood durability over a range of simulated conditions.  In addition to the spaces for fungal cellars, spaces for environmentally control led chambers that enable research with fungi and termite species under controlled conditions will need to be constructed.  The Composites portion of the multi-use facility will require installation of a sophisticated exhaust system to control ventilation a round sensitive laboratory equipment. The improvements to the Fire Research Laboratory include construction of an approximately 7,000 square foot fire test facility addition with equipment that would enable simulation of fire scenarios, improve validation of computer models, and evaluate protection options or design changes. Facilities to be included in the project consist of afterburners to exhaust stacks to minimize air pollution and a large scale adjustable hood with a capacity for testing fires up to 8 megawatts (MW). Pulping and bleaching equipment in the Advanced Fiber Processing and Paper Products Laboratory located in Building 29 are proposed to be modernized or replaced to enable pilot-scale trial runs of small-diameter pulping and papermaking proce ssing necessary for continued research. Construction efforts for this portion of the project will involve providing the utility connections for the proposed equipment. Building One improvements include renovation of the central heating, ventilation, air-co nditioning, and electrical service for approximately 170,000 square feet of occupied office space. Because the building is occupied and would continue to be occupied during the improvements, logistics of the project will require the installation of swing s pace work areas in portions of the building that will be vacated by other moves.  Multiple starts and stops are anticipated as spaces are vacated prior to construction and then reoccupied once improvements are complete.  Improvements to Building One would ensure compliance with the American Societ y of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standard for ventilation for acceptable indoor air quality (ASHRAE 62-1989). This project is planned for advertisement on approximately 1 October 2006.  The NAICS code is 236220 with an e stimated price range of over $10,000,000.  This project will be a Request for Proposal including a technical proposal and a price proposal when issued.  All interested Section 8a, HubZone or Service Disabled Veteran Owned small businesses should notify thi s office in writing by mail or fax 502.315.6195 by 5 May 2006 at 4:30 p.m. local time in Louisville, KY.  Reponses should include (1) identification of company as Section 8a, HubZone or Service Disabled  Veterans Owned Small Business (2) Past Experience to  include a description of completed construction projects in this price range and similar in scope to the proposed project.  Provide the percent of self performed work and how it was accomplished on the projects provided (3) Capability of obtaining perform ance and payment bonds for projects over $10,000,000 and (4) a statement verifying the contractor will self perform at least 20 percent of the work and how it will be accomplished.  Send your responses to the US Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District , 600 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Place, Room 821, Louisville, KY 40202-2230 to the attention of Debra Bruner.  NOTE:  This is NOT a Request for Proposal, this is for information only.

<SUBJECT>A -- Increase in ceiling and extension
<DESC>This is a sole source procurement to increase the ceiling and to extend the ordering period of an existing contract with L-3 Communications Titan Corporation, Pulse Sciences (formerly, Titan Corporation Pulse Sciences Division).  The increase in the ceiling is $8.5 million from the current ceiling of $35.0 million to a new ceiling of $43.5 million.  The ordering period is extended from 31 December 2006 to 31 March 2007.  The scope of work of this Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract DTRA01-02-D-0005 is to provide a broad range of recurring requirements for scientific, technical, application engineering and scientific services, technical support, analysis services, facility engineering and technology and supplies.   The major purposes of the contract are to procure specialized expertise and services essential for performing system development and engineering qualifications tests, survivability demonstrations, modeling and validation and certification requirements analysis and pulsed power experiments.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) terawatt-class radiation simulators are Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and are customized to provide the test environments needed by the Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) communities.  The raise in ceiling and the extension of the ordering period are required because of an unexpected amount of customer testing and additional tasks placed on the contract in support of simulator development above estimated operation and maintenance costs.  There has been an average increase of 31% /year of external test customer support and $1.8M above average cost per year for maintenance and repair.  The extension to the contract is required to allow for continued support until the re-compete is complete.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1) implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE  PROPOSALS.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

ADDENDUM TO FAR PROVISION 52.212-2, EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE ON STANDARD FORM 1449)

(a)  BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:  The basis for award will be an integrated assessment based on tradeoff between past performance and price.  The Government will award the contract to the offeror who represents the best value to the Government in terms of past performance and price, as outlined below.  The government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror.  In a performance price tradeoff, the Contracting Officer will only clarify the offerors’ information; no discussions are contemplated in accordance with FAR 15.306.  Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify relevance or adverse past performance to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Clarifications are limited exchanges between the Government and offerors that may occur when award without discussions is contemplated.

      (1)  PAST PERFORMANCE:  Past performance confidence assessment shall be accomplished for all offerors, and each offeror shall be assigned one of the following ratings:

RATING	DEFINITION
	
High Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
	
Significant Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
	
Satisfactory Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
	
Unknown Confidence	No performance record identifiable (see FAR 15.305(a)(2) (iii) and (iv)).
	
Little Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Changes to the offeror’s existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements.
	
No Confidence	Based on the offeror’s performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

a.  A number of past performance references provided by offerors will be selected and investigated.  Any derogatory past performance information obtained will be presented to the affected offeror and that offeror will have an opportunity to respond with any mitigating facts.  The final determination of past performance ratings shall rest with the contracting officer.

b.  An offeror with limited or no recent or relevant past performance will receive a rating of Neutral/Unknown Confidence, and will not be rated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

c.  Past performance shall be evaluated on the basis of the following sub factors of equal importance:

1)  Quality of Work
2)  Timely Performance
3)  Management Effectiveness
4)  Cultural and Environmental Work Performance

    (2)  PRICE:

a.  Completeness:  The proposal covers all requirements of the performance work statement, includes all pricing information required by the solicitation, and the Price Schedule is completed as required.

b.  Reasonableness:  Prices are reasonable in comparison to estimates, prior prices paid, other offers received and can be supported by suitable estimating techniques.

c.  Realism:  The government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between the line items or subline items.  Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated, as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques.  For example, if unique and innovative approaches are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented.  The burden of proof of realism rests solely with the offeror.  A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the government.

     (3)  PAST PERFORMANCE SHALL BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN PRICE.

(b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
