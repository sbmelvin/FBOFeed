<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for the Purchase, Lease and Maintenance of NASTRAN proprietary software.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) under FAR 13.5 (Test Program for Certain Commercial Items) authorized by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from MSC Software Corporation, Mount Laurel, NJ, who is the only known responsible source capable of meeting the agency's requirement.  This determination is based on a Sources Sought Notice which was posted October 17, 2003.  The combination of market research and the Government's evaluation of the sources sought responses, determined MSC as the only known source capable of meeting this requirement.  This requirement is for 1 base year with four one year options periods.  NASA LaRC and other NASA installations require several network sharable single user workstations to install commercial NASTRAN general-purpose finite-element analysis (FEA) software.  The software will be used to perform structural finite elment analysis.  The program structure will consist of Direct Matrix Abstraction Program (DMAP).  The solution sequences will include nonlinear static, normal modes, nonlinear buckling and static aeroelastic to name a few.	Additional features include complete support of specialized isoparametric membrane and bending plate elements, temperture-dependent composit materials and Lagrange rigid elements.  The software is currently used at 3 NASA centers, Langley, Ames and Kennedy.  This particular software has been used for the past 5 years; therefore, for assurance of compatibility, continuity of current projects, and retrival of archival data, MSC Software Corporation was determined to be the only source capable of supplying the software and services for the NASA centers.	The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12 Noon local time on March 11, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4.1.2 to Mitretek Systems, Inc. for current and future requirements of the Office of Competitive Sourcing Acquisitions (ACA). It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to continue to acquire these services from this contractor on a single source basis.  A contract for one year with a one year option is planned.  The estimated contract value is $1.1M. Mitretek Systems, Inc. will continue to provide critical support services to the FAA.  The services include development of cost models and schedules that meet the  requirements of the Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) procurement. Mitretek, with its unique understanding of FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) and FAA pricing structures has been selected to assist the ACA.  FTI is a critical part of the AFSS operations, equating to approximately $26M in annual costs to the AFSSs. Due to this critical interdependency between the FTI and the AFSS A-76 programs, the FAA has utilized the FTI support vehicle during the past seven months.  During this period, Mitrtek has provided support in the establishment of cost models and schedules designed to best capture the pricing issues of the AFSS Competitive Sourcing Program. Mitretek, through its participation in the current AFSS A-76 effort, combined with its intimate knowledge of FAA‚Äôs Telecommunication Infrastructure (FTI) pricing structures [a fundamental piece of the AFSS services], developed by them, under separate contract, brings unique experience to the AFSS Competitive Sourcing Program, which can  not be severed during the onset of the critical cost activity phases of the AFSS effort.   This critical program support can only be provided through the continuation of the services currently being provided by Mitretek. Therefore, the FAA intends to award a single source contract to Mitretek Systems inc. for continued support to ACA. Inquires may be submitted to the FAA, Attention Donald King, ASU-350, 800 Independence Ave, S.W. Washington D.C. 20591.

By necessity, the Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development efforts are extremely technically diverse.  As such, efforts are divided into six Thrust Areas each representing operational functions critical to Expeditionary Warfare.  Background information and specific areas of interest for new contracts or grants are described below for each Thrust Area.  Mention of specific systems or programs in the background sections of this BAA is solely for the purposes of informing potential offerors of existing or evolving state-of-the-art technology.  The complete BAA is attached to this announcement and is available at the ONR web site www.onr.navy.mil/02/baa.  White papers are due 03 May 2004 and full proposals are due 15 July 2004.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 04-18 Defense against Cyber Attacks on Mobile Ad Hoc Network Systems (DCAMANETS); CLOSING DATE:  01 MAR 05;  FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS:  NOON, Arlington, VA Local Time, 16 April 2004;   POC: Dr. Anup Ghosh, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA04-18@darpa.mil;  Web:  http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/MANETdefense/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencys (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, design, and testing to support the Defense against Cyber Attacks on Mobile Ad Hoc Network Systems (DCAMANETS) program.

The objective of the DCAMANETS program is to develop technologies to automatically and dynamically reconfigure Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)-based systems against cyber attack in order to support successful execution of missions in the face of malicious attacks including computer worms, malicious code, remote cyber intrusions, mobile network infrastructure attacks, and software and hardware run-time failures.  Approaches are expected to build technology to be deployed on network nodes that will sense attacks and failures then dynamically reconfigure the networked system as necessary to successfully achieve mission goals.  The quantitative goals of this program are to (1) dynamically reconfigure the networked system in the face of malicious attacks and failures such that in the worst case a worm spreading over the network is contained to a peak infection proportion of infected machines of 10% of vulnerable machines, (2) false reconfigurations are limited to 10% over normal sessions, (3) good system throughput should not degrade more than 75% on average over the duration of an attack between any two source-destination pairs on the MANET, and (4) network overhead generated by distributed detection devices should not exceed more than 10% of baseline good system throughput during normal conditions in order to assure viability in power-constrained environments.

The DCAMANETS program starts with the premise that next generation Network Centric Warfare (NCW) systems will experience cyber attacks, hardware and software failures that without the availability of dynamic reconfiguration technology will prevent the successful execution of missions.  One of the most severe cyber threats is expected to be worms with arbitrary payload that can infect and saturate MANET-based networks on the order of seconds.  In addition, other attacks against the mobile networking infrastructure, overrun, capture, reverse engineering, and run-time software and hardware failures are expected to impede the ability for distributed applications that run over heterogeneous NCW platforms to successfully execute their missions.  As such, human-required response will be insufficient to counter the threat space and to maintain mission integrity in the face of virulent attacks and failures. 

Proposed solutions are constrained by properties of tactical networks such that: (1) any given node has only partial information about the network at any given time, (2) solutions must utilize the inherently peer-to-peer network topology, (3) there exist no concentration points or bottlenecks through which network traffic can be forced or analyzed, and (4) nodes may coordinate actions, but each node can only enforce control on itself.  

The key research challenges that must be addressed in an integrated solution are: (1) distributed detection of malicious/infected/corrupted nodes from partial observations; (2) dynamic reconfiguration and provisioning of services (e.g., GPS, tracking, common operational picture, threat information) or computational resources via coordinated autonomous operation of nodes ; (3) self-stabilizing behavior within bounded time for dynamic reconfiguration algorithms; (4) distinguishing malicious behavior from legitimate behavior; (5) identifying corrupted components and data to enable automatic reconstitution after attack; and (6) ensuring the cost of the response is much less than the cost of the event. 

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA04-18) on or before 12:00 NOON, Arlington, VA Local Time, 16 April 2004.  

This program will be run at the U.S. SECRET/NOFORN level of classification. A draft program Security Classification Guide (SCG) for this program is available on request and required for guidance on proposal preparation. Performers must have required U.S. personnel clearances, cleared facilities, storage, and processing capabilities to bid on this solicitation as defined in the program SCG. Please see the PIP for important information about proposing on this program as well as details on receiving the draft SCG. The SCG for DCAMANETS is authoritative on all security requirements and guidance. In the event of discrepancies between information presented from this synopsis or the PIP and the SCG, the SCG takes precedence.

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  However, grants will not be issued under this BAA.  The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are, in order of importance: (a) Technical Approach; (b) Multi-Disciplinary Understanding and Approach; (c) Operational Utility; (d) Management Approach & Transition; (e) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA/ATO Mission; and (f) Cost Realism.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the parts of a proposal from proposal respondents.  Proposals may be selected and/or award decisions made without discussions or negotiations.  Additionally, awards may be made without discussions or negotiations.

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated PIP which provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ëmore than 50 percentí for ëat least 80 percentí each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107ñ296.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for an estimated annual quantity of 530 each wet batteries, NSN 6140-01-302-0574, General Motors part number S2000 or Delco Remy part number S2000, or Equal.  The batteries are required in support of the Aircraft Instrument Landing System (ILS).  The North American Industry Classification System code is 335912.  The proposed Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract will include option provisions to renew for four (4) additional one-year periods. This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition limited to small business concerns.  Under normal conditions the ILS is powered by commercial AC electrical power, and the batteries are constantly ‚ÄúFloat‚Äù charged by 27 volts DC with two batteries in series, or 13.5 volts per battery.  Also, the system has ‚ÄúVoltage Foldback‚Äù circuit that limits the battery charging rate to approximately 2 Amps.  In the event of AC power loss, the standby batteries must immediately supply the current (about 7 Amps) to continue the operation of the ILS system for a minimum of six hours.  When commercial power is restored, the batteries will be slowly recharged to their maximum capacity. If offering other than General Motors part number S2000 or Delco Remy part number S2000, the proposed battery must meet the following salient characteristics. Salient Characteristics Per FAA-E-2826 1.2.1(a)		Type-I Lead-Acid batteries, Stationary Standby Float [Automotive ‚Äì type batteries for Stationary Standby systems are specifically prohibited by the National Electrical Code of 1987, article 700-12(a).] 1.2.2(c)		Class-3 Lead-Acid batteries, Sealed, No Maintenance 1.2.3(a)		Style ‚Äì A: Free Electrolyte, or  Orientation or Attitude Sensitive 3.2.1 Battery voltage ‚Äì 12 volts nominal 3.2.2(a)		Battery Capacity ‚Äì 100 Ampere-hour, Deep Cycle 3.2.2(b)		Discharge Rate ‚Äì Must supply 7 Amperes for a minimum of 6 hours 3.2.2(c)	Charge Rate ‚Äì Constant 13.5 Volt floating charge, with charging current limited to a maximum of 2 amperes 3.2.3              Battery Condition ‚Äì Charged and Wet:  Shipped fully charged and ready to use 3.2.3.1              Efficiency ‚Äì When tested for Ampere-hour efficiency, the ratio of Ampere/hours of  	discharge to the Ampere-hours of recharge shall not be less than 85 percent. 3.2.5	Float Charging ‚Äì The battery shall not be damaged by float charging and shall accept float charging. 3.2.6(c)(1)	Life Cycle of Battery ‚Äì 100 cycles total, of which 50 cycles are discharges of from 90% to 100% of specified capacity, 30 cycles are discharges of from 75% to less than 90% of specified capacity, and 20 cycles are discharges of from 40% to less than 75% of specified capacity.

Projects may include highway, transit, passenger rail and intermodal facilities.  Generally, under current law, projects must cost at least $100 million.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on behalf of the DOT, seeks to award multiple financial advisory task order contracts to several qualified firms with project financial analysis expertise in the municipal bond and private lender sectors to assist the DOT in two phases of activity with respect to TIFIA loan applications. The contracts will be for an initial two-year period with three (3) one-year renewal options. -

Phase 1 (Project Evaluation):  Evaluate the soundness and creditworthiness of the applicantís financial plan for the project; and

Phase 2 (Project Negotiation):  As part of a DOT team that includes DOT staff, attorneys and outside counsel, provide support in negotiating the financial terms of credit agreements to be entered into with Borrowers, for those projects selected to receive assistance.

Both phases will involve extensive financial analysis, including, but not limited to, the evaluation of proposed credit structures, calculation of debt service coverage ratios, development of alternative TIFIA debt repayment structures, review of feasibility studies, and provision of computer analysis and modeling support.

The firm must be able to attend working conferences and meetings at DOT headquarters in Washington, D.C. on short notice as well as participate in telephone conference calls on short notice.

It is anticipated that each contractor will be assigned one to three projects (task orders) to evaluate annually, depending upon the level of demand for program assistance.  For each project/task order, DOT will select one firm from among the multiple firms it retains to advise it on each transaction.  Although every project assigned to a contractor will involve the performance of work under Phase 1, the performance of work under Phase 2 will be limited to only those applicants selected by the DOT to receive TIFIA assistance.

<CONTACT>David Lopez Purchasing Agent 5205380414     David_Lopez@nbc.gov;
<DESC>Item 17 - Description of Supplies or Services Title of Effort: "DARPA Financial Systems and Management Administration" Scope of Work: Both the DARPA Comptroller Office (COMP) and Office of Management Operations (OMO) have numerous complex and recurring tasks that are governed by standard operating procedures. The tasks are quite technical and require substantial experience and training to be performed successfully. The Comptroller and Director of OMO are responsible for the staffs that administer these tasks and are often given additional requirements by outside entities (primarily the Office of the Secretary of Defense) and by the Director of DARPA. Given their respective spans of control and competing external and internal taskings, it is extraordinarily difficult for either the Comptroller or the Director of OMO to implement process improvements or provide the necessary training to new employees. In short, what is critically needed is a troubleshooter, an independent consultant who can evaluate ongoing business practices, identify areas of deficiency or inefficiency, and recommend process improvements to streamline procedures and strengthen internal management controls. This individual will also be called upon to perform financial analysis tasks on an as-needed basis, and to train future personnel to quickly and correctly bring these new employees to full capability. Contractor Requirements: Task 1- Financial Management; Task 2 - High Level Financial Management Support; Task 3 - System Analysis and Design; Task 4 - Training. Period of Performance: Will be from contract award for a 1 year base period with 4 one-year optional periods. Security: All classified work up to the level of SECRET will be performed on site at DARPA. Travel: CONUS travel may be required. "See Note 22 below"  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Crosswinds Consulting, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) will make available to interested offerors a request for proposal (RFP) which will transfer the contents of the Cord Blood Banks (CBBs) funded as part of the Cord Blood Transplantation (COBLT) study. The COBLT banking program was initiated in 1996 and conducted under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted Investigational New Drug (IND) application. Umbilical cord blood collections began in December 1997 and were completed by June 2001. During this time over 17,000 cord blood units (CBUs) were collected from consented donors (babyís mother). Over 8,000 of these units were determined an eligible stem cell source for transplantation and placed in the COBLT search registry. Currently over 270 cord blood transplant recipients have received COBLT CBUs as part of the COBLT Study. Data from the study are currently being analyzed. Enrollment in the COBLT Study ended on December 31, 2003 and COBLT CBUs continue to be made available to transplant recipients through the Expanded Access Protocol. This project seeks to provide transplant physicians and their patients continued access to this important stem cell resource by transferring the COBLT CBUs to two (2) acceptable cord blood bank (CBB) programs and listing eligible CBUs in the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry. CBUs, freezers, associated CBU samples, electronic data bases, computer software, and source documentation will be provided to the successful contractors. Currently, the contents of the COBLT CBBs are located at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC), Durham, North Carolina, and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), California. Approximately 4000 eligible CBUs are stored at each location.  Of note, no funds to maintain or operate the new bank program will be provided. Costs for relocation of the COBLT CBBs will be supported by the NHLBI under the existing contracts. It is anticipated that two (2) no-cost contract awards with a fixed-price of $0 and a performance period of ten (10) years will be made from this solicitation. This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The RFP will be made available electronically on or about March  17, 2004 at the following website: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#nhlbi

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a temperature and pressure controller system capable of controlling the high temperatures and pressures needed to study planetary materials under pressures equivalent to the deep interiors of planets, asteroids and the Moon.	NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Rockland Research Corp. The Rockland Research temperature and pressure controller system (DV-TC and MA-PCS) is uniquely designed to work with our system for several reasons.  First, the temperature control system uses a 48/12 Volt transformer step down configuration that is unavailable from other companies.  This capability will allow research to be carried out with both graphite and Re foil furnaces (12 Volt) as well as lanthanum chromite furnaces (48 volt).  Second, the pressure control system allows the user to gradually ramp pressure from ambient conditions to run conditions, as well as back down, both at very slow ramp rates that are necessary to maintain the integrity and lifetime of the tungsten carbide pressure anvils.  The temperature and pressure controllers (DV-TC and MA-PCS) from Rockland Research Corp. is the only instrument that NASA found to be acceptable and meet all requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 12, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service intends to issue a Solicitation for the operation of a Mail Transportation Equipment Service Center (MTESC) to be located in the Cleveland, Ohio area.  Specific Facility location requirements will be posted with the solicitation.  It is expected that the Solicitation will be issued by Friday, March 5, 2004.

The purpose of the Mail Transport Equipment (MTE) network is to ensure an adequate supply of
high-quality MTE ready for rapid deployment to Postal facilities and their customers.
MTESCs will receive MTE, examine it, and route it for reuse if serviceable, repair it if defective
but repairable, or dispose of it if beyond repair. (Disposal may be through waste pickup or
material recycling and will be directed by the Postal Service.) Each MTESC in the network will
be responsible for processing and repairing MTE for use by Postal facilities and commercial
mailers.
The MTE network will provide an efficient means of continuously improving the management of
MTE processing, repair, and distribution functions. Other benefits expected from the MTE
network include better MTE performance and life cycle data and improved control over the
disposal of condemned MTE. The MTE network will also allow Postal Service Area and
Headquarters staff to continuously balance MTE inventories within and among all Postal Service
Areas both effectively and efficiently.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Robert Williams, 816-983-3843
<DESC>The project includes the straightening of the channel from the downstream end of the existing Paseo Channel Project, through Woodland Avenue and tying into the water control structure built for the Woodland Avenue Emergency Repair Project. (The City of Kansas City, Missouri executed the emergency repair in 1999.)   The Woodland reach is approximately 700 feet in length and includes one dam/drop structure.  The new work will tie into the existing upstream reach construction.  Some retaining walls and slope paving will require removal to allow for realignment of the ch annel. The project consists of lowering the channel bottom approximately three feet on average from the termination of the Paseo Channel Project, through a drop structure near station 140+00, and until tying into the invert established by the emergency repair of 1999.  Excavation will mainly be in Bethany Falls Limestone through the reach in the channel, and overburden on the side slopes. A significant amount of overburden in the Woodland reach was removed during the Paseo Project.  The channel walls will be struc tural reinforced concrete walls.  Where the rock does not project high enough, structural walls will be constructed to facilitate grading along the channel. A dam (referred to as the Woodland Dam) will be located about 500 feet upstream of the former Woodland Avenue Bridge, with a crest el evation of 784 msl. A drop structure will be constructed downstream of the dam which will lower the channel elevation 6 feet over a 200 foot length of channel. Downstream of the Woodland Dam and drop structure, the channel will transition back into the exi sting channel with some modifications at a water control structure near Station 145+00. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. A pre-bid conference/site visit is scheduled.  Estimated time of completion:  150 days from Notice To Proceed.   Solicitation is web based and will be available on or about 19 March 2004.  Registration will be required to download the solicitation and any amendments at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District website at http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/co ntract/contract.html.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about the first week in February 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer three weeks thereafter.

AWARD INFORMATION
All awards will be subject to the availability of Government funds.  Funds may not be currently available for all topics under this BAA.  No award will be made for a topic until appropriated funds are available from which payment for award purposes can be made.  The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  The Government anticipates multiple awards. The Government desires to award the optimum combination of proposals, which offers the best overall value to the Government. DARPA reserves the right to fund some, all, or none of the proposals submitted under this BAA and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  IPTO anticipates that much of the resulting research will be in the form of small-scale studies.

Proposals or abstracts that are not within the topical areas described in the Proposerís Information Pamphlet (PIP) for BAA 02-21 may be considered out of scope and not evaluated. Likewise, proposals or abstracts that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development may also be considered out of scope and may not be evaluated. 

SPECIAL FOCUS AREAS
From time to time, DARPA will publish addenda to this BAA that will highlight particular areas of interest. It is highly recommended that potential proposers look periodically for these updates.  DARPA will not establish a distribution list for automatic distribution of these addenda.

ELIGIBILITY
This BAA solicits proposals from all interested and qualified sources. Foreign participants and/or individuals may participate to the extent that such participants comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 is being issued to release the Draft Performance Work Statement for public comment for the Electronics Technician (ET) Services of the Marine Operations Centers (MOC).  NOAA is conducting a standard competition in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003. This A-76 cost comparison study will examine the possibility of converting Government "in-house" operations to contractor operations. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the following services and related functions performed by Government personnel to contract performance will be conducted. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. Nationwide, approximately 37 Full Time Equivalent ET positions and two FTE of Administrative Support positions are affected by this competition.

The competition will include services that are currently performed by Government personnel at sea aboard NOAA vessels and in various NMAO Marine Operations Center locations including, but not limited to, Norfolk, VA; Seattle, WA; Honolulu, HI; Pascagoula, MS; and Woods Hole, MA. Services being competed include preventive and corrective maintenance and installations on all the various types of electronic equipment and systems used on NOAA Hydrographic Survey and Fisheries and Oceanographic research ships. Typical functions to be performed include assessing maintenance requirements and determining resources required to repair and/or install equipment; preparing service reports and installation plans; repairing equipment using schematics, vendor documents and test equipment; and verifying repair or performing acceptance tests of returned/repaired equipment; configuring, operating and administering the NOAA Scientific Computer System (SCS) and email servers. The systems include, but are not limited to: navigation systems, acoustic systems, communications systems, oceanographic/ atmospheric instruments, personal computers, network servers and local area network components. 

The Acting Competitive Sourcing Official for NOAA/NMAO study is Helen Hurcombe.   Capt John Clary is the Agency Tender Official. The Contracting Officer is Joel Perlroth.

In accordance with OMB Circular A-76, the U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration will be issuing a Request for Proposal for shipboard and shore side electronics technician services. Full details of the work requirements will be in the Performance Work Statement included as part of the solicitation. In accordance with OMB Circular A-76, it is anticipated that a Phased Evaluation Source Selection process will be used. The NAICS Code is 811212, 811213, and 811219.  As a result of this study it is the Government's intent to award a service provider agreement (contract, fee-for-service or letter of obligation) with a base period of one year and four 12-month option periods and three additional 12-month award term periods. This solicitation will not result in a contract if Government performance is determined to be more advantageous. The anticipated solicitation release date is May 3, 2004. The anticipated due date for proposals is June 25, 2004. The solicitation will be available solely through the Federal Business Opportunities website. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be available. All questions must be directed to Joel Perlroth, Contracting Officer in writing via e-mail at eed.a76@noaa.gov 

NO TELEPHONIC questions will be accepted.  It is the responsibility of all prospective providers to review this site frequently for updates to any and all documents.  The projected end date (Performance Decision) of this competition is on or before September 30, 2004.

Small and small disadvantaged firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law  95-507.

Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract, the Corps of Engineers target goals for subcontracting are 57.2% to small business concerns; 10.0% to small disadvantaged business concerns; 10.0% to women-owned small business concerns; 3.0% for HUBZone certified concerns; and 3.0% to service -disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.  Large firms should keep these target goals in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure that the socio-economic status  of each proposed subcontractor is clearly identified  in the submission of qualifications.  An approved small business subcontracting plan will be required prior to award to a large business firm. The NAICS code is 541330, with a small business size standard of four million dollars.

All items shall be delivered within 120 calendar days from issuance of delivery order and shall be delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center, 2401 Hawkins Point Rd., Baltimore, MD 21226-5000.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered.  Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to the spare parts are not available within the Government and are proprietary to Cummins Engine Co.  Accordingly, it is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center from obtaining competition as the parts are available from Cummins Engine Co. and/or their authorized distributors.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capabilities to supply the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The procurement involves the parts being procured from Cummins Engine Co. and/or their authorized distributors.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities as follows:  (i.e. salient physical function and serviceability, characteristics) (1) show that parts have satisfactorily manufactured the part for the Government or the prime equipment manufacturer; or (2) submit complete and current engineering data comparing the offered parts to the OEMís to determine the acceptability of the parts.  It is the Governmentís belief that only Cummins Engine Co and/or their authorized distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required complete information discussing capabilities are invited to submit complete information discussing capabilities in duplicate within 15 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing information is required.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited.  Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements.  Adequate detail data by which to evaluate capabilities should be sent to the attention of Sharon Jackson, Contract Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center, 2401 Hawkins Point Rd., Mail Stop 99, Baltimore, MD 21226-5000.

<DESC>NOTICE TO SUPPLIERS

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The United States Postal Service is seeking companies or firms that can furnish, implement, and assist in executing an Indefinite Quantity Contract / Job Order Contracting (IQC/JOC) automated system. The main objective of the system would be to enable the Postal Service to rapidly engage contractors to perform construction (repairs and alterations) and construction related services.  Achieving timely and cost effective procurement of maintenance and construction services is one of the most difficult and challenging facility related tasks facing the Postal Service. Complying with the standard procurement regulations required for traditional construction services contracts, combined with the necessary technical component of defining the requirements (i.e., architectural and engineering drawings and specifications) for seeking proposals makes it difficult to be responsive to facility users in a timely manner. This has created a need for the Postal Service to have a more responsive contracting technique for the accomplishment of maintenance, repair and minor construction projects. The Contractors shall develop and maintain a Catalog or Unit Price Book that contains individual construction tasks for all aspects of maintenance, repair and construction of facilities, roads, parking lots, security requirements, USPS specific items, and many other related components (CSI 16 Divisions). The Contractor shall further provide training and support to the Postal Service personnel and contractors for the implementation and success of the IQC/JOC system for the USPS. This system would be implemented nationwide.

SCOPE OF WORK AND SERVICES

1.	CONTRACTOR will provide experienced staff that will be responsible for the IQC/JOC development and implementation program.  This staff will report directly to USPS and will be available to assist USPS with any IQC/JOC related issues.  

2.	CONTRACTOR will be responsible for the development of IQC/JOC documents including the unit price book for each geographical area covered, based on  the USA counties involved, for each contract issued by the USPS, technical specifications, drawings and assist in developing the contract terms and conditions and proposal documents.

CONTRACTOR must currently have and manage an internet based, automated IQC/JOC type proposal system, which is capable of generating the IQC/JOC documents including contractor cost proposals, cost estimates and other management reports and forms. The system must utilize secure logins for each user that controls access to all of the systemís features. The system must manage each geographical area independent of other geographical areas but have the ability to view and report on all geographical areas in real time. The system would enable the USPS contractors to generate electronic versions of their cost proposals (and other associated data) for submission to the USPS. The system would enable USPS generated independent cost estimates, detailed scopes of work, review and validate cost proposals (and other tasks associated with issuing work orders) ELECTRONICALLY. The use of the electronic data is intended to be a time and cost savings tool for all parties within this program. In addition it would allow the USPS and the contractors to perform a variety of project management tasks electronically. Included in the system will be the ability to generate management reports for use by the contractor and the USPS. The use of the electronic data is intended to be a time and cost savings tool for all parties within this program.  Technical Support - A major component of the proposed system should include Technical Support. Expectations would include assisting the USPS in execution procedures, troubleshooting, implementation, and continuous system monitoring.  Technical support is considered to be on going management support for the operational system.



4.	CONTRACTOR will be responsible for providing access to the system for both USPS and IQC/JOC contractors.  Client will have no restrictions on the number of users on the systems installations (nationwide).  

5.	CONTRACTOR will be responsible for testing/debugging the system under actual field conditions prior to the implementation of IQC/JOC at any USPS or contractor site.

6.

	ï	Prepare and Conduct Pre-Proposal Meetings,
	ï	Prepare and Conduct an External Marketing Program,
	ï	Prepare and Conduct an Internal Marketing Program, and
	ï	Coordinate and Develop the IQC/JOC Execution Procedures.

7.	CONTRACTOR will be responsible for furnishing a comprehensive IQC/JOC training program. Training is essential to ensure that the IQC/JOC system functions properly. As part of the requirements, the contractor must have developed specialized training courses that would involve all parties utilizing the system  this may include: purchasing staff, field staff, engineers, clerical administrative staff and the USPS contractors.  All aspects of the system are to be covered in the training. This must include but not be limited to the following: IQC/JOC execution, implementing procedures, system training, post implementation follow up, refreshers as needed.

<DESC>Notice to Suppliers

Request for Information

The USPS is considering negotiating a Two Phased Construction Cost Reimbursable contract to build a Vehicle Maintenance Facility (VMF) and a Storage Facility in Philadelphia, PA, to JE Dunn Construction. The estimated cost of this project is $10,000,000. As part of this consideration, the USPS is seeking comments from contractors, subcontractors, suppliers and other interested parties regarding the proposed action.

Background: After a significant planning and design effort, The USPS awarded in 2003 a contract to JE Dunn for the construction of the Philadelphia Processing and Distribution Plant. (P&DC)  This is a 910,000 square foot facility designed to deal with existing space deficiencies and to improve mail processing in the Philadelphia area. The original plan called for having a VMF on the site of the P&DC but due to operational changes that affected the building footprint and parking, the VMF was removed from the project prior to contract award. Subsequently, the USPS acquired a new site adjacent to the P&DC site and it is now prepared to build this facility.

Proposed Action: The USPS is considering foregoing prequalification and the competitive award process and negotiating a contract to build this project with JE Dunn Construction for the following reasons:

1-JE Dunn is highly qualified to complete this project. JE Dunn was originally prequalified and won the contract for the P&DC facility competitively when it included the VMF.
2-Because JE Dunn has and advantage due to his superior knowledge of this project and because of having resources on an adjacent site (personnel that can be use to support both the P&DC and VMF project) it is most likely that they would succeed in getting this project in a competitive process.
3- Because the proposed contract is a cost reimbursable construction contract where all subcontractor bids over $50,000 are subject to competition, the USPS estimates that over 85% of the contract value will be subject this competition. Even with a negotiated contract the USPS will derive the benefit of competitive pricing for most of the cost of the project.
4- Negotiating the VMF contract will save the USPS the time and costs associated with the normal prequalification process, Request for Proposals solicitation, and award of this contract. 
5- Because the VMF and P&DC must be completed concurrently and because they are operationally related, having the same company complete both projects will help with coordinating the completion, acceptance and move in of postal operations. 
6- The USPS is reluctant to submit the contracting community to all the considerable expenses associated with a competitive process (prequalification, solicitation, oral presentations, etc) when one of the suppliers has an apparent and distinct competitive advantage by virtue of previous experience with this project and when a competitive process is not likely to yield appreciable benefits to the USPS
 
Accordingly, it appears it is in the best interest to negotiate a contract with JE Dunn for the construction of the Philadelphia VMF. The USPS is seeking comments from the building contracting community and other interested parties regarding this approach before making a final decision to contract with JE Dunn.  Comments should be sent to the USPS not later than March 18, 2004. All comments should be directed to:

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  The Marine Corps has a Mission Need Statement for a Family of Artillery Munitions.  The Portable Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (PIAFS) is required to set the Multi Option Fuze Artillery (MOFA) fuze and will meet Marine Corps requirements for an inductive fuze setting capability.  It will replace existing manual fuze setter wrenches in the inventory and will be employed by Marine Corps 155mm howitzer crews.  The PIAFS is currently the only man-portable, inductive fuze setter planned in the inventory.  The PIAFS is a mission essential item of equipment.  It will permit inductive (electromagnetic) transfer of fuze setting information independently or from the Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155) Digital Fire Control System (DFCS) to all inductive fuzes including the M762, M767, and M773 fuzes.  The PIAFS inductive settings are designed to improve the howitzer sections ability to quickly and accurately set artillery fuzes, decrease fire mission response time, and reduce human errors associated with manual settings.  The PIAFS consists of two basic components: the hand held PIAFS device and its internal / external power source.  It is powered by replaceable internal batteries and includes a liquid crystal display (LCD) that indicates the fuze setting functions selected, and confirmation that the fuze has been properly set.  After inductively setting fuzes, PIAFS will provide fuze setting data feedback to the user.  The PIAFS shall be produced in accordance with government provided performance specifications.  The US Army has procured and will soon field PIAFS.  The Armyís detailed specification and drawing package are available for reference as Government Furnished Information (GFI).  The PIAFS produced under this contract shall be compatible with all US Army logistics to include training, compatibility, form, fit and function.  The Marine Corps System Command intends to compete a Full and Open Firm Fixed Price Contract for the procurement of approximately 400 PIAFS.  The base contract may require the vendor to produce approximately 10 PIAFS for government testing activities, conduct First Article Testing, and prepare for Full Rate Production by completing a production readiness review.  The contract will include a production option for approximately 400 PIAFS.  The following schedule has been established and must be achievable by interested vendors.  Award Contract ñ June 2004; Produce PIAFS Test Articles (approximately 10) ñ NLT 15 November 2004; Complete First Article Testing ñ NLT 23 December 2004; Exercise production option ñ NLT 1 March 2005; Complete Full Rate Production ñ NLT 23 December 2005.  Industry firms capable of accomplishing the required services are invited to submit a response to this notice.  Firms should identify/submit a copy of their GSA schedule, if applicable.  Firms should also include literature, brochures, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.  A prototype PIAFS will be requested from all interested vendors as part of their proposal.  The prototype will be returned when source selection is completed.  This deliverable will be at the expense of the bidder.  Interested firms are requested to respond NLT 17 March 2004, stating their business size, NAICS Code, and identifying a corporate point of contact.  Interested sources should respond to:  Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN PG 14, Attn: Anita Norris, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to establish Qualified Bidders List

Point of Contact: Brant Petrick 202-208-4673 fpki.webmaster@gsa.gov

Description:  Under the authority of FAR Subpart 9.2 it is the intent of the Federal Identity Credentialing Committee to establish a Qualified Bidders List of entities providing PKI services that 1) meet the X.509 Certificate Policy for the Common Policy Framework and 2) can demonstrate the ability to place and use certificates on smart-cards under the Government Smart Card Interoperability Specification Version 2.1.  

Pursuant to its responsibilities under the Electronic Government Act of 2002, OMB has determined that beginning in FY 2006, absent unusual requirements, Federal Agencies that intend to use PKI services will be buying PKI services from qualified managed service providers operating under the Federal Common Policy Framework rather than establishing their own internal PKI.  Agencies with PKI operations that are cross-certified with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority will not be required to migrate to these new managed service providers, but as time goes on it may become desirable to migrate to these new providers.   It is the expectation of the Federal Identity Credentialing Committee that this two step process will result in cost savings to both industry and government; first by insuring that PKI services are developed to meet a common policy, rather than having each agency developing its own idiosyncratic policy, and secondly by having a common contract against which task and delivery orders may be placed by federal agencies (and other authorized users of GSA Schedules.)

The first step will be conducted by the Federal Identity Credentialing Committee to determine whether or not companies providing commercial PKI services can do so meeting the requirements of the Common Policy Framework X.509 Common Policy.  After this is determined, the companies will be invited to demonstrate the capability of placing and using their PKI certificates on smart cards that meet the Government Smart Card Interoperability Specification (Version 2.1).  Once these capabilities are successfully demonstrated, the company will be placed on the Qualified Bidders List for the Common Policy Framework.  It is anticipated that the first round of vendors will be placed on the list no later than June 30, 2004.  To facilitate this, companies should submit their information to the FICC no later than April 15, 2004.  Thereafter, the Federal Identity Credentialing Committee will evaluate other companies on a rolling open season.  The Qualified Bidders List will remain in effect for five years, after which GSA will re-evaluate whether continuation of the list is necessary or desirable. 

The GSA Federal Supply Service will conduct the second step.  Companies on the Qualified Bidders List will be invited to submit proposals for newly established Special Item Numbers (SINs) on the Group 70 Schedule.  

Entities that are placed on the Qualified Bidders List and already provide PKI services under a GSA Schedule Contract or other GWAC will not be required to obtain another contract to deliver services, but depending upon the scope of the existing contract, contract modifications may be necessary to provide a complete solution under the Federal Common Policy.  If the necessary contract modifications exceed the scope of the already awarded contract, the companies will be invited to submit a Group 70 Schedule proposal.

An Industry Day to address questions from potential bidders will be held on March 11, 2004 at the GSA Central Office Auditorium, 1800 F Street, NW, Washington DC, beginning at 9:00am.  Please visit the website at http://www.cio.gov/ficc/pki.htm for directions and to register for the Industry Day.

Detailed Information:  The Federal Identity Credentialing Committee Shared Service Provider web page <<http://www.cio.gov/ficc/ssp_documents.htm>> has documents of interest to companies desiring to be placed on the Qualified Bidder's list, including, but not limited to:

∑	Shared Service Provider Roadmap: Navigating the Process to Acceptance

<DESC>The Department of Education intends to make a sole source award to the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, for the 2006 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS 2006).    PIRLS 2006 will be the second in a series of international reading literacy assessments designed to compare and contrast the performance of fourth-grade students in over 40 countries.  

The IEA will be tasked with coordinating and carrying out the activities associated with this large-scale international assessment.  As part of these duties, the IEA is required to produce the data collection materials including all data collection instruments (assessment booklets, background questionnaires) and administration documents (e.g., test administration manuals, quality assurance manual) necessary to successfully carry out the project.  In addition, the IEA will be required to produce several products after the main data collection including a report on the findings of the study, a report outlining the technical aspects of the study, and an international version of the database accessible to researchers and other parties interested in secondary research.

It is imperative that the contractor has the following competencies, experiences, and skills:

A) access to the secured items used in the prior iteration of PIRLS;  B) familiarity and extensive experience with conducting large-scale international reading literacy assessments; C) proven record in conducting similar studies in a timely manner, and within budget; D) experience in large-scale data cleaning, scoring and coding; E) familiarity with creating large-scale databases of assessment information in concert with NCES' confidentiality standards for human subjects; F) experience in finding qualified translators to verify translations of all assessment items, questionnaires and other materials into multiple foreign languages; G) ability to gather experts from numerous disciplines to aid in the oversight of the study; and, H) ability to assist NCES in making the results of the study relevant to teachers, teacher educators, parents, and policy makers.

The IEA is uniquely qualified to address each of the above stated needs for the study.  Having directed PIRLS 2001, as well as assessments focused on mathematics and science (TIMSS 1995, 1999, and 2003), the IEA possess a knowledge of the machinations of the study and its country participants that is unmatched by any other academic or research institution. Most importantly, the IEA holds copyright to the instruments that have been used in the past iteration of PIRLS, and that will be used in PIRLS 2006, making it the only possible source for obtaining the information gained from PIRLS.  In sum, the expertise and experience of the staff of the IEA and the International Study Center, as well as copyright to the PIRLS instruments, make them uniquely qualified to collect, analyze, and present the results of an international study of this importance and scope.

All interested parties should submit a letter of interest to the contact person by the closing date in this notice.  The Department will afford interested parties an opportunity to submit capability statements outlining experience directly relevant to this requirement.  If any other capable, responsible sources are found, this procurement will be opened for full and open competition.

Exciting Topics:
The Small Business Trade Conference opens Apr. 28th and includes a day crammed with informative sessions. This year's hot new topics include Department of Homeland Security and Doing Business with the Defense Supply Center Columbus just to name a few. Other topics brought back by popular demand are sorting out G.S.A. Schedules and Taking the Mystery Out of Doing Business with the Government. From certifying your small business to making your product more marketable, we will help you arm your business with critical information ensuring greater success.

Taking it to a Higher Level:

On Thurs. Apr. 29th, we offer opportunities to develop and build strategic supplier relationships. Representatives from all layers of governmental agencies will be on hand to speak with attendees. Large corporations looking for qualified small businesses will also be available to speak about partnerships and business opportunities.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation DTCG85-04-Q-625518AK for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and quotations are being requested.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.    The NAICS is 721110.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesterís concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencyís goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award of a contract will be based on the following criteria:  Past Performance and price.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions.  Therefore, offerorís initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-19 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20040113.  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 8221 and the size standard is $6,000,000.  NAICS is 611310.
This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures (The award will be less than $100,000) will be followed.  This purchase will be for one Infrared/Visible Signature Suppression (IR-103) Training Course from 6 Apr 04 to 8 Apr 04 in accordance with the following Statement of Work (SOW).   
1.0	     INTRODUCTION

This Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the requirements for an Infrared/Visible Signature Suppression course in support of the AFFTC/EWA Engineering Assessment Division at Edwards Air Force Base, CA.

1.1	Scope

The contractor shall provide selected students from the AFFTC/EWA Engineering Assessment Division, Edwards Air Force Base, CA with an Infrared/Visible Signature Suppression course to specifically provide specialized knowledge of low observable techniques for scientists and engineers.

2.0	      APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS

No documents apply to the required Infrared/Visible Signature Suppression course.

3.0       REQUIREMENTS

3.1	General

The contractor shall provide formal training on Infrared/Visible Signature Suppression techniques and methods for scientists and engineers.  The training will culminate in an understanding of these techniques and methods for scientists and engineers. 
 
The technical services provided by the contractor will include a three-day Infrared/Visible Signature Suppression course designed to satisfy the demands for engineers and scientists who require specialized knowledge of low observable techniques.  Classroom academics shall be tailored to prepare the students to better perform their flight-testing duties.  The course should also benefit those who already have some knowledge and experience in low observables.  The objective of this course will be to present a clear and cohesive picture of infrared and visible stealth techniques, describe their limitations and integration problems, provide an assessment of their effectiveness, discuss new technologies in development, and compare the merits of signature control with other survivability techniques at Edwards Air Force Base. 

No formal prerequisites will be required for admission into this Infrared/Visible Signature Suppression course.  However, the course will focus toward, and will more directly benefit, individuals who need specialized knowledge of low observable techniques. Familiarity with infrared techniques is assumed, such as that obtained from attending the Georgia Tech Infrared Technology and Applications four-day introductory course.  However, the latter course is not a prerequisite, and one should expect to receive some benefit from the course without much prior infrared experience.

Garmin Avionics was selected for the following safety reasons:
The Garmin Avionics system enhances the safety of passengers and crew by allowing the display of information within easy sight of the pilots. Presently, the navigation, communication and Art Traffic Control selectors and information are placed to the center and rear of the cockpit. This forces the pilots to have to turn around and situate their heads in such a way that normally leads to vertigo or loss of spatial awareness. This loss of awareness has been a contributing factor in aircraft mishaps. This will enhance the safety of the passengers and crew by relocating the navigation, Radio communications and Air Traffic control transponder from the lower console between the pilots to the instrument panel. This will allow the pilots to operate their navigation and communications radios without having to look away to change frequencies.
The Garmin system has a color-moving map with detailed and high quality definition of man made obstacles, terrain features and Air Traffic control designated airspace. This display allows for continuous situational awareness. This feature is very important since our mission profile takes us from high-density large airports to small remote unfamiliar airfields within the same flight.
The Garmin system was selected due to the fact that it is the only one of its type and size that will provide all systems to be relocated to the instrument panel due to the lack of available space to accommodate additional systems.
The Garmin system combines GPS navigation, VHF communication, VHF navigation and color moving map into one digital unit.
Equipment removed from the aircraft will be returned to US Government (USASOC Flight Detachment.)
If the offeror wishes to propose avionics other than Garmin, sufficient information must be provided to allow for evaluation of the features of the proposed equipment. 
The offeror shall include information regarding scheduling, performance time and lead time on this requirement.
The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial; 52-212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items apply to this requirement; DFARS 252.212.7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items apply to this requirement.  The clauses at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items; DFARS 252.212.7001, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items apply to this requirement.  Additionally, within FAR 52.212-5 the following clauses are applicable:  52.203-6 AI, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222.36, 52.222.37, 52.225-3, 52,225-9, 52.225-18, 52.225-19, 52.225-21, 52.247-64 apply.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Air National Guard must support the MS by providing forces that possess certain capabilities, and employ the forces in joint military operations.  We must train the way we fight; knowi ng the tasks that are required to exploit our capabilities.  We must develop performance and training processes and procedures to support the intent and effectiveness of Joint Force readiness and establish ways to measure performance to assess how well mis sion essential tasks are being accomplished.  The intent of training is to ensure organizations are trained to operate successfully in the full spectrum of conflict. The five tenets of joint training include:  Use of Joint doctrine, Commanders as the prima ry trainers, Mission focus, Train the way you intend to fight and Centralize planning with decentralized execution.  Each ANG organization requires a unique Mission Essential Task Listing (METL) illustrating its commitment to the success of its assigned mi ssions. As such, the METL is the complete package of mission essential tasks (MET) for any particular organization. It is identified through an analysis of an assigned or anticipated mission and demands a detailed analysis of mission  capabilities/requirem ents, as well as, a definition of tasks/relationships to the Air Force Task List (AFTL), Joint Mission Essential Task List (JMETL), and the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL).  Additionally, relevant conditions (perform this task under conditions of√¢¬Ä¬¶..)  that affect the performance of each individual task within the appropriate environment must also be identified and developed for each ANG organization.   This effort will support the Chief, National Guard Bureau and the Director, Air National Guard√¢¬Ä¬ôs  vision and strategy of √¢¬Ä¬úReady, Reliable, and Relevant√¢¬Ä¬¶Now√¢¬Ä¬¶and in the future√¢¬Ä¬ù to meet the challenges of Air Force and DoD Transformation, Jointness and capabilities-based relevance.  OBJECTIVE :  The objectives of this effort are:  To c onduct a thorough analytical examination of ANG UTCs, mission capability requirements, and assigned missions.  Analyze applicable UJTLs, JMETLs, and AFTLs for application within the ANG.  Formulate an ANG strategy, concept, and policy for METs that will en hance the combat effectiveness and interoperability.Develop standardize and objective METL for all assigned organizations to include conditions, performance measures, and standards.  TASKS - The required tasks include:  Developing detailed CONOPS with appl icable doctrine and policy, outline of specific tasks and milestones.  Reviewing, analyzing, and documenting UTCs and missions of all assigned ANG organizations.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is changed from small business set-aside to full and open competition for DTCG85-04-Q-625370 commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  The NAICS Code is 333612.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesterís concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencyís goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
