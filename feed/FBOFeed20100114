NAMSA has been authorized to use the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure. It is anticipated that this project will be incorporated into one contract.

The rough cost estimate for this project is Euro 40 – 50 million. The U.S. Department of Commerce reference for the Invitation for Bid (IFB) is IFB-ISAF-CUR-304 and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number. 

IMPORTANT: Classified information will be provided with the tender.  The U.S. Government will nominate to the bidders list U.S. facilities that 1) have been approved for participation in NATO ICB, 2) have documented successful completion of similar projects as primary contractors, and 3) hold a current Facility Security Clearance (FCL). 

The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications needed for performance of the contract.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION

The project consist of earth and landscaping works; demolition and relocation of existing structures (roads and utilities); road works (asphalted surfaces); complete reinforced concrete building construction, including technical installations (heating, A/C, ventilation, electricity); power generators; power distribution; storm water drainage; sewage; water distribution; parking areas and hardstands.

The contractor’s experience with the construction of reinforced concrete structures and roads in Afghanistan or Iraq is considered an essential requirement.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for an ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States. 

U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.  The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

Using the contact information indicated on the DOE, the NATO contracting agency will contact the firm when the IFB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a DOE (and, for U.S. facilities not yet approved for NATO ICB, to submit a completed NATO ICB application): 27 January 2010

2. Anticipated IFB release date: 17 February 2010

3. Anticipated bid closing date: 20 April 2010

4. Anticipated contract award date: 05 May 2010

<DESC>This modification is being issued as pending the availability of funds. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to negotiate and award a modification to contract HHSM-500-2009-00037C for the continued performance of EHR efforts as mandated by legislation stated below. The estimated cost of this modification is $2,400,000.
<p>On February 13th 2009, the House of Representatives and Senate approved the conference report for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. TITLE XXX of ARRA is related to HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND QUALITY. <br />PART 2 of TITLE XXX of ARRA is related to "APPLICATION AND USE OF ADOPTED HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.</p>
<p>Subtitle A - Medicare Incentives ~ Sec. 4102 "Incentives for Hospitals". This section provides financial incentives beginning with 2011 for eligible subsection (d) hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) that are meaningful EHR users, followed by financial penalties beginning in 2015 for eligible hospitals who are not meaningful EHR users.<br />An eligible hospital that is a meaningful EHR provider could receive up to four years of financial incentives, beginning with fiscal year 2011. There will be no payments for EHR adoption that begins after 2015.</p>
<p>As stated in ARRA legislation each agency must promote the usage of Health Information Technology Systems and Products that meet EHR standards. Currently, the method of collection of data for quality reporting is via a tool and abstracted data. This method must change to adopt the Electronic Health Record (EHR). This project will allow testing of the first 3 measure sets (out of 16 measures in total) that Healthcare Information Technology Standard Panel (HITSP) has specified in Quality Reporting Data Architecture QRDA format.</p>
<p>In July 2009 CMS awarded a sole-source contract to the Iowa Foundation for Medical Care for the continued maintenance and operations of the Physician's Quality Reporting Initiative in accordance with the expanded legislation. (See posting dated July 15, 2009)</p>
<p>During this period testing was conducted utilizing EHR. Steps were performed that included vetting, self nomination, authentication/authorization, submission applications, submission databases, EHR datawarehouse and test data.</p>
<p>Due to their current experience with EHR and their ability to build on an existing platform thereby reducing the repetition of existing requirements and the time necessary for implementation, CMS intends to award a modification to the IFMC for the continued expansion of the EHR, pending the availability of funds. Due to the uncertainty of the future requirements, CMS will award a cost plus fixed-fee line item modification to the current HHSM-500-2009-00037C contract.</p>
<p><br />The increase in funding shall not exceed $2,400,000 and the contract shall remain within the posted ceiling of $48,000,000 (total for base and one option year)</p>

US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with the Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS), for nine (9) Quintas Prolog Software Licenses, Maintenance Support for Quintas Prolog Runtime Generator, and Maintenance Support for SICStus Prolog 4.0 Commercial (ten (10)-user site licenses) for three (3) supported computing platforms from, previously purchased from SICS.  Quintas and SICS Prolog Software is proprietary and not available from any other source.  Other languages have been tried without success at replacing PROLOG at TASPO.

***Sole Source determination is based on CBP’s requirement for licenses and maintenance for the 32-bit word size Quintas and 64-bit word size SICS Prolog language, in which the Targeting rules engine are written in.  Prolog is the logic programming language currently used in three separate US Customs applications, ATS-AT, ATS-N, and ATS-P, and it performs rule-based evaluations of electronically filed information pertaining to import and export cargo as well as flight data.  Access includes the most robust 24/7 support that the ATS applications need.  Due to the constantly increasing volume of shipments and sophistication of the algorithms used by TASPO, the hardware is being updated and the therefore the capacity must be increased from 32-bit to 64-bit word size, so during the transition period, both are required. The targeting applications are run on a 24/7 basis.  If this exact software is not used, then the Targeting rule manager will have to be rewritten at considerable cost, or else the targeting engine will be at risk for production errors. 

***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Washington, DC, and is required within 30 days after receipt of order.

***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511.

**The Government intends to solicit and negotiate directly with Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS).    No solicitation package will be issued.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.     The statement of capabilities must be submitted in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can perform the requirement.     A determination to compete this action based on the responses received is in the sole discretion of the Government.     All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities via email.  Verifications of receipt of responses are the sole responsibility of the contractor.     If no responsive statements are received by January 20, 2010 at 3:00 pm EST, an award shall be made to the Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS).

As these articles are published by the Royal Society of Chemistry and proprietary rights to all articles they publish, the Royal Society is the only source that can provide these required archives to expand the existing library. 

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD.  Delivery is required within 45 days after receipt of order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 519120, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by January 29, 2010.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The Physics Department at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), Monterey, CA has a requirement for the fabrication, testing and delivery of the chips resulting from six (6) Silicon-Insulator-Silicon (SIO) wafer starts based on NPS' wafer design specifications using customized MEMS processes previously fabricated by Santa Barbara Tool and Die.  The wafer starts are the second generation or logical follow-on of the Government's requirements for wafer starts previously fabricated under N00244-09-P-0599.

IMT has a unique proprietary process dealing with the SOI layers which meets the Government's stringent field emission and voltage requirement and in which the second generation of wafer starts evolves and is now required.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.
The purpose of this synopsis is to notify potential offerors of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management's (OAM's) intent to issue a solicitation to provide Quality Assurance Technical Support (QATS) services for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER), Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI), Analytical Services Branch (ASB).  These services will support ASB in assuring the development of environmental data which are of sufficient quality to meet the technical and analytical needs of OSRTI.  
It is the Government's intent to award a single cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract from this solicitation using full and open competition.  The resulting contract will provide for the issuance of task orders with fixed rates for labor for specific requirements.  
The anticipated ordering period includes one 24-month Base Period and three 12-month Option Periods.  The EPA also anticipates an additional 24-month award term beginning after month 60.  The maximum potential ordering period may total no more than 84 months.  The Government reserves the right to not issue the 24-month award term in the event that the Contractor is unable to meet or exceed the performance metrics (included in the solicitation) that will be measured to determine issuing the award term or if it is in the best interest of the Government.  The total estimated level of effort for this requirement is 617,560 hours, inclusive of all optional quantities.
The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7M.  The solicitation for this procurement is anticipated to be released on or about February 2010 and proposals will be due thirty days from the posting date.  This procurement will be conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation.
The solicitation, any possible amendments, and other procurement-related information will be posted on EPA's Office of Acquisition Management Superfund/RCRA Regional Procurement Operations Division website at the following address: http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/lasc/1010391/index.htm.  Interested parties are required to download the Request for Proposals (RFP) and all related documents from the aforementioned site and regularly monitor it for updates.  No printed copies of RFP will be distributed.
Offerors will be evaluated on factors including personnel, technical approach, past performance, certifications, small business utilization, and price.  Contract award will be made using a best value approach.  The anticipated award date for this requirement is on or about July 2010, with the Base Period commencing in November 2010.
All inquiries and questions regarding this solicitation shall be submitted in writing to the Contract Specialist, Matthew Courtad, at courted.matt@epa.gov.  TELEPHONE CALLS REGARDING THIS PROCUREMENT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO QUOTERS WHO HAVE A GSA SCHEDULE 70 CONTRACT.

THIS PROCUREMENT WILL BE FUNDED VIA THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009.

The scope of this requirement is to provide development and consultative support in updating and modernizing the existing Program Information Management System Case Management System, resulting in a new version (PIMS 2.0) for the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR).  Since the Case Management System was initially rolled out into production, there have been significant changes in both technology and business processes.

The estimated period of performance of this requirement is March 1, 2010 through April 31, 2011.

The solicitation will not be provided to subcontractors, suppliers or vendors.   The solicitation will not be available through the internet. Subcontractors, suppliers and vendors may request a copy of the planholders list after the RFP is issued in order to contact prime contractors regarding business opportunities. <BR><BR>Contracting Procedures: The solicitation will be a request for proposal (RFP).

<DESC>A.  General Information:<BR><BR>Northwest Region will initiate the standardization process for Wound Care-Basic for its seven Army, Navy, and Air Force medical facilities in Washington and Alaska.  The product line consists of various models and types of Wound Care-Basic. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize products or product lines obtaining the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price based on volume pricing discounts utilizing a best value determination process. Standardized products will be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR> <BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the NorthWest region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Region include but are not limited to:<BR>Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA.<BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award. For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil. <BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is 02/10.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>The Point of Contact is Rosa Crumpton, phone: 253-968-0898, and e-mail rosa.crumpton@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B. Products & Performance Required<BR>The NorthWest Region is seeking Wound Care-Basic which at a minimum include the product lines below. Within the region, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $188,091. This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project include:<BR>MANUF_NAME<BR>MANUF_PART_NUM<BR>SHORT_ITEM_DESC<BR>PV Sales<BR>KENDALL<BR>6715<BR>BANDAGE ROLL KERLIX 4.5IN X4.1YD 6-PLY<BR>$65,399.76<BR>KENDALL<BR>3085<BR>SPONGE SUPER KERLIX 6X6-3/4IN MEDIUM<BR>$22,022.88<BR>KENDALL<BR>2556<BR>SPONGE GAUZE CURITY 4X4IN 8-PLY BULK<BR>$14,547.43<BR>KENDALL<BR>2146<BR>SPONGE GAUZE CURITY 2X2IN 8-PLY BULK<BR>$13,176.89<BR>KENDALL<BR>2913<BR>SPONGE COVER CURITY 4X4IN STERILE<BR>$10,894.40<BR>KENDALL<BR>1806<BR>SPONGE GAUZE CURITY 2X2IN 8-PLY<BR>$8,795.93<BR>KENDALL<BR>2252<BR>SPONGE GAUZE CURITY 2X2IN 12-PLY BULK<BR>$8,109.13<BR>KENDALL<BR>2835<BR>SPONGE GAUZE CURITY 4X8IN 12-PLY BULK<BR>$5,947.34<BR>KENDALL<BR>9194A<BR>PAD ABDOMINAL CURITY 8X10IN STERILE<BR>$4,974.91<BR>KENDALL<BR>6939<BR>SPONGE GAUZE CURITY 4X4IN 12-PLY<BR>$4,348.28<BR><BR>At the request of the Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor<BR><BR>C. Instructions to Vendors <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to rosa.crumpton@amedd.army.mil.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D. Evaluation Criteria <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the NorthWest Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Source Selection Procedures:<BR><BR>Pre-Source Selection Procedures:<BR><BR>1. The TRBO has used market research to confirm the availability of the product which the Northwest Region DSL has selected for standardization. <BR>2. The MTFs in the Region volunteer and Clinical Product Team (CPT) members are selected for participation in the standardization process.  The 3 MTFs that will be participating in the clinical evaluation of this standardization initiative are Bassett Army Community Hospital, AK; Naval Hospital Bremerton, WA; and Elmendorf Air Force Base Hospital, AK.<BR>3. The Clinical Product Team (CPT) validates/approves the equally weighted criteria outlined below.<BR>4. The CPT determined and approved that both literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation in a non clinical/non-patient setting. Requested samples will only include high-volume products. <BR>5. The Northwest Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) develops and submits the APP and Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) Request for Quotes through the DSL for review by Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP). <BR><BR>Source Selection Procedure:<BR><BR>1. This selection procedure is a one-step source selection process. The Northwest Region will post the RFQ to the FBO for a period of 21 calendar days. A letter (email) notice to the current vendors identified in the market share analysis above will be sent after the FBO is posted. The closing date and time will be the same, for the RFQ and for the email notification. <BR>2. Vendors will provide an initial response to the FBO posted RFQ by emailing their interest in participating in the standardization process to the point of contact (POC) listed on the FBO. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial response regarding their interest in participating in the standardization process, actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of close of business (COB) 4:00 pm (PST) Pacific Standard Time on the date listed for closing on the FBO RFQ, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. <BR>3. The TRBO will request responses to the technical/company criteria, no charge literature, no charge sample set, and best value pricing from the vendor in a one-step source selection process. The one-step source selection process provides vendors with 14 calendar days to respond to the TRBO with the completed spreadsheet for both the Technical/Company criteria and the Vendors best value price quote; and deliver the no charge literature and no charge samples to the MTFs participating in the clinical evaluation process. The Technical/Company Criteria and Best Value Price Quote worksheets will be sent to the vendor via email and will include a due date. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions and criteria listed in the FBO announcement. Vendors that do not respond to the technical/company criteria will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. Literature and samples must be received by the participating MTFs by COB 4:00 PM PST, 21 days after the date of request to supply samples. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment.  The samples to be provided are as follows: Sample Set- 1 set to each MTF:  Qty: 1 ea-BANDAGE ROLL KERLIX 4.5IN X4.1YD 6-PLY, Qty: 1-SPONGE GAUZE CURITY 4X24N 8-PLY BULK, Qty: 1-SPONGE SUPER KERLIX 6X6-3/4IN MEDIUM, Qty: 4 ea-PAD ABDOMINAL CURITY 8X10IN STERILE<BR>4. Vendors that do not meet the deadline to deliver the literature and samples by the deadline or fail to send literature and samples to the MTFs will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. Vendors best value pricing will be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Northwest Region. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submission/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off the Vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northwest Region). Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. However, the Region reserves the right to request revised quotes, if determined necessary. The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. Vendors that fail to submit price quotes will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing by e-mail at the conclusion of the process.<BR>5. The TRBO team will compile the technical/company criteria responses and the results will be forwarded to the CPT. The technical and company criteria are weighted equally. The TRBO will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services, 2) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional more specific definition of technical acceptability. The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. <BR>6. The CPT members will evaluate each vendors literature and sample set against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last up to 14 calendar days. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert type scale with a 1-5 scoring range. The scale descriptors are: One (1) = Strongly Disagree; Two (2) = Disagree; Three (3) = Neutral; Four (4) = Agree; and Five (5) = Strongly Agree. The CPT will send the completed evaluations to the TRBO for data entry and analysis and the results will be forwarded to the TPRB for review. <BR>7. The vendors will forward price quotes to the TRBO, the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis, and the results will be forwarded to the TPRB for review. The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is included as a reporting metric), and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items. Cost avoidance is used as a reporting metric, not as an element of the decision. The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the DAPA prices will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the offer.<BR>8. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. The Northwest Region TPRB will review the data to support a selection of the best value, lower overall cost quote. The TPRB will vote on a standardized vendor for Wound Care-Basic.  Each MTF on the TPRB is allotted one vote for the selection of the standardized vendor.  The votes are tallied and the vendor with the majority of votes is the selected standardized vendor.  A multiple award is a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region.<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT developed, validated, and approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below.  The vendor must provide the information requested by each of the criteria.  A response of YES indicates that the company confirms that it can meet the criteria without exception.   A response of NO followed by an explanatory statement is permitted in order to explain any exceptions. <BR><BR>1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Wound Care-Basic.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  Wound Care-Basic products required by the region (at a minimum) are gauze (various sizes; sterile and non-sterile) and sponges (various sizes; sterile and non-sterile).  NOTE:  Vendors:  Please state that you can provide a complete product line and a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.).  In addition, send any applicable product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR>2. Vendors must have a DAPA, or be in the process of applying for a DAPA, for the Wound Care-Basic Product Line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Regions Prime Vendor (currently, Cardinal Health is the PV for distribution in Region 11.)  Please provide documentation of your companys agreement with this Prime Vendor.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR>4. Vendors must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offer a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT developed, validated, and approved the following equally weighted clinical/performance criteria.  <BR><BR>Criteria will be evaluated one time in a non-clinical setting by at least one Clinical Product Team member at each participating facility.<BR> <BR>1. Product is highly absorbent.<BR>a. Product must transfer exudates from wound.<BR>b. Evaluator will place product in water to simulate absorption.<BR>2. Product is low linting/free of foreign particles.<BR>a. Product must not introduce debris or foreign particles.<BR>b. Evaluator will shake product to determine if linting or debris is noted.<BR>3. Product may be cut to the desired shape or size without shredding/unraveling. <BR>a. Product must not introduce debris or foreign particles while being cut.<BR>b. Evaluator will cut product with scissors to determine if linting or debris is noted.<BR><BR>Post-Source Selection Procedures:  <BR><BR>1. The TRBO prepares the Decision Document for signature by the DSL and submits a package including the clinicians comments to DSCP for review and approval.  <BR>2. The RIA is initiated by the TRBO.  Vendors will be contacted and the TRBO will notify the TPRB, DSCP, PVM, and regional MTFs.<BR>3. If requested by a vendor, the TRBO will informally share information on the selection.  The Region will notify DSCP immediately in instances in which a vendor expresses substantial dissatisfaction with the evaluation.<BR>4. The selected vendor is given 15 calendar days to upload their RIA pricing to DSCP.<BR>5. The TRBO follows-up with the vendor and DSCP to insure pricing is loaded in the UDR. <BR>6. The TRBO assists the Regional MTFs in conversion implementation and reviews their compliance.<BR>7. The TRBO markets the clinically preferred product selection and cost avoidance benefits.<BR><BR><BR>Rules of Engagement: <BR>a. Clinicians will use an evaluation tool, which will be collected by the TRBO.<BR>b. CPT members can have no invested personal interest in the outcome in a standardization effort. <BR>c. CPT members will be familiar with the specific guidelines for accepting gifts and incentive type items from vendors.  Any violations of the guidelines will be reported to the appropriate officials.  <BR>d. The TRBO will perform statistical analysis of data obtained from the evaluations.<BR>e. Vendors presence will not be required during this evaluation.<BR>f. When participating in a standardization effort, vendors must contact the TRBO prior to contacting any clinical personnel in reference to the product being considered for standardization. <BR>g. Additional education or training on the selected products will be at the vendors expense. <BR>h. All evaluation methods will have a start and stop date set by the CPT that will be strictly enforced.  <BR>i. The government is not responsible for cost of sample items, shipping of these items, or any costs associated with the clinical evaluations.<BR>j. Only products selected by the CPT will be reviewed during an evaluation.  All other products presented during the evaluation will be rejected.<BR>k. Unless specifically requested by the TRBO, NO COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD SPEAK TO ANY HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBER OR TPRB MEMBER REGARDING PRICE OR PRICE-RELATED FACTORS.<BR><BR>Failure to comply with any of the rules of engagement described above may result in disqualification of your company from further consideration.  <BR><BR>Please do not hesitate to contact our Clinical Analyst at 253-968-0898 for questions.

Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Source Selection Procedures: <BR>Pre-Source Selection Procedures:<BR>1. The TRBO has used market research to confirm the availability of the product which the Northwest Region DSL has selected for standardization. <BR>2. The MTFs in the Region volunteer and Clinical Product Team (CPT) members are selected for participation in the standardization process.  The 3 MTFs that will be participating in the clinical evaluation of this standardization initiative are Bassett Army Community Hospital, AK; Naval Hospital Bremerton, WA; and Elmendorf Air Force Base Hospital, AK.<BR>3. The Clinical Product Team (CPT) validates/approves the equally weighted criteria outlined below.<BR>4. The CPT determined and approved that both literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation in a clinical setting. Requested samples will only include high-volume products. <BR>5. The Northwest Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) develops and submits the APP and Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) Request for Quotes through the DSL for review by Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP). <BR>Source Selection Procedure<BR>1. This selection procedure is a one-step source selection process. The Northwest Region will post the RFQ to the FBO for a period of 21 calendar days. A letter (email) notice to the current vendors identified in the market share analysis above will be sent after the FBO is posted. The closing date and time will be the same, for the RFQ and for the email notification. <BR>2. Vendors will provide an initial response to the FBO posted RFQ by emailing their interest in participating in the standardization process to the point of contact (POC) listed on the FBO. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial response regarding their interest in participating in the standardization process, actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of close of business (COB) 4:00 pm (PST) Pacific Standard Time on the date listed for closing on the FBO RFQ, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. <BR>3. The TRBO will request responses to the technical/company criteria, no charge literature, no charge sample set, and best value pricing from the vendor in a one-step source selection process. The one-step source selection process provides vendors with 14 calendar days to respond to the TRBO with the completed spreadsheet for both the Technical/Company criteria and the Vendors best value price quote; and deliver the no charge literature and no charge samples to the MTFs participating in the clinical evaluation process. The Technical/Company Criteria and Best Value Price Quote worksheets will be sent to the vendor via email and will include a due date. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions and criteria listed in the FBO announcement. Vendors that do not respond to the technical/company criteria will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. Literature and samples must be received by the participating MTFs by COB 4:00 PM PST, 14 days after the date of request to supply samples. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment.  The samples to be provided are as follows: 1 set to each MTF: 2 ea-Non-latex, adhesive, elastic bandage wrap 4in width, 2 ea-Adhesive, elastic bandage wrap 4in width, 2 ea-Non-adhesive, elastic bandage wrap 6in width, 2 ea-Non-adhesive, elastic bandage wrap 4in width.<BR>4. Vendors that do not meet the deadline to deliver the literature and samples by the deadline or fail to send literature and samples to the MTFs will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. Vendors best value pricing will be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Northwest Region. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submission/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off the Vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northwest Region). Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. However, the Region reserves the right to request revised quotes, if determined necessary. The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. Vendors that fail to submit price quotes will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing by e-mail at the conclusion of the process.<BR>5. The TRBO team will compile the technical/company criteria responses and the results will be forwarded to the CPT. The technical and company criteria are weighted equally. The TRBO will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services, 2) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional more specific definition of technical acceptability. The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. <BR>6. The CPT members will evaluate each vendors literature and sample set against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last up to 14 days. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert type scale with a 1-5 scoring range. The scale descriptors are: One (1) = Strongly Disagree; Two (2) = Disagree; Three (3) = Neutral; Four (4) = Agree; and Five (5) = Strongly Agree. The CPT will send the completed evaluations to the TRBO for data entry and analysis and the results will be forwarded to the TPRB for review. <BR>7. The vendors will forward price quotes to the TRBO, the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis, and the results will be forwarded to the TPRB for review. The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is included as a reporting metric), and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items. Cost avoidance is used as a reporting metric, not as an element of the decision. The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the DAPA prices will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the offer.<BR>8. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. The Northwest Region TPRB will review the data to support a selection of the best value, lower overall cost quote. The TPRB will vote on a standardized vendor for Elastic Bandage Wraps.  Each MTF on the TPRB is allotted one vote for the selection of the standardized vendor.  The votes are tallied and the vendor with the majority of votes is the selected standardized vendor.  A multiple award is a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region.<BR>Technical/Company Criteria:<BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the TPRB validated/approved the equally weighted technical/company criteria outline below:<BR>1. Vendors must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Elastic Bandage Wraps. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes the following products: Non-latex, adhesive, elastic bandage wrap in various sizes including 1.5in width, 2inx5 yd, 3in width, 4in width; Adhesive, elastic bandage wrap in various sizes including 1in width, 2inx5 yd, 3in width, 4in width; Non-adhesive, elastic bandage in various sizes including 2inx5 yd, 3in width, 4in width, 6in width.<BR>2. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for Elastic Bandage Wraps. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.<BR>3. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. Vendors whose products are not available through the regional Prime Vendor will be disqualified.<BR>4. Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA. Vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.<BR>5. Vendors must carry latex free versions of Elastic Bandage Wraps.<BR>6. Vendors must carry sterile and non-sterile Elastic Bandage Wraps.<BR><BR>Clinical and Performance Criteria:<BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outline below:<BR><BR>Criteria will be evaluated one time in a non-clinical setting by at least one Clinical Product Team member at each participating facility.<BR><BR>1. Product unrolls evenly and lies flat upon application.<BR>a. The wrap woven material will not clump, crease or bunch together during the application. Product will maintain even layers of woven materials, avoiding clumping, creasing or bunching of layers, which would put unequal compression on the patient.<BR>b. The evaluators will apply the bandage wrap on each other, rolling the wraps in the acceptable circular application. The expectation is that the woven material will not clump, crease or bunch together and cause uneven compression and pain to the patient.<BR>2. Product maintains therapeutic elasticity throughout application.<BR>a. The bandage wrap will retain elasticity (elastic memory) when the bandage wrap is wrapped.<BR>b. The evaluators will apply the bandage wrap on each other, rolling the wraps in the acceptable circular application. The expectation is that the bandage wrap will retain therapeutic elastic memory and provide therapeutic equal compression.<BR>3. Products closure adheres securely and evenly.<BR>a. The products closure will stay closed. <BR>b. The evaluators will examine point of closure on product. The expectation is that the bandage wrap will adhere securely and evenly against itself, eliminating the possibility that the bandage wrap will become loose or fall off thereby, losing the therapeutic effects of the product.  <BR><BR>Post-Source Selection Procedures:  <BR><BR>1. The TRBO prepares the Decision Document for signature by the DSL and submits a package including the clinicians comments to DSCP for review and approval.  <BR>2. The RIA is initiated by the TRBO.  Vendors will be contacted and the TRBO will notify the TPRB, DSCP, PVM, and regional MTFs.<BR>3. If requested by a vendor, the TRBO will informally share information on the selection.  The Region will notify DSCP immediately in instances in which a vendor expresses substantial dissatisfaction with the evaluation.<BR>4. The selected vendor is given 15 calendar days to upload their RIA pricing to DSCP.<BR>5. The TRBO follows-up with the vendor and DSCP to insure pricing is loaded in the UDR. <BR>6. The TRBO assists the Regional MTFs in conversion implementation and reviews their compliance.<BR>7. The TRBO markets the clinically preferred product selection and cost avoidance benefits.<BR><BR>Rules of Engagement<BR><BR>a. The TRBO will perform statistical analysis of data obtained from the evaluations.<BR>b. Vendors presence will not be required during this evaluation.<BR>c. When participating in a standardization effort, vendors must contact the TRBO prior to contacting any clinical personnel in reference to the product being considered for standardization. <BR>d. Additional education or training on the selected products will be at the vendors expense. <BR>e. All evaluation methods will have a start and stop date set by the CPT that will be strictly enforced.  <BR>f. The government is not responsible for cost of sample items, shipping of these items, or any costs associated with the clinical evaluations.<BR>g. Only products selected by the CPT will be reviewed during an evaluation.  All other products presented during the evaluation will be rejected.<BR>h. Unless specifically requested by the TRBO, NO COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD SPEAK TO ANY HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBER OR TPRB MEMBER REGARDING PRICE OR PRICE-RELATED FACTORS.<BR>Failure to comply with any of the rules of engagement described above may result in disqualification of your company from further consideration.  Please do not hesitate to contact our Clinical Analyst at 253-968-0898 for questions.

<DESC>Description
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis constitutes a request for information to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify potential sources that meet Air Force requirements. 500 CBSS/GBLB, the Ground Theater Air Control-System Support Office (GTACS-SSO) located at Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) is requesting information from all businesses to assist in the planning for the acquisition of Voice Control Access System -Touchscreen (VCAS-TS)hardware for the AN/TYQ-23 (v)5 operations module (OM). Any set aside and small business programs decisions will be made after market research is complete.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>a. Current AN/TYQ-23 (v)5 trackball/mouse arrangement does not allow operators to effectively manipulate command assets to coordinate/deconflict air space issues during peak flying times. Operators cannot control the mouse rapidly enough to perform the various switch actions required for manipulating the air picture and connecting them via telephone and radio to aircraft and outside air traffic control, command and control, and sister service organizations. The Modular Control Equipment (MCE), AN/TYQ-23(v)5, was produced for the United States Air Force (USAF). Seventy MCE OMs' were functionally upgraded from the (v)3 version and remain in active service.</p>
<p>b. The previous version of the OM (TYQ-23(v)3) had separate touchscreen panels for communication control and air picture manipulation, allowing the operator to use both hands to control these functions. The current configuration places both of these functions on one screen, controlled by one mouse/trackball.</p>
<p>c. The (v)3 to (v)5 upgrade included the capability to integrate software applications, running on the open architecture internal or external System Server Unit (SSU) with the native OM operational software system running in the legacy AYK&shy;14 Computer Units (CUs).</p>
<p>d. In 2006, Northrop Grumman Engineering Systems (NGES) developed an engineering solution for the VCAS-TS to address the above requirement which was incorporated into the AN/TYQ-23(v)5. The Air Force will use that engineering solution for fleetwide modifications to the entire AN/TYQ-23 fleet (70ea systems). The Air Force's immediate VCAS-TS requirement will meet the specific government technical drawing package, which will be provided.</p>
<p>Requirements<br />a. Produce, test, and deliver (77ea) VCAS-TS kits for the AN/TYQ-23 (v)5 OM per the VCAS-TS Technical Drawing Package (TDP) provided by the US Government (USG). The first production unit will be the First Article. Relevant CDRL's will be provided.<br />b. This is not a new design effort and will not address any current system deficiencies or implement corrections. <br />c. The contractor shall identify, test and update TDP any part substitutions that result from parts availability or obsolescence problems discovered during production. All part(s) substitutions shall require prior approval by the USG.<br />d. No changes to VCAS -TS computer operating system or applications software are anticipated. <br />e. Master copies of the new firmware for this kit will be provided by the USG and the contractor shall accurately reproduce the firmware in the quantities required (as part of kit delivery).<br />f. The contractor shall support a provisioning conference to assess requirements for operational spares and equipment to address long term supportability of VCAS -TS hardware.<br />g. The contractor shall develop Special Packing Instructions (SPI) for the VCAS-TS Kit IAW MIL-STD-2073, Appendix E. The USG will approve the SPI. The contractor shall package the VCAS-TS Kits IAW the approved SPI.<br />Requested Responses</p>
<p>Each interested entity that has the capability to meet the production requirements for VCAS-TS hereby has the opportunity to provide supporting rationale to that effect. Each interested entity that has the capability to meet any specific (or all)of the requirements is requested to provide the following information to help the Air Force determine prospective contractors:</p>
<p>a. Please provide formal responses to the tasks listed below.

<p>g. Are you a kitting company?</p>
<p>h. What size is your business?</p>
<p>j. What is your socio-economic?</p>

The Display Unit, SU-180/AVS-7(V) is part of the AN/AVS-7 family of Heads Up Display (HUD).  The HUD enables helicopter pilots to use the Aviators Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) goggles during flight operations.  The SU-180/AVS-7(V) provides critical operational <BR>information to the pilot superimposed over the ANVIS image.  As part of the HUD, the <BR>SU-180/AVS-7(V) minimizes the requirement for the pilot and co-pilot to look at the flight <BR>instruments, thus allowing them to concentrate on scanning outside of the cockpit.<BR><BR>       The government is seeking interested sources for the Urgent Repair and Maintenance of the <BR>SU-180/AVS-7(V) Display Units.  The government seeks the services to repair seventy-eight (78) Display Units.  Duration of the contract is four months.  Respondents must be able to meet a first delivery of repaired units thirty (30) days after contract award.  Respondents must have extensive knowledge of the AN/AVS-7 HUD system.   Potential offerors will be responsible for turning the nonfunctional Display Units received from the government into ones which meet the most current operation form, fit, and function as called out by applicable technical data.  This effort also requires the maintenance of a parts inventory sufficient to support the aforementioned repair effort.  Depot Maintenance Work Requirements (DMWRs) do not exist for this equipment.  A complete technical data package was never procured and therefore is unavailable.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

GSA, Federal Acquisition Service (FAS)
Office of Acquisition Management

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Disclosure Data Call
January 14, 2010

GENERAL INFORMATION

Document Type:
Request for Information (RFI)

Point of Contact:
Adam F. Jones

BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Executive Order 13514 – Section 13, the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) is leading the federal government’s efforts to create a more sustainable supply chain.  Section 13 of the E.O. requires GSA to examine the feasibility of requiring vendors and contractors to register with a voluntary registry or organization for reporting greenhouse gas emissions.  GSA is considering the use of a third-party contractor to reach out to a subset of federal contractors, assist them in gathering information about GHG emissions and facilitate the disclosure of this information via a web-based data entry system.  

OBJECTIVES
GSA is interested in gathering information on any contractors that have significant experience (5 years or more) providing this type of service.  

Essential features of the required service include:

&#61656;	A collection process and flexible data entry system that allows respondents to identity the most appropriate method of GHG disclosure and input data in multiple formats
&#61656;	Allows for the disclosure of entry level to fully verified inventories
&#61656;	Information requests that encourage change and innovation
&#61656;	Gives consideration to the data collection approach for small and medium businesses vs. large firms
&#61656;	Fee structure that does not charge participating federal contractors


GSA is not seeking a contractor to provide independent verification of GHG reporting.  

RESPONSES
For capable contractors, please provide information on previous experience and the methodologies that would be used to gather GHG emission inventories.  Respondents must be capable of providing the service for a large number of participants (200 contractors initially, and, potentially, over 17,000 over the next few years).  

Responses shall be sent to Adam Jones at Adam.Jones@gsa.gov not later than Thursday, January 21, 2010.

PUBLIC RECORDS AND REQUESTS FOR CONFIDENTIALITY
Any document submitted that contains confidential information must be marked on the outside as containing confidential information, and each page upon which confidential information appears must be marked as containing confidential information.  The confidential information must be clearly identifiable to the reader wherever it appears.  

COPYRIGHTS
By submitting a response, the vendor agrees that the government may copy the response for purposes of facilitation of review or to respond to requests for public records.  The vendor represents that such copying will not violate any copyrights in the materials submitted.

CONTENT OF RESPONSES
Responses should be based on the material contained in this RFI and any other relevant information the vendor thinks is appropriate.  Responses will not be returned.

COST TO VENDORS
The government is not responsible for any costs incurred by a vendor in relation to the preparation of a response to this RFI.

NO OBLIGATION TO ISSUE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL 
The issuance of this RFI does not obligate the government in any way to issue an RFQ or RFP for the services described.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Eastern Region, Wayne National Forest, Nelsonville, Ohio plans to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Professional Surveying Services.  The work will primarily involve surveying and marking property boundaries of land within the Wayne National Forest Boundary.  The Wayne National Forest is divided into 2 Ranger Districts; The Athens Ranger District (Headquartered in Nelsonville, Ohio) and the Ironton Ranger District (Headquartered in Pedro, Ohio).  Up to two contracts may be awarded, one for each Ranger District. Contract will include a base year and 4 options of 1 year each.  Fixed price task orders issued under the basic contract will include a specific statement of work and be negotiated as individual projects.  The cumulative total of all task orders issued under this contract cannot exceed $1,000,000 for the total 5 year period.  The minimum guarantee for the 5 year period is $10,000 during the life of the contract.  This is a 100% Total Small Business Set Aside.  Individual task orders will be issued against each contract as needed to accomplish the work. Completion time will vary with each individual task order, and will be negotiated prior to task order award. The contracts will not preclude the Forest Service from using its own surveyors, or other surveying firms to perform surveys in the project area.  

The types of Professional Services include, but are not limited to, identification, monumentation and perpetuation of property corners and controlling corners for land surveys performed to locate property boundaries, boundary line posting and maintenance of previously posted lines. The projects may also include right-of-way surveys, topographic surveys, geodetic control, mapping and other incidental work normally associated with the survey profession.  

The A/E firm shall furnish all services, materials, supplies, plant, labor, equipment, investigations, inspections, tests, studies, superintendence and travel as required.  The projects may be located at various locations throughout the Wayne National Forest.  Only firms with Registered Professional Surveyor(s) licensed in the State in of Ohio will be considered.  An Ohio Registered Professional Land Surveyor must be assigned to each task order.   

Firms will be evaluated on the following factors in order of priority:

(1)  Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.  Provide information pertaining to your firm’s Ohio Registered Professional Land Surveyors (RPLS).  Include experience in conducting of Public Land Surveys.   Indicate anticipated level of involvement of each RPLS on this project.  
(2)  Capacity of the firm to provide the required services in the required time:  List your firm’s available personnel and procedures used to ensure reasonable deadlines are met.     Include any proposed subcontractor(s) and specify what duties they would perform.  Include SF Form 330 part I and Part II as necessary for all proposed sub-contractors.
(3)  Past performance on contracts with government agencies (Federal, State and Local) and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.  Provide between 3 and 7 references for projects that are similar in scope to cadastral surveys and boundary line marking.
(4)  Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required.   Highlight projects involving boundary surveys that required property line marking performed by the key personnel that will be assigned to the work.   Proposal should also include the firm’s quality control plan for field and office work.
(5)  Proximity of the firm to local project area:   Indicate where your nearest office is in relation to the Project Headquarters. (Nelsonville, Ohio and Pedro, Ohio).   If not within a 50-mile radius of the Project Headquarters, indicate how you plan to provide service in a cost-effective manner.  The A/E firm will not receive travel reimbursement for same-day travel to/from either project headquarters for any required face-to-face meetings.
(6)  Cadastral Survey knowledge, records research, and resolution of conflicting evidence:  Discuss your firm’s knowledge of cadastral survey practices, records research and the approach you have used on previous surveys to resolve problems resulting from conflicting title or physical evidence.  Include one Record of Survey from a boundary survey, sealed by a licensed land surveyor who will conduct boundary surveys under an awarded contract. The survey should demonstrate principles relevant to these criteria.

Firms qualified and interested in providing the Boundary (Cadastral) Survey Services described in this synopsis are invited to submit Standard (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire in one (1) original and three (4) copies with appropriate data to USDA Forest Service to be received by 3:00 p.m. eastern time, February 12, 2010.  Parts 1 and 2 must be completed and submitted for all contractors, subcontractors and proposed consultants.  NO FAXED, ELECTRONIC, TELEGRAPHIC OR TELEPHONIC SUBMITTAL WILL BE ACCEPTED; failure to forward the paper copies of the requested documents will result in your firm not being considered for award.

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Allen Scientific Glass Inc of Boulder, CO for the purchase of 155 specialized air sampling flasks.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for 155 two-valved air flasks with serial numbers which have been tested extensively for stability with respect to the trace gases of interest.</p>
<p>The Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases (CCGG) group of the Global Monitoring Division (GMD)operates a global air sampling network to measure the distribution and variations of climatically important trace gases (CO2, CH4, CO, H2, N2O, SF6) and stable isotopic ratios (13C/12C, 18O/16O of CO2 in the global atmosphere. GMD has recently added measurements of the D/H rations of CH4, 14C of CO2 and 10 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the data collection efforts.</p>
<p>These air samples are collected in 2.5 liter borosilicate glass flasks sealed by means of Teflon O-ring stopcocks and serially numbered. Because these gases are long-lived and well mixed in the atmosphere, the spatial and temporal variations are relatively small. This requires that the measurements are extremely accurate and precise, on the order of 0.03% for CO2. To obtain the needed levels of accuracy and precision, the air sample composition must not change (gain or loss of any trace gas molecules) during storage in the flasks over time periods ranging from weeks to 1.5 years. Any changes in the materials or methods used in the measurements require time-consuming testing to insure that artifacts or offsets are not introduced into the existing long time series. Subtle artifacts could lead to erroneous interpretations of the data. Therefore, it is important that the flask material be non-reactive to the stored gases and that the valve stopcocks prohibit against leakage at a wide range of altitudes and pressures.</p>
<p>Market research has shown that these flasks are not readily available on the market and that they need to be manufactured in order to meet specifications for durability and inertness with respect to the trace gases being measured.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<CONTACT>Valerie M. Whipple, Phone 301-492-3628, Email valerie.whipple@nrc.gov
<DESC>THE U. S. NUCLEAR REGUALTORY COMMISSION (NRC) is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) as a means of conducting market research or a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of the business community to provide all management, supervision, administration, and labor for stenographic-based captioning for real-time verbatim captioning services.  These services will be used for hearings and/or meetings to be held, sometimes simultaneously, in various locations throughout the United States, primarily at the NRC Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland and the Las Vegas, Nevada hearing site.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this acquisition is 561492, Court Reporting and Stenotype Services, with a size standard of $7.0 million dollars.  
	
In keeping with the NRC’s mission to protect the public health and safety in the Nuclear Reactor, Materials and (High and Low level) Waste arenas, many Commission meetings are held as part of the decision making process of licensing nuclear facilities.  Aside and separate from the Commission meetings, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel (ASLBP) conduct many adjudicatory hearings for the Commission on licensing and enforcement matters, usually at a location near the site where the dispute arose.  The ASLBP hearings will require real-time reporting captioning services that will interact with the agency’s digital information retrieval and display system know as the Digital Data Management System (DDMS).  The DDMS will be operational in hearing room facilities located in Rockville, Maryland, and Las Vegas, Nevada and in various other locations throughout the United States.  Many lawyers to these proceedings require use of the hearing transcripts prior to the start of the next day of hearing.  Therefore, electronic transcripts, submitted via the NRC’s Electronic Information Exchange system, for these proceedings, will be expected on an expedited and most times overnight turn-around basis. IMPORTANTLY, THE COMMISSION AND ASLBP PROCEEDINGS WILL REQUIRE THE CAPTIONIST TO PERFORM ON-SITE AT THE MEETING/PROCEEDINGS.  REMOTE CAPTIONING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.  Occasionally, captioning services will be required to be added to a videotape after a meeting has been held.  
	
To increase public confidence in the transparency and fairness of the regulatory process, one of the primary means of keeping the public informed is to open the proceedings to a wider audience by using real-time captioning/reporting.  These proceedings are an extremely important, technically complex, and closely scrutinized part of the ASLBP and Commission’s daily operations. 
	
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposal; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  All firms are invited to submit a response.  

If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services for NRC free of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCOI), please provide the following information.  Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested.

1) Organization name, address, email address, web site address and telephone number.

2) How long has your company been in operations?

3) What is the size of your business?

4) What is the ownership status of your company (e.g., service-disabled veteran-owned, woman-owned, 8(a), etc.)?

5) How many people does your company employ, including consultants?  Please break down the mix between the two categories.

6) List any companies or government agencies your company either plans to or has performed work for related to this RFI.  Describe the work performed.

7) Although no geographic restriction is anticipated, if responding organizations are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area, indicate how the organization would coordinate with the NRC program office located in Rockville, MD to provide support to multiple sites.

8) Would your organization be capable of:
•	Captioning on-site during meetings, as remote captioning is not acceptable.
•	Meeting or exceeding a 98% accuracy rate while captioning
•	Providing next day electronic transcripts 

9) Describe any other information your company deems relevant for this RFI.

Interested firms responding to this RFI are encouraged to structure capability statements in the order of the areas of consideration noted above.  Responding firms should send tailored capability statement electronically to valerie.whipple@nrc.gov within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice. This market survey is being conducted through the FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.

<p>USSOCOM currently possesses and operates Oracle Servers and software programs via licensing purchase/agreement. Contract requirements include technical support for software updates working within the source code. Oracle develops and manages proprietary software source codes, and does not allow other companies to access Oracle source code information. Replacing the database software with another product is not feasible considering changeover cost and compatibility with current applications. Consequently, Oracle is the only capable and authorized source to meet the government's technical support requirements.</p>

<DESC>The Competition Advocates Shopping List (CASL) located at http://www.redstone.army.mil/cmo for both Aviation and Missile commodities in the areas of Spare/Repair Parts, Maintenance & Overhaul and Major Items/Services has been updated. The CASL reflects projected procurements covering up to 5 out-years. We have other pertinent information that will benefit both the contracting community and redstone community. Please view our updated Consumable Items Transferred to Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) listings. These listings reflect items already transferred and those to be transferred during FY 10, along with DLA points of contact and telephone numbers. Also, we have added a Depot Level Reparables listing that reflects those NSN's being procured by either AMCOM or DLA. Feel free to contact our office if you have any questions or concerns at cmo@us.army.mil or you can go to our FAQ button. We look for ways to improve our site, so any suggestions you have would be appreciated. Also, under CASL for Spare/Repair Parts Projections, you can request access to 'View Top Drawings' for those NSN's that contain a Distribution Code of 'A' or 'C'. These NSN's will be selectable. Per DoD Directive 5230.24, Distribution 'A' = Approved for public release or distribution is unlimited and Distribution 'C' = Distribution authorized to U.S. Government Agencies and their contractors. You will be required to obtain a one-time login and password to access this information. You will need to know your company's Joint Certification Number (7 digit number) and your DD-2345 expiration date. You can also visit our 'Reading Room' located in Bldg. 5303 at Redstone Arsenal, AL, which provides controlled access to Government Owned Technical Data and Drawings that are stored in our warehouse. You can only view the Top Drawing for those that have a Distribution Code of 'A' or 'C'.<BR><BR>Another area that has been updated is the Maintenance and Overhaul Source Approval Request (SAR) guidelines. Please view these very important changes located at http://www.redstone.army.mil/cmo/caslsar.htm#II. Here you can view the new 'Source Approval Prioritization Process', 'SAR Preparation & Submittal Guidance', 'SAR Contents and Process Briefing Charts' and 'SAR Process Requirements by CASL Category'. Also, the Spare/Repair Parts SAR guidance has a new 'SAR Prioritization Process' that can be viewed at http://www.redstone.army.mil/cmo/caslsar.htm#If.<BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY - Task Order Notification
<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA). This opportunity is available only for competition among the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity(IDIQ) awardees from solicitation 2008-N-09699. The awardees were: ABT (200-2008-27954), Battelle (200-2008-27956), Macro 200-2008-27957), RTI (200-2008-27958), SAIC (200-2008-27959), and Westat (200-2008-27960). Project Title: ARRA OS Enhancing cancer registry data for comparative effectiveness.</p>
<p>The purpose of this task order is to conduct activities to establish Specialized Cancer Registries to enhance data collected through a subset of population based central cancer registries for comparative effectiveness research. Activities include data collection, methodological development and pilot testing activities with the goal of enhancing cancer registry data for clinical follow-up. Outcomes will include a data set to be used for comparative effectiveness and other research. This data set will provide a unique set of data items in a single data set. Data from these funded activities will be made available for researchers through an established National Center for Health Statistics Research Data Center (RDC). The use of the RDC will allow CDC to protect the data as required by state laws authorizing the collection of cancer diagnoses and treatment data and CDC's Assurance of Confidentiality; and protect the confidentiality of patients whose data are included in the data set. It is anticipated that updates to the data will also be available through the RDC. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) terms, conditions and reporting will be applicable to the work under this project.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is a solicitation available.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: The work shall be from date of award through 9/30/2013.</p>

2)  Statutory Authority  permitting other than full and open competition. Identify the statutory authority permitting with the FAR citation and FAR citation Title. FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency.
3) WHY are the proposed contractor's unique qualifications for the nature of the acquisition requiring the use of the authority cited in item (2). The contractor is uniquely qualified to assist the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at this the initial implementation of the Agreement on the Conservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population (Agreement).  The need for the Agreement was originally conceived and shepherd through the negotiating process by the contractor as the lead for the Service's polar bear program.  The contractor's efforts, working with the Alaska Nanuuq Commission, as well as counterparts in Russia, provided the information and ultimate impetus for this Agreement.   The contractor, alone, has the perspective to provide the coordination for this initial and crucial stage of the Agreement. Additionally, because of the Commission's need to have a options document prepared by its meeting in June 2010, the Government would suffer serious injury because it cannot reasonably obtain an expert to become fully cognizant of the interlaying components of this resource use issue. Furthermore, the agency cannot rapidly replace the contractor's 20 years in preparing and developing the Agreement. 
4) WHAT effort was made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practical. The issuance of this contract is a unique situation and an instance in which it is not possible to obtain competition. As noted above the contractor is uniquely qualified to meet the Service's needs and to provide the scope and frame of reference to the parties of the Agreement. While the Service has committed considerable effort to providing a basis for the option's document, the contractor's services are required to ensure that the resource use issues for the Chukchi Sea population of polar are accurately and completely captured at this moment in time.  The Service has vested significant effort and expense in creating the foundations needed for management of this protected species and without the contractor's intimate understanding of the resource use and stakeholder concerns the Government's ability to meets its obligations under the Marine mammal Protection Act would be compromised.  
5) A Description of the Market survey conducted and the results. Service employees contacted three experts in the field of wildlife conservation and stakeholder involvement in resource use issues, to inquire if they believed it was in the best interest of resource management to obtain expert assistance from an individual intimately involved in a resource use issue, especially when dealing with diverse stakeholder concerns.  All three experts indicated that because of the complexity of issues associated with such work they would seek insight from those with most direct knowledge.

The Security Risk Assessment for MeF R3.2 stressed the need for strong authentication and XML Threat Mitigation due to the introduction of Web services to the IRS infrastructure.  In 2005, the MeF PMO tasked CSC PRIME to conduct a Product Evaluation and Selection (PES) to mitigate the new XML Threat introduced by Web services and the tool selected was the Forum Sentry XML Gateway appliance. This item was subsequently added to the Enterprise Architecture (EA) Enterprise Standards Profile (ESP) as a requirement for any external Web services implementation within the enterprise. The ESP lists Standards and Products applicable to the IRS Target Architecture and all projects are required to adhere to these standards, using only those products listed in the ESP.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<p>The Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health, Department of Pharmacy intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 a contract for Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc- 415 High Molecular Weight Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin. This material is required to support ongoing clinical trials with multiple previously submitted Investigational New Drug (IND) applications with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Any change in the source of the material would require new analytical assays to be developed, new formulations to be produced, new IND's to be filed with the FDA, and would have a negative impact on the evaluation of data already generated from the ongoing trials.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414 and the threshold is 500 employees.</p>
<p>There are 3 ongoing NIH protocols using this substance, each with a separate IND describing the use and character of this sterile product. The Keyhole Limpet is a type of sea urchin and the Hemocyanin is a constituent of the sea urchin's blood which has been extracted in a certain way. There are differences in the activity of different colonies of Limpets and so, it is important for the integrity of the studies to get the KLH from the same source. The FDA is aware of the importance of this control factor in the ongoing protocols.</p>
<p>It is critical to the integrity of the protocols and the ongoing research that the KLH be from the current supply source previously used in the ongoing trials. Stellar Biotechnologies currently is the only provider that can supply the current source being used in the ongoing protocols. A Market survey was conducted in December 2009.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however all responses received within 5 days from the date of the publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability in writing to Mr. Brian Lind at the address stated below. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. There is no solicitation package available.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  DO NOT REGISTER AS A PLANSHOLDER.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the US Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with EAC Architects and Engineers, LLP for a new Architect-Engineer contract, to provide Architect and Engineering Services during construction of Modifications to State Road 90, Modified Deliveries to Everglades National Park, Tamiami Trail.  The contract will be an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract for a period of one year from date of award with options to extend for four additional years, not to exceed five years.  Work will be assigned by negotiated task orders. While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,000,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than $1,000,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $5,000,000.00 for the life of the contract.<BR><BR>This Justification and Authorization is necessitated by the fact that we do not have sufficient capacity to award the required services under the existing A/E contract with EAC.  Specifically, SAJ will require EAC to provide professional engineering services by individuals that are qualified to oversee construction of roads and bridges in the State of Florida to ensure the designers intent is met to complete the Modifications to State Road 90, Modified Deliveries to Everglades National Park, Tamiami Trail.  <BR><BR>EAC is the Designer of Record of the design of the Tamiami Trail Modifications Project.  They performed the Design Reports and the plans and specifications (P&S) design of roadway improvements, bridge, road removal, and culvert extensions for Tamiami Trail.  Plans and Specifications were completed to the final phase for construction advertisement.   To date, EAC has carried the Tamiami Trail to award and into EDC.  Due to the performance requirements of the original contract, EAC has accumulated knowledge and expertise on this project that is not available from any other firm.  It would be very costly to the Government, both financially and technically, to develop a new consultant's knowledge base of the Tamiami Trail Modifications Project. <BR><BR>Interested concerns should contact Claurice Dingle at 904-232-3736; (or email at Claurice.M.Dingle@usace.army.mil) on or before 29 January 2010 for information on submitting documentation demonstrating their qualifications to accomplish this project.

<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status.

Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract.

If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract.

Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-37. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ).   

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 811219, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following specifications, under the simplified acquisition procedures. This solicitation is posted full and open for all qualified businesses and will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

The Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) has requested the purchasing of a one-year maintenance and service contract for four mass spectrometers located in ORA field laboratories. 

Brand Name or Equal (Thermo Electron North America, LLC.)

LTQ XL MS Systems (S/N: LTQ20573, LTQ20574, LTQ20572, LTQ20562)

WORK DESCRIPTION

Each maintenance/service contract includes an unlimited number of demand on-site service visits with a maximum of 72-hour response time. The short response time is of critical value to the field labs to prevent building a back-log of samples. Most of the instruments in the labs operate around the clock to process samples that require a fast turn-around time due to numerous factors: perishable import samples need to be tested fast so as to make a decision on the admissibility of the product before it deteriorates at the dock, consumer-complaints need to be resolved as soon as possible, any analysis related to identifying outbreaks also is high-priority. Due to the sensitive nature of the analyses the ORA field labs have to perform on a daily basis, instrument reliability is of utmost importance. Instrument reliability can be achieved by appropriate service coverage administered by a professional company that can deliver the services in a fast, effective manner.

The service contract also includes support for technical inquiries within 2 hours. This is another very important feature the labs take advantage of routinely.  Many minor software or hardware problems may have simple solutions that can be addressed with technical phone support, thus further reducing instrument down-time.  Also, whenever the ORA field labs are faced with a new challenge, a new analyte to screen for, they have to rapidly develop new methods. Availability of advice from the vendor’s technical support staff when trying to run new methods on the instruments is a valuable resource. It aids in speedy implementation of new LC-MS methods to respond to new challenges.

The service contract also includes one preventative maintenance visit – maintenance visits prolong the life of the instruments, systematically replace consumable parts, and catch minor problems before they turn into big issues. Having the routine maintenance performed by the professionals most familiar with the instruments frees up time of FDA lab personnel.  These visits also ensure that laboratories are in compliance with quality management system requirements. 

The service contract also includes factory-certified replacement parts. 

The service contracts ensure reliable operation of the field instruments which in turn supports the critical analytical work the ORA labs perform on an everyday basis to promote food safety and defense.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number DG133W-10-RQ-0112 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and the provisions and clauses which are incorporated as part of this solicitation are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37. The NAICS code for this procurement is 721110, and the small business size standard is $7.0 million average annual receipts. This procurement is not a small business set aside. The line item being acquired is: Item 0001: In accordance with the attached Statement of Work, the Contractor shall provide facilities, lodging, food, and necessary equipment and services for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) Meteorologist/Hydrologist-In-Charge Meeting to be held April 19-23, 2010 at a location within 50 miles of NWS Headquarters (which is at 1325 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD). The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition, and there is one addendum to this provision. Specifically, this addendum is as follows. "The offeror shall provide, as part of its quotation, all of the information called for by Paragraph (b) of FAR 52.212-1. In providing the technical description called for by subparagraph (b)(4), the offeror shall separately address each aspect of the attached Statement of Work. As part of its response regarding the requirement for meal availability, the offeror shall identify the different menu options available for breakfast, lunch and dinner, together with the prices associated therewith, in order to demonstrate that attendees may eat all three daily meals at the facility within the daily Government per diem meals and incidental expenses (M&amp;IE) rate. With respect to the past performance information called for by subparagraph (b)(10), the offeror shall include three references." The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, will not be used. Award will be made to the technically acceptable offer from a responsible offeror which provides the best value to the Government. In order for an offer to be technically acceptable, the Government must determine that the offer adequately addresses all requirements of the attached Statement of Work. Elements of the Statement or Work that are indicated to be the Government's desire are not requirements; however, all other elements of the Statement of Work (other than the "Additional Information" contained in Paragraph 9 of the Statement of Work) are requirements. In order for an offeror to be responsible, the Contracting Officer must determine that the offeror complies with&nbsp;FAR 9.104. From among the pool of all technically acceptable offers from responsible offerors, the Government will determine that offer which provides the best value to the Government based on the following evaluation factors, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) the degree to which the offeror's facility and its support services will support the productivity, creativity, comfort, and convenience of the attendees; (2) past performance; and (3) price. The factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, as offers are rated closer together with respect to the non-price evaluation factors, price will become more important as a differentiating factor in the award selection. Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, "Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items," along with the offer. The clause at FAR 52.212-4, "Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items," applies to this acquisition, and there are no addenda to this clause.

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />Brand Name or equal to: IP Technologies Part No. IPTJ-TSIN-01-01
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number RA1341-10-RQ-0205DR.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 333298. The small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item:<br />CLIN # 0001 Brand Name or equal to: IP Technologies Part No. IPTJ-TSIN-01-01 for a custom motion system for reverberation chamber test fixture in accordance with the salient characteristics. Quantity one (1) each.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />Salient Characteristics</p>
<p>Overall<br />The government intends to purchase a turnkey motor control system including design and installation of a shaft and mechanical stirrer (or 'paddle') for use in a reverberation chamber. Said reverberation chamber is already in place. This system replaces a previous generation of equipment.</p>
<p>Shaft<br />Shaft needs to run from the floor to the ceiling of the chamber (a distance of approximately 2.77 meters), and be designed to support a removable paddle. The paddle design will be provided (a drawing is attached), but is only a suggestion. Other alternatives may be submitted. Any protrusions into the chamber (I.e. for securing bearings or shaft penetrations) must be properly gasketed and/or sealed to maintain the RF shielding of the chamber. A bearing specifically designed for RF shielding is preferred.</p>
<p>Paddle<br />The paddle shall consist of 3 sections, each removable from the shaft. The exact design is not fixed, but an example is provided. Drawings of the proposed paddle design must be included with proposal. In the attached example, each removable section will consist of three solid metal plates mounted 120 degrees apart from each other. The diameter of the entire paddle is between 0.85 and 1.0 meters.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED SF-18 FOR DRAWING<br /><br />Motor<br />The motor needs to be mounted above the shaft, outside the chamber. The motor needs to be able to turn the shaft and attached paddle at a maximum continuous speed of 60 revolutions per minute. Acceleration to the maximum speed should take no longer than 30 seconds. The motor must also be capable of being operated in "step" mode; stepping in increments of 0.1 degrees or smaller. A gearbox with a ratio between 10:1 and 40:1 will be necessary to keep the physical size of the motor reasonable.</p>
<p>Driver<br />The driver should be of suitable size for the motor, and require 120VAC.</p>
<p>Controller<br />A two channel controller is required. One channel will be connected to the motor/driver specified above. The other channel must be left open for future use. The second channel of the controller must be able to control a "S-Series" driver and motor (with encoder) manufactured by Parker Automation. The exact model number for the motor is: S/SX83-93-E.</p>
<p>Additional Installation Information<br />There must be electrical contact between the top of the reverberation chamber and anything directly mounted to it (I.e. gearbox). The top of the reverberation chamber is currently painted and will need to be properly prepared before installation can take place. Preparing the surface of the reverberation chamber is the responsibility of the vendor and should be part of the proposal.</p>
<p>Programming<br />Code, in the form of functions or LabView Virtual Instruments ("Vls"), for controlling the operation of the motors (I.e. continuous speed, relative position, etc.) are required to be compatible with LabView 8.6. Programming/control interface from the computer to the controller must be via RS-232 serial (DB9 connection) or IEEE 488 (GPIB) connection. Manual interface/operation of the system is also required. This could consist of a touch screen or keypad and display interface that allows the user to manually enter in commands.</p>
<p>Performance Testing<br />The vendor is responsible for testing and demonstrating the motor, driver, controller and any mechanical installation to ensure that is functioning at the required specifications at the time of delivery.</p>
<p>Site Visit - The Government is planning a site visit which potential contractors may obtain a better understanding of the work required. Offerors are strongly urged to visit this site to fully inform themselves about the location and conditions under which the work is to be performed. Questions will be considered at any time prior to, or during, the site visit; however, offerors will be asked to confirm verbal questions in writing. In order to facilitate site visit preparations it is requested that John Ladbury 303-497-5372 be contacted and advised of the number of persons who will attend. Visitors must be US citizens with a valid government-issued photo ID. Visits must be arranged prior to 3:00 PM on January 19, 2010.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that, notwithstanding any remarks, clarifications, or responses given at the site visit, all terms and conditions of the solicitation remain unchanged unless they are changed by amendment. It is the responsibility of each offeror, prior to proposing, to seek clarification of any ambiguity created by amendment of the solicitation.</p>
<p>The conference will be held:<br />Date: January 20<br />Time: 10:00 am<br />Location: 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305</p>
<p>C&amp;A requirements of clause 73 do not apply. A security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Intercomp Co., of Medina, MN to aquire (2) aircraft Weighing Systems.   This portable and wireless system is currently being used on Air Force platforms and it consists of the following components:  (3) 60,000 lb. Capacity Platform Scales, (3) Two Stage Ramps, (1) Axle Spacer, (3) Tire Stops, (3) 50’ Power Cables (Cart-to-Scale), (1) Transport/Storage Cart, and (1) Technical Manual.  These platform scales use advanced wireless technology and provide a full range accuracy of +/- 0.1% of applied load or better.  They also utilize automatic corrections to improve ease of use and accuracy through temperature compensation, auto leveling via a digital inclinometer, latitude/altitude correction, and auto calibration correction; thereby eliminating the need to perform time-consuming manual corrections.  Each platform is independent with its own digital readout on the side of the platform.  The AC30-60-360 is Factory Mutual Approved for use in explosive atmospheres (Class I, Division I, Groups A-D), EMI protected, skydrol resistant, and water tight.  The Transport Cart is fitted with compartments for each scale and component, allowing for easy-access storage while guarding against damage during transportation.  Each scale shelf within the Transport Cart is hard wired with a charging port so all scales can be charged simultaneously while in storage.  The scales and components are constructed from high-strength aluminum to deliver 150% safe overload protection while keeping everything lightweight and easy to carry.  All calibration is performed via a keypad, eliminating the need for a tuning potentiometer or access to internal circuitry.  Overall dimensions of each platform scale: 34”L x 33.5”W x 4”H / 140 lbs.The AC30-60-360 has been rigorously tested, verified, and validated to accurately weigh the CV-22 aircraft in accordance with the requirements set forth in USAF Technical Order 1CV-22(C).  It is a common support equipment item that is managed and controlled by the Air Force and the only system authorized for use with the CV-22.  Firms that believe they can satisfy this requirement are encouraged to identify themselves.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which may be considered by the Navy in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Navy not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Navy.  Responses must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice.

FAR 52.212-3 shall be completed as noted above and submitted with the quote.  Offerors must comply with all instructions contained in FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items; paragraph (a) to this provision is completed as follows: price, licensure and past performance (Provide a list of at least 3, but no more than 10 relevant (relevant is defined in this RFQ as within the last 3 years) references in which similar services of the same scope and magnitude as this acquisition).  Addenda to FAR 52.212-2:   Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price.  An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in Schedule of Items by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each.  Then, using the no more than ten references supplied by each of the interested contractors and the data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources, the contracting officer shall seek performance information on the lowest priced proposal.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this Request for Quote (RFQ), based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. Past performance will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis - the government will award to the lowest bidder who provides a history of successful past performance by providing at least 3, but no more than 10, recent and relevant examples of providing the same services as requested in the attached Statement of Work.  In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ.  If the lowest priced evaluated technically acceptable offer is judged to have passed the past performance evaluation, that offer represents the best price for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have failed the past performance review.  In that event, the contracting officer shall make award to the next lowest offer with a passing past performance rating.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>STAFFING - The contractor shall provide all personnel, supervision, and services necessary to perform all identified functions related to Air Show promotions and creative services for the Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington JSOH as defined in this Performance Work Statement (PWS).

<p>2. STRATEGIC MARKETING PLANNING</p>
<p>The contractor shall develop a campaign timeline that summarizes anticipated project start and completion milestones that includes delivery of each of the elements identified in this PWS.</p>
<p>3. SPECIFIC TASKS</p>
<p>a. BRAND CREATION AND DEVELOPMENT -- JSOH's current public identity presents several brand challenges, not the least of which is the lack of identity among the general public that the Joint Services Open House is indeed an Air Show. The second challenge will revolve around the official change in the name of Andrews AFB from its current nomenclature to Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility (NAF) Washington, the promotion of which shall not be considered a part of this PWS. However, once established, Contractor on this project must, through the implementation of the brand development campaign on behalf of the Joint Services Open House, develop new brand strategy and or message architecture, for JSOH that is also reflective of the familiar name, Andrews. Such branding will begin with the development of a new logo that effectively communicates both the nature of the Air Show and its deployment at Andrews, albeit under a new name and imagery. All messaging and creative services will derive from these strategies and shall be consistent and impactful against target audiences and achieve agreed performance metrics.</p>
<p>b. TELEVISION COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION - Incorporating the new brand identity created through paragraph 3a. in this performance work statement, the Contractor shall develop a series of four 30-second high-impact television commercials, created in such a way that the spot can be edited on an annual basis through voice-over and graphic changes for reuse in subsequent years with only minor budgetary alterations.</p>
<p>As required, the contractor shall develop treatments and scripts for video productions to support program needs. Upon approval of the script, the Contractor shall provide all pre-production, production, and post-production services including scouting sites, identifying talent, securing releases, negotiating buy-outs, scheduling and coordinating video and film shoots, AVID editing, composing original and securing rights of existing music, providing rough cuts as required, and providing a closed-captioned master and the appropriate number of copies upon request.</p>
<p>c. RADIO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION - With oversight and management from 316 PAO, the contractor shall also create radio scripts to fulfill the needs of radio advertising outlets, most commonly :15, :30 and/or :60 scripts, in addition to any short "live read" information handed to the on-air personalities. These spots may also be used as radio public service announcements and may take the form of scripts or they may be pre-produced commercial, at the direction of 316 PAO leadership.</p>
<p>d. PRINT/OUTDOOR/COLLATERAL CREATIVE PRODUCTION - The Contractor's plan for Air Show promotion and marketing shall include the creative development, content development, copy, design, and production management for the following material elements:</p>
<p>Print ads<br />Posters<br />Flyers<br />Billboards<br />Transit Advertising (including mobile billboards, bus exteriors, bus and Metro interior cards and Metro station dioramas)</p>
<p>Contractor must provide all print advertising intended for transit advertising to CBS Outdoor, Inc.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide at least two creative concepts for all major deliverables and subsequent designs. In addition, the contractor shall provide detailed cost estimates and production options, including price breaks at high volumes, to ensure optimum quality output at the most efficient price. All approved concepts and deliverables will be copyrighted to the Department of Defense/Air Force.</p>
<p>e. WEBSITE PRODUCTION - The contractor will work closely with 316 PAO to develop an informative, high impact, and comprehensive website that will provide a one-stop information resource for attendees, members of the media and sponsors to access and gather all information on the JSOH. The Contractor shall update the website with new or corrected information within 24 normal of receiving information from 316 PAO.</p>
<p>f. ONLINE AND SOCIAL MARKETING OUTLETS The contractor will assist 316 PAO in strengthening its online presence through use of Web 2.0 tools and technologies and outreach to new forms of media. This includes outreach through blogs, search engines and websites in an effort to publicize and promote the event as well as incorporation of social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube and others, as appropriate, to achieve similar goals</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>NOTE - All creative elements, including print, broadcast, outdoor/transit, Web 2.0 and banner advertising must achieve agreed communications objectives against target audiences and geographic requirements, defined as: active duty military from all branches of service, retired members, future recruits, local community residents, Washington DC vacationers and multigenerational families of all demographics seeking education, entertainment, and unique patriotic outdoor events in the culturally rich geography of the nations' capital.</p>
<p>g. MEDIA PARTNERSHIP OUTREACH - In conjunction with - or as a precursor to - creation and development of the advertising plan, Contractor shall attempt to engage in media partnership relations with selected newspapers, radio stations and television stations. The concepts behind such relationships are to make these media outlets marketing partners with the event. Such relationships are designed to generate value-added benefits such as added air time or advertising space, an increased presence on the media outlets website, onsite appearances and enhancements and possible media sell through opportunities. Every effort shall be extended to negotiate such partnerships at no cost to the event, but should the terms of the relationship prove to be of better value to the Government when incorporated as part of a media buy - with said enhancements unavailable without such a media buy - then Contractor may incorporate this element into the Advertising strategy.</p>
<p>h. ADVERTISING - The contractor shall secure local (National Capitol Region) media for direct air show promotion to inform attendees about the event, increase general awareness of the event and maximize show attendance.</p>
<p>Media advertisements will consist of radio, television, newspapers, magazines, billboards, transit, direct mail, mobile billboards, online vehicles, onsite signage and/or other approved mediums and be targeted toward strategically located channels and news outlets, occurring with frequency one month before the event and increase to at least once per day in the preceding two weeks until event completion, or at a frequency which meets desired outcome as the assigned budget will allow. Contractor shall determine the advertising and marketing mix that provides the greatest value and optimal levels of exposure for the Government as possible, as determined by budget, reach and frequency numbers. Total advertising budget which includes all labor, tools, materials, and travel should not exceed $105,000.00. For the purposes of this proposal, Contractor should submit a general advertising plan that shows recommended breakdowns of Advertising expenditures, with such plan to reflect the Contractor's best recommendations for placement of advertising while staying within the limitations of the available budget.</p>
<p>Upon execution Contractor shall submit their recommended advertising plan and attain "sign off" from Public Affairs prior to securing said media. Contractor shall also keep 316 PAO informed about pending and upcoming deadlines - including market trends affecting the availability of advertising inventory - well in advance of such deadlines in order to ensure the placement of all desired advertising.</p>
<p>i. TACTICAL PLANNING AND EXECUTION - The Contractor shall provide project management and coordination answerable to deadlines established by 316 PAO, ensuring the agreed plan is executed on time and within the agreed budget to include media placement, employee expenses (to include communication devices). The contractor shall provide an integrated program approach that includes detailed project work plans, targeted deliverable dates, estimated costs with a detailed schedule of fixed fees or pricing approach, and anticipated equipment purchases and variable costs for approval. Work plans shall be updated weekly. Weekly project reviews must provide detailed progress in accordance with the agreed work plan that highlights anticipated risks, variable costs and potential budget overruns. In no instance shall the contractor exceed agreed budget items without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>j. PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN - JSOH Management organization requires a full-service firm to form and execute a publicity communications plan to inform, communicate and engage the public of the region of the Washington DC MSA persuading attendance to a FREE air show/open house created for their enjoyment, education, and entertainment. This effort shall also communicate specific "news" elements associated with the event, including the message points detailed below. To a lesser extent, Contractor shall secure select, strategic national earned media to increase awareness of JSOH and Joint Base Andrews NAF Washington.</p>
<p>Message Generation to include:</p>
<p>Attendees: Directions, hour of operations, security considerations, parking and attendance instructions, performances (air and ground), list of displays, allowed and prohibited items, and any other items of information.</p>
<p>Members of the Media: Media contacts, approved graphics, biographies, show facts, downloads of 10 second and 30 second video spots, etc.</p>
<p>Sponsors: Sponsorship opportunities, contact details, etc.</p>
<p>k. PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS (PSAs) - Through the production of the television commercials, radio spots and print ads, Contractor shall engage in outreach efforts to secure placement of such materials as public service ads and announcements, taking into consideration both the cost of the event (FREE) and the public services (i.e., military) orientation of the event. If different from the designed advertisements, the PSAs should be tailored with targeted messages for specific, desired demographics or event elements.</p>
<p>l. MERCHANDISING - The Contractor shall if required by 316 PAO provide all material support to include labor and production expenses for the creation of merchandising elements including, but not limited to t-shirts, hats, lapel pins, posters and other materials showcasing the newly designed logo and identity of the event. For the purposes of this proposal, Contractor must outline their proposed strategy and document their past performance relative to the creation and production of collateral materials, in the event that the 316 PAO decides after contract award to incorporate a merchandising element into the program.</p>
<p>m. WRAP-UP REPORT - Contractor shall furnish 316 PAO with a comprehensive post-event wrap-up report due within two weeks following completion of the air show. This report shall include copies of all advertising and publicity materials generated in support of the show (including screen shot captures of on-line outreach and coverage), and screen shots or line item references to all TV and radio publicity hits. While this wrap-up report is due by 31 May 2010, 316 PAO recognizes that it often takes several weeks for press clipping services to provide all copies of articles that run. For this reason, should the Contractor require additional time to complete the report as they await receipt of final items, Contractor must communicate such request in writing to 316 PAO and an extension deadline shall be granted. The Government will not incur any cost for additional time required by the contractor past 31 May 10.</p>
<p>4. PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide references, professional biographies, team member roles/areas of expertise and detailed examples of comparable experience completed within the last 5 years and selected team's proven performance with air shows and large sports or entertainment events with attendees exceeding 75,000. Experience with high level air shows and other localized events considered to be among the most prominent and prestigious in the marketplace is required as is a strong existing relationship with Washington-area mainstream media, including television and radio reporters, editors and assignment directors; newspaper and magazine editors and reporters; calendar and feature editors and managers of "things to do" blogs, websites and newsletters.</p>
<p>5. MANAGEMENT AND STAFF PERSONNEL</p>
<p>The contractor is responsible for ensuring an adequate number of qualified employees are assigned for fulfillment/duration of contract and report completion of all requirements to Public Affairs.</p>
<p>A senior team member of the Contractor organization must be on-site to ensure all program elements are executed for the duration of each event show times of 0700 - 1800 each day (14, 15, 16 May 2010) as needed.

<p>NOTE - All creative elements, including print, broadcast, outdoor/transit, Web 2.0 and banner advertising must achieve agreed communications objectives against target audiences and geographic requirements, defined as: active duty military from all branches of service, retired members, future recruits, local community residents, Washington DC vacationers and multigenerational families of all demographics seeking education, entertainment, and unique patriotic outdoor events in the culturally rich geography of the nations' capital.</p>
<p>g. MEDIA PARTNERSHIP OUTREACH - In conjunction with - or as a precursor to - creation and development of the advertising plan, Contractor shall attempt to engage in media partnership relations with selected newspapers, radio stations and television stations. The concepts behind such relationships are to make these media outlets marketing partners with the event. Such relationships are designed to generate value-added benefits such as added air time or advertising space, an increased presence on the media outlets website, onsite appearances and enhancements and possible media sell through opportunities. Every effort shall be extended to negotiate such partnerships at no cost to the event, but should the terms of the relationship prove to be of better value to the Government when incorporated as part of a media buy - with said enhancements unavailable without such a media buy - then Contractor may incorporate this element into the Advertising strategy.</p>
<p>h. ADVERTISING - The contractor shall secure local (National Capitol Region) media for direct air show promotion to inform attendees about the event, increase general awareness of the event and maximize show attendance.</p>
<p>Media advertisements will consist of radio, television, newspapers, magazines, billboards, transit, direct mail, mobile billboards, online vehicles, onsite signage and/or other approved mediums and be targeted toward strategically located channels and news outlets, occurring with frequency one month before the event and increase to at least once per day in the preceding two weeks until event completion, or at a frequency which meets desired outcome as the assigned budget will allow. Contractor shall determine the advertising and marketing mix that provides the greatest value and optimal levels of exposure for the Government as possible, as determined by budget, reach and frequency numbers. Total advertising budget shall not exceed $105,000.00. For the purposes of this proposal, Contractor should submit a general advertising plan that shows recommended breakdowns of Advertising expenditures, with such plan to reflect the Contractor's best recommendations for placement of advertising while staying within the limitations of the available budget.</p>
<p>Upon execution Contractor shall submit their recommended advertising plan and attain "sign off" from Public Affairs prior to securing said media. Contractor shall also keep 316 PAO informed about pending and upcoming deadlines - including market trends affecting the availability of advertising inventory - well in advance of such deadlines in order to ensure the placement of all desired advertising.</p>
<p>i. TACTICAL PLANNING AND EXECUTION - The Contractor shall provide project management and coordination answerable to deadlines established by 316 PAO, ensuring the agreed plan is executed on time and within the agreed budget to include media placement, employee expenses (to include communication devices) or subcontracting outside services with mark ups not to exceed 15%. The contractor shall provide an integrated program approach that includes detailed project work plans, targeted deliverable dates, estimated costs with a detailed schedule of fixed fees or pricing approach, and anticipated equipment purchases and variable costs for approval. Work plans shall be updated weekly. Weekly project reviews must provide detailed progress in accordance with the agreed work plan that highlights anticipated risks, variable costs and potential budget overruns. In no instance shall the contractor exceed agreed budget items without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>j. PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN - JSOH Management organization requires a full-service firm to form and execute a publicity communications plan to inform, communicate and engage the public of the region of the Washington DC MSA persuading attendance to a FREE air show/open house created for their enjoyment, education, and entertainment. This effort shall also communicate specific "news" elements associated with the event, including the message points detailed below. To a lesser extent, Contractor shall secure select, strategic national earned media to increase awareness of JSOH and Joint Base Andrews NAF Washington.</p>
<p>Message Generation to include:</p>
<p>Attendees: Directions, hour of operations, security considerations, parking and attendance instructions, performances (air and ground), list of displays, allowed and prohibited items, and any other items of information.</p>
<p>Members of the Media: Media contacts, approved graphics, biographies, show facts, downloads of 10 second and 30 second video spots, etc.</p>
<p>Sponsors: Sponsorship opportunities, contact details, etc.</p>
<p>k. PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS (PSAs) - Through the production of the television commercials, radio spots and print ads, Contractor shall engage in outreach efforts to secure placement of such materials as public service ads and announcements, taking into consideration both the cost of the event (FREE) and the public services (i.e., military) orientation of the event. If different from the designed advertisements, the PSAs should be tailored with targeted messages for specific, desired demographics or event elements.</p>
<p>l. MERCHANDISING - The Contractor shall if required by 316 PAO provide all material support to include labor and production expenses for the creation of merchandising elements including, but not limited to t-shirts, hats, lapel pins, posters and other materials showcasing the newly designed logo and identity of the event. For the purposes of this proposal, Contractor must outline their proposed strategy and document their past performance relative to the creation and production of collateral materials, in the event that the 316 PAO decides after contract award to incorporate a merchandising element into the program.</p>
<p>m. WRAP-UP REPORT - Contractor shall furnish 316 PAO with a comprehensive post-event wrap-up report due within two weeks following completion of the air show. This report shall include copies of all advertising and publicity materials generated in support of the show (including screen shot captures of on-line outreach and coverage), and screen shots or line item references to all TV and radio publicity hits. While this wrap-up report is due by 31 May 2010, 316 PAO recognizes that it often takes several weeks for press clipping services to provide all copies of articles that run. For this reason, should the Contractor require additional time to complete the report as they await receipt of final items, Contractor must communicate such request in writing to 316 PAO and an extension deadline shall be granted. The Government will not incur any cost for additional time required by the contractor past 31 May 10.</p>
<p>4. PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide references, professional biographies, team member roles/areas of expertise and detailed examples of comparable experience completed within the last 5 years and selected team's proven performance with air shows and large sports or entertainment events with attendees exceeding 75,000. Experience with high level air shows and other localized events considered to be among the most prominent and prestigious in the marketplace is required as is a strong existing relationship with Washington-area mainstream media, including television and radio reporters, editors and assignment directors; newspaper and magazine editors and reporters; calendar and feature editors and managers of "things to do" blogs, websites and newsletters.</p>
<p>5. MANAGEMENT AND STAFF PERSONNEL</p>
<p>The contractor is responsible for ensuring an adequate number of qualified employees are assigned for fulfillment/duration of contract and report completion of all requirements to Public Affairs.</p>
<p>A senior team member of the Contractor organization must be on-site to ensure all program elements are executed for the duration of each event show times of 0700 - 1800 each day (14, 15, 16 May 2010) as needed. Senior team member is defined as an individual who has knowledge on the project and can operate independently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS/SERVICES</p>

<DESC>The purposes of this amendment is to; 
 
1.	Display the Questions and Answers
2.	Add a Clause
3.	Add an Outline of a Safety and Health Plan (your corporate plan is needed for this solicitation)
4.	Inform that this Solicitation has been extended to Friday January 22, 2010.


Questions and Answers submitted on 1/13/2010:

1 – Are the DI Bottles (SDI Units) that are currently supplied by Siemens leased or are they owned by NIST? 

Answer:  We leased all DI Bottles filters from Siemens. A new Contractor needs to lease them                            of Siemens Company.

2 – In Bldg 227 the Siemens 12,000 GPD RO unit has 2 separate RO systems and one of them currently appears to be broken (Left hand unit looking at them). Will this unit be repaired prior to the contract start or will the new vendor be responsible for getting it working under this solicitation after an inspection of the unit and providing a quote for repairs?

Answer:  It is broken and we need to repair.  It will be a new contract to fixed and service one of RO system. 

3 – In Bldg 227 the Siemens Electro-Deionization Unit (CDI Unit) was turned off, parts removed and the system was bypassed. Will this unit be repaired prior to the contract start or will the new vendor be responsible for getting it working under this solicitation after an inspection of the unit and providing a quote for repairs?

Answer:  A new vendor will be responsible to fix and service.

3 – In Bldg 227 the solicitation lists “Deionizer Units Super 30, 30 Cubic Ft. Type 1 Resin” as being serviced under this solicitation but during the walkthrough all vendors were told that these are under a separate contract and will not be part of this solicitation. Can you clarify this?

Answer:  The Deionizer Units Super 30, 30 Cubic Ft. Type 1 Resin was for reference only. This line will be deleted.

4 – Under FAR 19.1405(a): For acquisitions exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, the PCO may conduct a SDVOSB set-aside competition if the rule of two is met. Since two SDVOSB’s (Pure-MECH and RaSCO) were at the walkthrough, and will bid on this project, would you consider changing the solicitation to a SDVOSB set aside in order to help meet NIST’s goals of reaching the SDVOSB 3% goal?

Answer:  No, the set aside for this solicitation will not be changed. 

5 – In the solicitation it states that Emailed solicitations are acceptable. If a solicitation is emailed will the vendor still have to deliver or mail the binders and copies specified in the solicitation? Will PDF format be acceptable?

Answer:  No, the quote does not have to be mailed if you submit it by email.

6. What did NIST spend on this contract last year?

Answer:   $65,225.00

7.  I have asked our lab about ASTM E-12 referenced in Attachment B as shown below. On line searches do not show any information on this. What specific test(s) are being performed to these standards for this solicitation and where can these standards be found online? 

3.1.2	Performed Water Analysis to Quality Test under UPW

•	Testing to ASTM E-1.2 Standards (2007) (twice a year) and report it.
              Testing to ASTM D-5127-2007
•	Tests require On-Line readings (twice a year).

Answer:  Obtain an independent laboratory analysis, performed using ASTM recognized test procedures, to verify that all requirements of ASTM D-5127-2007 electronic grade E 1.2 UPW specifications are being met.

 8 – The following information is asked for in Section F. Personnel Instruction. This type of information is needed for a treatment program for cooling / heating / wastewater treatment in order to train plant personnel on how to test these systems.  There are very few chemicals that will be used for this contract. And they will be used on an as needed basis (I.E. membrane cleaning, system sterilization as needed.) On RO/DI systems each one is different and will need to have a qualified experienced technician in order to determine the tests needed and the sample points to determine the system conditions.  A more detailed inspection will be needed to give NIST this information. Is this information required with the bid or required after award and inspection of the system? With Section G. Biocide Program , there are no biocides that are fed into any of the systems. They will only be needed if the systems show contamination during the Bacterial Total Plate Counts. This section does not appear to be needed. Can it be deleted? 

F. Personnel Instruction

Provide an outline of proposed training program. The instruction shall be delivered in an electronic format and shall cover, but not be limited to:

1. Fundamentals of Water Treatment
2. Chemicals and Methods of Use
3. Procedures for Taking Samples
4. Operating and Testing Procedures

Answer: NIST request information to find the capacity for the Contractor to provide training of DI Water System in the future.

G. Biocide Monitoring Program
Provide information on instantaneous method as well as dip slide.

Answer:  NIST request information to find the capacity for the Contractor if Biocide Monitoring is required.

<DESC><p>*****************************************************<br />The following constitutes amendment 3 of Solicitation HHM402-10-R-0013. These are questions and answers. The deadline for questions has passed; no more questions will be accepted. The deadline for proposals is 1 PM EST on Tuesday, January 26, 2010. Please email all correspondence to <a href="mailto:Mishelle.Miller@dia.mil">Mishelle.Miller@dia.mil</a>.</p>
<p>**Note that a revised Section L will be uploaded later today, January 14.**</p>
<p>Q24. I am trying valiantly to understand what DIA is looking for Industry to provide in Volume V: Security. We're allowed 15 pages and the only thing I see required is our Cage Code. Could the government please elaborate on specifically what aspects of "Security" it is looking for Industry to provide?<br />Q24. Per the RFP Section L, L.7.4.2 - Contents of Volume V - Security, the RFP states "The Offeror shall provide the CAGE codes for all Facility clearances." Given that there is a 15 page allowance for this section, does the DIA anticipate that additional information will be provided in this Volume?<br />Q24. For the security volume, the Government specifies it needs the SF 328 and Cage codes for all facility clearances. Is this the only data the Government requires or is there a narrative the Government also is requiring? If, so what content is the Government requesting for any narrative?<br />Q24. Is the only information to be included in Volume V to be the CAGE code? If no, please clarify what additional information is to be included and required in Volume V.<br />A24. The Offeror is required to include its CAGE in Volume V Security. Any additional information is at the Offeror's discretion.</p>
<p>Q25. Reference is made to OCI Clause 5.3: Will your agency accept for evaluation an OCI mitigation plan from an offeror? Or, from an offeror's subcontractors? We are looking for guidance in putting together an OCI Mitigation Strategy which would allow us as prime and our teaming partners to continue to bid on other Agency work. As it currently appears in the RFP, the clause suggests that performance on this contract may preclude a successful contractor (or that contractor's subcontractors) from other work at DIA. <br />Q25. Does the government perceive any risk of OCI for a vendor that wins this procurement and is therefore directly involved in a contract management system that includes data on other DIA contracts that the vendor may wish to bid on, or that may be won by the vendor's competitors?<br />Q25. Will the government ask a successful vendor for this procurement to recuse itself from competition for other procurements that will be tracked and managed in the CMS system?<br />A25. In Section 5.3 of the Statement of Objectives, Possible restriction on competing on agency contracts, and in Section I.7 1052.209-97, Organizational Conflict of Interest, the Government addresses OCI. The Government will review a mitigation plan with the offer, but should that offeror win the award, the contractor's responsibility to inform the Government on any possible conflict continues. A submitted mitigation plan is not part of the evaluation process. The Government has no requirements for a mitigation plan for this solicitation. Due to the nature of the work for this Solicitation, the offeror and/or its subcontractors may be precluded from other work at DIA.</p>
<p>Q26. On page 12 of the SOW, in the Personnel Qualifications table, under Senior System Administrator, the requirements lists Solaris 10 certification. Because Solaris 10 is extremely new it is very difficult to find Senior System Administrators who already have this certification. Would the government consider either waiving the certification or providing a grace period post award for this position to get the certification?<br />A26. The Government's requirement is for a Senior System Administrator with appropriate certification to include Solaris 10.</p>
<p>Q27. Section L, Page 1 4.4.2: There are some specific questions regarding Personnel's security clearances that are categorized as sensitive and can't be disclosed to anyone other than an FSO and some contract specific information a contractor simply wouldn't know. Would the government consider waiving the requirement for such information as contract number under which clearance was granted, date of contract, point of contact (Contracting Officer's Representative) and telephone number? <br />A27. Requested information is required by the Government in order to validate security clearance status and for reference purposes. The requirement will not be waived. Please review the new Section L for requirements and numbering clarification.</p>
<p>Q28. Page 10 of SOW: 5.1 Information Assurance Certification. There are several references including this one to DoD 8570 certification but there is no indication as to which positions in particular the government is requiring be certified. Would the government kindly indentify which positions it requires be DoD 8570 certified?<br />A28. Evaluation of proposals includes evaluation of each Offeror's understanding of the requirements of the Statement of Objectives which includes the Offeror's personnel and their qualifications/certifications. The Government will not identify specific positions.</p>
<p>Q29. Per the RFP Section 2.4.3 in the SOO the Support Desk and O&amp;M is currently provided "through a contract that expires in February 2010." The start date for this contract appears to be March 1, 2010. Does the DIA anticipate the incumbent contractor will be available during the transition (i.e. March - April 2010)?<br />A29. The Government will make arrangement for necessary overlap where possible.</p>
<p><br />Q30. Per the RFP Section 2.4.2 in the SOO, "Change Management, Training and PM Support are being provided by Accenture Government Services." In sections 3.1.20-3.1.24, the SOO asks for Change Management support, business process analysis, preparation of training aids and guides. This work appears to overlap with the work currently being provided by another contractor. Can DIA provide clarification?<br />A30. The successful Offeror's onsite TS/SCI cleared Operations Support Team can anticipate participating in change management, business process analysis, training aid and guide activities as a normal offshoot of providing superior customer support. Accenture Government Services will continue to provide Change Management, Training and PM support as part of the CMS PMO operation.</p>
<p>Q31. Per the RFP Section 5.1 in the SOO, the RFP states that personnel must be fully trained and certified to a baseline set of requirements to perform their duties in accordance with DOD Directive 8570.01-M. Based on the timeline of the RFP, the contracting community anticipates that personnel will be certified post award. Please confirm. <br />A31. Evaluation of proposals includes evaluation of each Offeror's understanding of the requirements of the Statement of Objectives which includes the Offeror's personnel and their qualifications/certifications. Offerors are expected to propose and staff CMS Operations Support subject matter experts (SMEs) possessing appropriate education, experience and certifications who will be TS/SCI cleared.</p>
<p>Q32. SOO Section 3.2.2.13 references the Simple Logical Interface Code (SLIC), please provide the Interface Control Document or other descriptive information for this program. <br />A32. Uploaded to this Solicitation are four documents: (1) SLIC CMS Interfaces Summary Short, (2) SLIC Description, (3) SLIC CMS Interfaces Summary and (4) SLIC Quick Interface Overview.</p>
<p>Q33. Per the RFP, SF 1449, pg 2, the form states that "All questions or concerns shall be addressed to Ms. Mishelle Miller or Mr. Nehemiah Pryor only. Any attempt to contact the program office (customer) will be grounds for disqualification." If a current or former customer at the Agency is listed as a Point of Contact for the Past Performance Questionnaire, would this potentially put an offeror at risk of disqualification? <br />A33. You may send your reference the Past Performance Questionnaire, even when that reference is at this Agency, without risk of disqualification.</p>
<p>Q34. In Section L.5.5.1. Section 1 Price Proposal: What is meant by the phrase - "... predetermined and undisclosed quantity of hours determined by the government for each labor category..."<br />A34. The predetermined and undisclosed quantity of hours refers to data contained within an independent government estimate.</p>
<p>Q35. In Section L.5.5.1. Section 1 Price Proposal: is the phrase "...including all options." referring to all option years and only the option years?<br />A35. The sentence is: "The Offeror's proposed bill rates will be evaluated against a predetermined and undisclosed quantity of hours determined by the Government for each labor category and this will be totaled for a composite price, including all options." This sentence means that the Offeror's total price for the base period plus four option periods will be evaluated against an estimate that also covers the base period plus four option periods.</p>
<p>Q36. In Section L.5.5.1 Section 2, does the phrase "...additional CLINs for the government's consideration ...."mean that they are part of the price evaluation?<br />A36. Everything submitted will be evaluated.</p>
<p>Q37. If the offeror does submit additional CLINs based on an understanding of the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and proposed Statement of Work (SOW), can additional labor categories be proposed that support the additional CLINs? And, are the additional CLINs part of the price evaluation?<br />A37. Yes. If the offeror submits additional CLINs, then the Offeror may choose to submit additional labor categories. Everything submitted will be evaluated.</p>
<p>Q38. Can additional services be proposed based on an understanding of the current environment and will these services be price evaluated for award?<br />A38. Yes, additional services within the scope of the SOO may be proposed. Everything submitted will be evaluated.</p>

These key components from EMC are essential to the continued operations of several major systems. They are also required to maintain warranties and for ease of support service agreements.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.

<DESC>This Amendment Notice Number: 0001 supersedes the original Market Survey.  Thelast sentence of the third paragraph has been removed, as it was included inerror.
The US Army ARDEC is conducting a market survey to identify potential sourcesfor Multi-Variable Armament Systems for Manned and Unmanned Vehicles who arealso knowledgeable of Remote Weapon Systems (RWS).  All interested firms shallsubmit their technical capabilities (10 pages maximum) for the above toinclude the following at no cost to the Government.  Costs for proposalsubmissions are strictly the responsibility of the interested contractor.  Todate, these systems are heavy, expensive and the gun systems of these RWS arenot robotized. The ammunition is part of the RWS which adds a lot of weight tothe RWS and therefore expensive heavy large motors are needed.  VehicleIntegration Kits are required for installation of each RWS onto the vehicleplatform.  This effort will allow for the manufacture of prototype newarmaments and RWS components that solve the present RWS problems such asmaterial degradation, weight requirements, vehicle integration, processing &fabrication, jamming, ammo storage & loading.  This effort also includes themanufacture of munition components, projectiles that may transform intoUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) projectiles, platforms in support of lightweightand/or advanced systems or subsystems for manned and unmanned vehicles.

<DESC>The Defense Distribution Center (DDC) has a requirement to provide distribution labor services for temporary, intermittent support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and DDC mission.  The type of services include planning, program management, executing effective and efficient receiving, storage, physical inventory, packaging, care of supplies in storage (COSIS), stock control, stock selection, issue processing, packing, shipping, traffic management support, distribution of material, container fabrication, material processing center (MPC) functions, consolidation and containerization functions, ocean terminal operations, and kitting.  

A contract is required to support excess workload due to surge and Government labor shortages in order to avoid any degradation to the DDC/DLA mission.  Urgency and termination issues are sometimes difficult to address as they relate to temporary hiring of Government employees and the bureaucracy and governing labor regulations.  A contract for labor to support workload surges and distribution contingency operations on an as needed  basis would provide for a “stop-gap” measure for unforeseen, unplanned, situations that the DDC’s current workforce cannot absorb with regular work, overtime, reassignment, or temporary or permanent hiring actions.  This contract will provide labor to support workload surges, unforeseen/unplanned workload, contingency operations and special projects in DLA/DDC locations across the Continental United States (CONUS) and Hawaii.  

The DDC is seeking offerors to perform the above functions which will be evaluated utilizing a Lowest Price / Technically Acceptable source selection procedure. This procurement will be set-aside for a contractor qualified in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, using competitive procedures.  DDC released a DRAFT solicitation on 14 January 2010 and anticipates the final solicitation will be released on or about 08 February 2010. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will result in a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with cost reimbursement (no fee) contract line items.  The labor will be accomplished under the CPFF portion while materials and support costs as well as travel/training/conference costs will be reimbursed under the cost reimbursement (no fee) portion.  The Government may issue a single award OR up to as many as four (4) awards from the solicitation.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to be a one-year base period and four one-year options. 

A pre-proposal conference is expected to be conducted at DDC.  Time and locations will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website. 

The NAICS Code and Size Standard are: 493110 and $25.5 million, respectively. 

All documents to this solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://wwww.fedbizopps.gov/) under solicitation SP3300-10-R-0009.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electric distribution (NAICS 221122), natural gas distribution (221210), water distribution (NAICS 221310), and wastewater collection and distribution (NAICS 221320) utility systems at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA), Texas.  Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §2688 – Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

JBSA is comprised of Lackland AFB and Training Annex, Randolph AFB, Fort Sam Houston, Camp Bullis, Seguin Auxiliary Field, Canyon Lake Recreation Center Area, and Hondo Auxiliary Field.   JBSA consists of approximately 42,852 acres of land, 3,441 buildings and major facilities, and numerous smaller structures.  The population of JBSA is approximately 77,565 persons.  Near-term BRAC related construction of new facilities is over $2 Billion.   

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the electrical, natural gas, water, and wastewater utility systems at JBSA, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government.  Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter “Notice”) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.

Pre-Solicitation Conference 

The Government will be hosting a Pre-Solicitation Conference on Tuesday, January 26, 2010 from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. in San Antonio, Texas.  The conference will be conducted before a Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued. The main objective is to bring together potential Utility Privatization (UP) offerors, contracting specialists, and government program managers, to gain valuable insight and seek inputs from industry on how the government can best solicit the utility systems for privatization at JBSA.  Additionally, the Government seeks to gain market information about the utility industry in the San Antonio area and generate as much competition and interest among potential offerors as possible.  

Contractors interested in attending the Pre-Solicitation Conference are requested to RSVP and provide the information listed below by January 19, 2010 via email addressed to all of the following: John Hildreth, Contract Specialist, john.hildreth@dla.mil; Daniel Ferry, Contract Specialist, daniel.2.ferry@dla.mil; and H. Carlton Dukes, Contract Specialist, henry.dukes@dla.mil:

1.	Company Name
2.	List of Attendees and Titles
3.	Single Point of Contact at the Company 
4.	Company Address
5.	Phone Number, Email, and Fax Number of each attendee

Upon receipt of a Company’s interest in attending the Pre-Solicitation Conference, the Government will provide Conference location details, a draft RFP, and Section J Utility Specific Attachments for each utility system to the designated Company Point of Contact.  

Written Interest

In addition to the Pre-Solicitation Conference, the Government is requesting written Notice responses which will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead no later than 3:00 pm EST on Friday, February 5, 2010.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  
1. Capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; 
2. Financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; 
3. A primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and 
4. An indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government’s use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the April 2010 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office at the address/fax number listed above or via e-mail addressed to all of the following:

The Security Risk Assessment for MeF R3.2 stressed the need for strong authentication and XML Threat Mitigation due to the introduction of Web services to the IRS infrastructure. In 2005, the MeF PMO tasked CSC PRIME to conduct a Product Evaluation and Selection (PES) to mitigate the new XML Threat introduced by Web services and the tool selected was the Forum Sentry XML Gateway appliance. This item was subsequently added to the Enterprise Architecture (EA) Enterprise Standards Profile (ESP) as a requirement for any external Web services implementation within the enterprise. The ESP lists Standards and Products applicable to the IRS Target Architecture and all projects are required to adhere to these standards, using only those products listed in the ESP. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids. The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action. If parties choose to respond, responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency however, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, on behalf of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), announces its intent to publish, in the first quarter of 2010, a solicitation for Tissue Source Sites for collection of normal human tissues. This solicitation will be issued as part of the NCI cancer Human Biobank (caHUB) initiative in support of the National Institutes of Health's Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Contracted Tissue Source Sites will be expected to collect multiple tissues from the same individual (autopsy and/or surgery) and to enroll at least 50 donors over an 18-month period. In addition, proposals should include a small qualitative study of the consent process and impact of the GTEx project on donors and families.<br /><br />caHUB is a new initiative being developed by the NCI Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research. Through an advanced network of tissue acquisition, biorepository operations, pathology review, and bioinformatics capabilities, caHUB will develop the high quality, clinically annotated biospecimens that are essential resources to accelerate the development of molecular-based diagnostics and therapeutics for personalized medicine. Additional information about caHUB may be found at http://www.cancer.gov/recoveryfunding/page10.<br /><br />Normal human tissues are essential to the study of cancer and other diseases. The GTEx project, a NIH Roadmap initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/), aims to provide a resource to the scientific community with which to study the relationship between genetic variation and regulation of gene expression. This project will analyze multiple human tissues from donors who will also be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping. caHUB will acquire normal tissues for the GTEx project through contracts with rapid autopsy programs and medical examiner programs, as well as plastic and transplant surgery programs.<br />

<DESC><p>The due date for responses is hereby changed to 05 February 2010 at 2:00pm EST.<br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION HSHQDC-10-Q-00048<br />14 JANUARY 2010</p>
<p>Question: From the [Request for Information], it is unclear whether you are interested in sensors for detecting IDM, analysis tools for signal analysis, dissemination networks, or some combination of these three areas. Can you please elaborate?</p>
<p>DHS Response: DHS is researching Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) Interference Detection and Mitigation (IDM) technologies which will serve the broad needs of the Department, its component agencies, and other departments and agencies of the Federal government. The Sources Sought was issued to elicit information on innovative and efficient concepts and technologies which would provide DHS with insight into the current "state of the art" of technologies that could be integrated into a Space-Based PNT IDM from a system perspective. DHS is interested in sensors, analysis tools, network concepts, integration and other concepts and technologies for this capability. Vendors are encouraged to provide what they consider the best technical solution for DHS.</p>
<p>Question: If you're interested in sensors, can you provide some guidance for quantity and target price? Would these sensors be able to process and analyze military (Y-code and M-code) signals, or only civilian signals?</p>
<p>DHS Response: This Request For Information (RFI) is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any items and/or services contained in this RFI. Vendors are encouraged to provide what they consider as the best technical solution for DHS.</p>
<p>Question: Can you clarify the extent to which each of the 18 CIKR sectors are affected by PNT interference? Clearly some, such as transportation, are critically affected, whereas others, such as water, are not really affected at all.</p>
<p>DHS Response: There are no prescriptive requirements at this time for the 18 CIKR sectors and vendors are encouraged to provide the best solution for DHS.</p>
<p>Question: Does DHS have access to IDM assets owned by other Govt entities, in particular sensors (ground, airborne, or space-based)? Please elaborate to the extent possible.</p>
<p>DHS Response: The DHS is coordinating with other Federal Departments and Agencies on the coordinated use of existing and planned Federal capabilities to identify, locate, and attribute any interference within the United States. Vendors are encouraged to provide what they consider as the best technical solution for DHS.</p>

<DESC>This action has been awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act(ARRA) of 2009.  In compliance with this Act, the Government posts this notice that TaskOrder NNJ10JB11T was issued under Contract NNJ09JE44C, the Aircraft Maintenance andModification Program (AMMP) Contract, to procure services in support of Phase One of aproject to manufacture four sets of ailerons and associated hardware for NASA's highaltitude research aircraft, the WB-57.	Phase One services to be provided underNNJ10JB11T include: Honeycomb panel procurement and manufacturing; Trim tab procurementand manufacturing; and Leading edge engineering.  &lt;P&gt;NASA/JSC has the only two WB-57s flying in the world.  This aircraft is a 40+ year old,highly modified aircraft used for upper atmospheric sampling and remote sensing. Servicing, repairing, and operating these aircraft present daunting challenges.  The AMMPcontract was awarded on a non-competitive basis because only CSC has the management,engineering, and maintenance organizations capable of working with critical payload,maintenance, and logistical idiosyncrasies of these aircraft.  Formanufacture/refurbishment of the ailerons, only CSC has the unique engineering knowledgeof this aircraft required to review existing drawings, develop wing contours, solidmodeling, and making detail drawings for the manufacture/refurbishment of the ailerons onthe required schedule.	This Task Order was issued under a cost-type arrangement inaccordance with the contract.  A cost-type arrangement is appropriate due touncertainties involved in contract performance that do not permit costs to be estimatedwith sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.  In addition, acost-type contract was selected to provide the contractor the greatest incentive forefficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  TheAMMP Contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate theGovernment's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Recovery Act in the mostprudent business manner, with the time constraints imposed, the existing AMMP Contract isthe most appropriate contract vehicle or the work required.&lt;P&gt;Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  This announcement isfor informational purposes only.&lt;P&gt;All questions and/or concerns must be submitted in writing to the points of contactcontained herein.&lt;P&gt;An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT AWARD THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE:  This is a R&D type contract in support of the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) issued against BAA-09-0001.  Cost Reimbursement contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  The nature of development work often requires a cost-reimbursement arrangement.  In addition, the contractor's accounting system has been deemed adequate for determining cost applicable to the contract and appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.
