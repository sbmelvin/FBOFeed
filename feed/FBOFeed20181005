<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)<br />Solicitation #FA8601-19-Q-0026-SS
<p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contacting Branch, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking capabilities packages of potential sources, including other than small business, small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone) small businesses that are capable of providing a High Speed Spatial Light Modulator as defined in the attached Statement of Work - High Speed Spatial Light Modulator. Firms that respond shall specify their product(s) and requirements meet the specifications provided in the attachment below and provide detailed information to show clear technical compliance. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Note that the NAICS code for this requirement, if applicable to the company's capabilities, should be included in the company's NAICS code listing in SAM.</p>
<p>Detailed Specifications are listed in the attachment identified below:</p>
<p>Statement of Work - High Speed Spatial Light Modulator</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide these items to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 333314 (Optical Instrument and Lens Manufacturing) with a small business size limit of 500 employees; the FSC for this acquisition is 6640. Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard, and indicate socio-economic status (SB, SDB, WOSB, EDWOSB, 8(a), SDVOSB, VOSB, or HUBZONE SB). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. Please provide rationale as to how compliance with these limitations would be achieved, including details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or other than small businesses will be used. Also note that the rules governing affiliation and ostensible subcontracting apply when determining size under the Limitations of Subcontracting, as does the Non-Manufacturer Rule if a supply NAICS code is chosen. Respondents should consider how the primary tasks will be broken out between prime and subcontractors to avoid ostensible subcontracting, and address in the response if necessary.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition, a small business set aside (or other socio-economic set aside), or a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE: All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates their capability to provide the required commodities. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: kristen.miller.10@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "High Speed Spatial Light Modulator" If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xsls or .xls documents are attached to your email. All other attachments may be deleted. Responses may also be mailed to:</p>

The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsible contractors.</p>
<p><strong>Description of the Project</strong></p>
<p>The work include dredging of the IWW within Broward Reach 1 and a small shoal located in front of DMMA MSA641A in Palm Beach Reach IV. O&amp;M dredging will be performed with a mechanical dredge due to the non-uniformity of the shoals. There is not one consistent shoal as we see in some of our more active shoaling areas. Material dredged will then be placed in scows and transported up the IWW approximately 15 miles and placed into the existing DMMA MSA641a. Approximately 50k cy of material will be dredged. <br /><br />The Estimated Magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000.00 and $3,000,000.00.</p>

<p><strong>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The Small Business Size Standard for this project is $27.5 million and to be considered small for purposes of Government procurement, a firm must perform at least 40 percent of the volume dredged with its own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Firm's responses to this Synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages and shall include the following information: </strong></p>
<p>1. Firm's name, address, point of contact, phone number, website, and email address.</p>
<p>2. Firm's interest in bidding on the solicitation as an invitation for bid (IFB) when it is issued.</p>

<p>a. Brief description of the project<br />b. Customer name <br />c. Timeliness of performance<br />d. Customer satisfaction <br />e. Dollar value of the project</p>
<p>4. Firm's Business category and Business Size - Other than Small, Small Business, 8(a), SDVOSB, WOSB, or HUBzone. If your firm is a&nbsp;Small Business, be sure you understand the performance of work requirements for your specific socioeconomic category. i.e. SB, 8(a), SDVOSB, WOSB, or HUBZone.</p>
<p>5. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, firms should address the structure of such arrangements to include Joint Venture information if applicable - existing and potential.</p>

**IMPORTANT:  Please read this full BEFORE responding! **

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is in the process of planning a requirement in which a contractor will be required to provide and deliver Refrigerators for use in VA Northern California Health Care System. Please see salient characteristics attached. 
 
The VA is conducting market research and is seeking written responses with information to assist with identifying potential sources that are interested in, and capable of, providing the requirement described.  Please review the information contained herein and identify whether your company has the capability and interest to provide the items listed that possess the salient characteristics as described.  Please utilize the Market Research Vendor Response Form when responding to ensure all required information is included in your response.  Please note, this request is for market research purposes only.  Please do not submit quotes or offers.  

Set-Asides, Limits on subcontracting, and the Non-Manufacturer Rule
Complete responses to this notice will assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside for the requirement.  Not providing all information requested in response to this notice may result in the VA being unable to determine a vendor potentially capable of satisfying the requirement and, subsequently, if the  rule of two  criteria is not met, a specific set-aside category may not be decided by the Contracting Officer.  To qualify as a small business under a small business set-aside contract, the offeror must be considered a small business under the NAICS code assigned to the procurement.  In addition, the small business must either (1) be the manufacturer of the end item being produced (and the end item must be produced in the US) or (2) comply with the non-manufacturing regulations in 13 CFR 121.406.  

Summary of Non-Manufacturing regulations:
The small business cannot exceed 500 employees;
The small business is primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade and normally sells the type of item being supplied;
The small business takes ownership or possession of the item(s) with its personnel, equipment, or facilities in a manner consistent with industry practices; and 
The small business will supply the end item of a small business manufacturer, processor, or producer made in the United States, unless the SBA has issued a waiver to this requirement.  When multiple items are being acquired, a waiver is not required if at least 50% of the estimated contract value is composed of items that are manufactured by small businesses.  
Additional information can be found on SBA s website (www.sba.gov) and in SBA s Contracting Guide (https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-guide). 


Essential Information Regarding Small Business Set-Asides for Veteran-Owned Small Businesses
VA s Veterans First Contracting Program:  The Veterans First Contracting Program applies to VA contracts only.  VA has a preference to award contracts to verified service disabled Veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) first then to verified Veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs) when market research indicates provides a reasonable expectation that the VA will receive two or more offers from eligible SDVOSB/VOSB firms at a fair and reasonable price.  To be eligible for a VA SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside, the firm must be verified in the VA s Office of Small Business Utilization s (OSDBU) Veteran Information Pages (VIP) database as an SDVOSB or VOSB at the time the firm submits its offer to the VA.  Additional information on VA s Veterans First Contracting Program can be found on OSDBU s website at https://www.va.gov/osdbu/verification/.  In addition, the SDVOSB/VOSB must qualify as a small business under SBA s regulations.  

AUTHORIZED DEALER/DISTRIBUTOR VERIFICATION

Gray market items are Original Equipment Manufacturer s (OEM) goods sold through unauthorized channels in direct competition with authorized distributors.   No remanufactures or gray market items will be acceptable.

LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION

ORDER >SAT

FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
Acquisition Plan Action ID:_ REDACTED

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 4, Lebanon VA Medical Center

Description of Action: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (41 U.S.C. 251 and 40 U.S.C. 501).  

New Requirement to sole source to the following vendor:

Order against:     FSS Contract Number: _VA119-15-A-0019_
Name of Proposed Contractor:
SAN-I-PAK PACIFIC INC.
Street Address:
REDACTED
City, State, Zip:
REDACTED
Phone:
REDACTED
Description of Supplies or Services:
The estimated value of the proposed action is $ REDACTED.
This request is an urgency procurement for a new San-I-Pak waste disposal unit/system to replace the current one that is at the end of its life, which must be replaced in order to maintain/meet safety regulations and protocols. San-I-Pak shall provide the following along with installation: auto-clave series 341L with slide, 40 cubic yard liquid sealed roll off container, 96-gallon trainable dot cart with latches and bio-hazard symbol, 96-gallon cart with lid, single stage mounted cart dumper, two stage cart dumper, special length load platform, weighting system, flared guide channels, machine stand, stage 1/11 cold weather package, and one year quarterly preventive maintenance & bag/liner package. San-I-Pak has proprietary technology for their odor management system and medical/solid waste system. Their system is fully automated, which includes loading, treatment, and discharge. The items exist on the BPA, VA119-15-A-0019.

 (4) IDENTIFY THE AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), (B), and (C) or 8.405-6(b)), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  

 An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

The San-I-Pak system is at the end of the product s lifecycle and the chances of the system failing, grows each day. If the system were to fail without a replacement or fix, it could cause harm to the facility and/or the people on site.

 Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).

A Sources Sought Notification was posted onto FBO.gov, with only one (1) response, and that was from San-I-Pak. No other vendor offered an equal product or claimed that they were an authorized reseller/distributor. San-I-Pak was contacted in search of any additional SDVOSBs and/or VOSBs who were authorized to sell their products. San-I-Pak stated that they had no authorized entities, due to proprietary technology/information they use for their products and systems. They did reflect their statement during the Sources Sought response, about subcontracting work out to another Small Business socioeconomic category, for the installation. 

 In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 

 Items peculiar to one manufacturer: 

 A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)  

San-I-Pak holds proprietary technology/information in the development of their waste disposal system. It relates to the material used and custom development for each facilities system. No other vendor can provide the desired commodities but have stated that partnering up with another type of SB socioeconomic category would be possible.

 These are  direct replacements  parts/components for existing equipment.  

 The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.

The product provided is custom made and not readily available, due to the variable locations of facilities and the desired placement of this system. San-I-Pak holds proprietary information in the development of the product/system being requested. There is already a San-I-Pak waste disposal system in place but is at the end of the product s lifecycle. Each piece must be compatible with the other for the system to work or risk of system failure will likely occur.

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(d) TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  

San-I-Pak already holds a BPA contract that has been determined to be fair and reasonable. If another vendor were to be considered, the Government could be looking at additional administrative cost and the prospect of construction, due to the location of the facility and the placement of the system. The San-I-Pak products were custom made to fit the current placement of the system.  By replacing the current San-I-Pak system, that is at the end of its life cycle, with another, we reduce the chances of construction be needed or any taxing oversight from the Program Office. Including the concern with the age of the system, if the waste disposal system were to fail, it could cause harm to the facility and/or the people.

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

An initial search was conducted on Unicor and AbilityOne using the following keywords: waste, container, cart, weight. On Unicor, there were zero (0) results, but on AbilityOne, out of around a total of 1,000 products viewed/reviewed, none came close to the need of the procurement or could be considered an equal supply/service.
 
Next, a search was conducted on GSAAdvantage. Around a total of 2,000 products were viewed/reviewed, but the results were the same as the previous searches. A new keyword, San-I-Pak, was used, but that too had zero (o) hits.
 
Another search was conducted on the National Acquisition Center, again, using the same keywords as the previous searches. After view/reviewing the products, there seems that there might be some products that could be similar but due to the facility and the locality of where the system is needed, it is too difficult to tell if this is an accurate equal product.
 
To further identify the market and any socioeconomic categories, a Sources Sought Notification was posted onto FedBizOpps (fbo.gov). Only one (1) vendor replied with an interest in the procurement or any additional information and that was San-I-Pak. The vendor did state that for the installation, because they are not a licensed contractor, they would supervise the connections of electrical, water, steam, and drain lines. The vendor would also verify that it is properly completed and that they could provide a "turn-key installation" by subcontracting a licensed SDVOSB for the connection of the utilities.
 
The original product, that needs replaced, vendor, San-I-Pak, was contacted to see if they had any authorized REDACTED. After speaking with the vendor, San-I-Pak, does not have any authorized resellers for any of their supplies due to the proprietary information/trades that go into their products. These products are not readily available, they are custom made to fit the facility's locality of system. The vendor does work with small businesses in relation to some of their services that they provide.

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:

As stated above, though San-I-Pak does not have any authorized resellers/distributors for their products on account that the items are custom made and there is proprietary information/technology that is involved, they have the potential to subcontract the installation (while supervising) to a Small Business socioeconomic category.  

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:

See previous sections.
 

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Research and Development Center-Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) has a requirement to procure three (3) Ruggedized Hybrid Power Systems (HPS) incorporated with government-owned trailers. It is critical the HPS connection boxes are able to connect to a tactical micro grid. As the lead for the Tactical Micro Grid Standards Consortium (TMSC), ERDC-CERL is responsible for meeting the standards defined by the TMSC. In order to incorporate the TMSC standards for hybrid power systems to be interoperable with the Army program of record AMMPS mirco grid, the following standards must be met:
<p>1. Implement remote communication and control of both the inverter and battery management system over Ethernet - TCP/IP, where all available controls and status are accessible via the remote communication protocol - ModBus preferred to work with the original prototype. <br />2. The battery management system is able to be toggled between remote control [controlled via the remote interface] and local control (controlled with GoElectric internal logic for when the inverter is in remote control. <br />3. Provide full data model and API needed to execute controls remotely via the above communication physical interface and protocol.</p>
<p>Go Electric, Inc. is the only vendor found during market research that can meet all the requirements. Go Electric, Inc. has the experience and in-depth technical knowledge of the equipment that is required to produce this product. The company created the original prototype of the device through R&amp;D under the CERL BAA. They have a patented power transfer technology that is critical to the system meeting Army requirements. Their experience with multiple DoD hybrid power programs and their previous work under the BAA makes them the only company who can produce the HPS connection boxes utilizing lessons learned applying the standards defined by TMSC. Therefore, ERDC-CERL intends to sole-source this requirement to Go Electric, Inc IAW FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District will be hosting an Industry Day for the Miami-Dade County and Broward County, Florida, Shore Protection Projects.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will be held at 9:00 AM on 25 October 2018, at the Lexington Hotel, 1515 Prudential Drive, Jacksonville, FL 32207.</p>
<p>Registration instructions for the Industry Day along with the agenda are shown below.</p>
<p><strong>In advance of the Industry Day, the Government is requesting information from industry regarding construction of the shore protection projects. These responses are due 22 October 2018 2:00 PM.<br /><br />The responses received will ONLY be used for preliminary planning purposes. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS Industry Day Notice. </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of Proposed Work</span></strong></p>
<p>The proposed work in Miami-Dade County consists of beach renourishment of 13 miles of beach totaling approximately 2 million cubic yards (cy) of sand. It is envisioned that the work will be carried out in 3 phases. The initial phase will be nourishment of Surfside and Miami Beach Hot Spots limits via quarried and truck hauled material (approximately 500k cy). Phase 2 will consist of maintenance dredging from Baker's Haulover Inlet and sediment complex to include the ebb and flood shoals, and potentially a new Intracoastal Waterway channel with placement on adjacent beaches (approximately 300 cy). Phase 3 consists of renourishment of remaining beach segments throughout Miami-Dade County (approximately 1.2mcy) with combination of truck hauled and construction dredging techniques. Sediment sources for Phase 3 may include existing sediment in the nearshore environment of Miami-Dade County, St Lucie and Martin County offshore Borrow Areas, quarried material, residual Baker's Inlet material, backpassing of existing dry beach material, and/or other sources yet to be identified.<br /><br />The proposed work in Broward County consists of beach renourishment of 388K CY of sand for Segment II and a phased approach for construction of Segment III to place material above the Mean High Water Level (MHWL) in the amount of 123KCY with the full construction template nourishment of 1MCY.</p>
<p>Please answer the below questions so USACE can determine additional means and methods for construction of the shore protection projects and appropriately consider, access, and include new technologies, equipment, and techniques in the scope of the proposed work.<br /><br /><strong>Include the following in your responses: <br /></strong><br />1. Company name, address, point of contact, phone number and e-mail address</p>
<p>1. What new types of equipment can be utilized to back-pass material?</p>
<p>2. What is a reasonable depth for thin-layer extraction from the nearshore environment?</p>
<p>3. How much cubic yardage can be excavated efficiently per day from the nearshore environment?</p>
<p>4. What turbidity controls could be implemented in the nearshore environment to control turbidity?</p>
<p>5. What permanent structures or pipes could be constructed to effectively transfer sand from one location to another?</p>
<p>6. What water based construction operations can be implemented for placement of quarried material?<br />Responses to these questions must be received no later than 2:00 PM, EST on 22 October 2018 and shall be sent to claurice.m.dingle@usace.army.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>The Savannah District intends to award a sole source purchase order for the emergency repair of the SV Georgia to Thunderbolt Marine. The boat began leaking and could not float.

In order for the Government to meet upcoming requirements in a timely manner, this action is necessary. This will result in the Government being able to meet its immediate needs without delays or compromising its mission. The Government will support the proposed actions by written justification and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding. The Government will post the approved justification. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, however, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. All capability statements received prior to the response date and time will be reviewed by the Government and considered. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Should your firm desire to submit a capability statement, it should demonstrate the Offeror's experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government. The statement shall include business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length. Written inquiries may be directed to Amy Collins via email at Amy.L.Collins@usace.army.mil. Response due date and time is 9 October 2018 at 1:00 p.m. ET.</p>

<CONTACT>Thomas M. Pio, Purchasing & Supply Management Specialist, Email thomas.m.pio@usps.gov - Robert C. Ramba, Purchasing & Supply Management Specialist, Email robert.c.ramba@usps.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a Building Expansion project at the Raleigh NC - Northridge Station located at 7800 Falls of Neuse Rd, Raleigh NC 27615-9998. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $2,800,000 to $3,200,000 with construction completion within 335 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. A Notice to Proceed is anticipated to be issued by September 30, 2018 for pre-construction activities only. A delayed Notice to Proceed will be issued for construction activities to commence no earlier than January 7, 2019. Contractors must submit a Qualification/Evaluation Package with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1)Contractors must provide a copy of a General Contractors license from any State, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation. USPS does not exempt suppliers from licensure for federal projects unless indicated otherwise in the solicitation. <br />(2)Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five consecutive years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3)Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4)Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification. An EMR in excess of 1.0 may be grounds for eliminating a firm from further consideration by the evaluation team.<br />(5)Company must submit information for three comparable buildout projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $750,000 or more that clearly demonstrates the relevance of that project to this solicitation, for example from the ground up construction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Qualification / Evaluation Package will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2 of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON TUESDAY AUGUST 28, 2018, AT 11:00 A.M. EST AT THE USPS RALEIGH - NORTHRIDGE STATION LOCATED AT 7800 FALLS OF NEUSE RD, RALEIGH NC. 27615-9998. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Thomas Pio, Thomas.M.Pio@usps.gov or Michael Douglass, Michael.J.Douglass@usps.gov or Robert Ramba, Robert.C.Ramba@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon Eastern Time on September 4, 2018.</p>
<p>Submit proposals via Emptoris, the USPS eSourcing venue. Registration in EMPTORIS is REQUIRED. Registration instructions are attached to this posting. Once you have completed the registration, please email the individuals listed above so an Emptoris invitation can then be sent granting you access to the solicitation and corresponding documents.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place:</span></strong><br />Attention: Nguyen Duc Ninh<br />Deputy Director<br />National Load Dispatch Center, Vietnam Electricity<br />Flr. 8-11, Tower A, EVN Building<br />No. 11 Cua Bac Street<br />Truc Bach Ward, Ba Dinh District, Hanoi<br />Vietnam
<div>Phone: (84-4) 3927 6179</div>
<div>E-Mail:&nbsp;<a style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 7.5pt;" href="mailto:ninhnd@nldc.evn.vn"><strong>ninhnd@nldc.evn.vn</strong></a></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Grantee (Vietnam Electricity, "EVN") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to assist the Grantee on the National Load Dispatch Center Energy Storage Project.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>EVN, Vietnam's state-owned power company, faces significant planning and operational challenges due to the country's growing power demand and regionally unbalanced power supply and demand.  Vietnam has worked to increase power generation and transmission capacity as load demand increases, however, power loss along the long transmission lines and the risk of power shortages continue to increase.  Further, because power transmission and generation capacity have not increased at the same rate as power load demand, both power transmission and generation resources continue to operate at capacity.  As a result, sudden increases in power demand, such as those due to weather-related events, can lead to brownouts or blackouts involving significant loss of load.  In addition, the Government of Vietnam is preparing for the increased penetration of renewable energy to the grid from 0.5 percent in 2015 to 10 percent by 2030.  While adding renewable energy sources helps to diversify generation capacity, intermittent energy sources like solar and wind create challenges for grid stability and management of the grid network.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The TA will evaluate technical issues of the Vietnamese power system including grid stability, adding large amounts of Renewable energy sources, need for ancillary services, etc. These specific technical issues shall be studied in detail, with the intent of identifying energy storage (including both BESS and Pumped storage, flywheels, hybrid arrangement) or an advanced grid support power equipment-based solution (FACTS), and HVDC alternatives.  The selected U.S. firm will evaluate grid-scale energy storage totaling 200 megawatts (MW) to be implemented in a number of areas throughout Vietnam over a five-year period.  The selected U.S. firm will also develop an implementation plan for the National Load Dispatch Center ("NLDC").  NLDC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of EVN responsible for load dispatch throughout Vietnam and will be managing this study and ultimately implementing this project if it is determined feasible.  The selected U.S. firm will assist EVN and NLDC in developing alternative approaches to meeting short-term power shortages and further adapting to increasing levels of renewable energy penetration, while also strengthening opportunities for U.S. firms within EVN.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $755,160 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</div>

In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOVEMBER 27, 2018, 12:00 PM LOCAL TIME (GMT+7)</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</div>

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a separate written solicitation document will not be issued.
This solicitation is a request for proposals (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular [FAC 2005-95, effective 19 Jan 2017].
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541611, with a small business size standard of $15 million.
The Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is seeking the services of a qualified vendor to assist the Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM) in the completion of the FY2020 Lease Budget Model Support. Each year, VA submits a budget request that includes funding for Leases.  This request is intended to cover the immediate needs in the budget year plus one year (advanced appropriation). The Strategic Capital Investment Process (SCIP), as well as leases already in operation and leases in the procurement pipeline, all contribute to the overall budget need for leases VA uses the existing lease budget model to predict the actual budget need for leasing.  OAEM commissioned the creation of a lease budget model and implemented it in the FY 17 budget cycle.  The lease budget model must be run three times as part of the FY 20 budget cycle.  Running the model requires ongoing support and improvements to more accurately predict the upcoming budget.
The contractor shall be responsible for the following: creating and implementing improvements to the current lease budget model to improve accuracy of predictions and functionality; correcting errors in the tool; incorporating the most recent data, including FY 20 SCIP data; and running the model three times for use in the FY 20 budget formulation process and the final lease model for the President s Budget submission. 
This project is a recurring requirement. The 2019 Lease Budget Model Support (GS-10F-0314T/VA701-17-F-0066) was awarded 10/04/2017 to Kilda Group, LLC., of Severna Park, MD.
Please see Attachment 1   Performance Work Statement for project details.
Evaluation of Offers
Award shall be made to the offeror whose quote offers the best value to the government, considering technical capability, past performance, and price. The government will evaluate information based on the procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.106-2   Evaluation of Quotations of Offers using the following evaluation criteria: 
1) Technical Evaluation   The evaluation process will consider whether the proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical features involved in meeting the requirements of the solicitation.
2) Price    The contractor s quote shall include their proposed labor categories, rates and number of hours by task, together with associated delivery dates and sub milestone dates (if any). The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. 
3) Past Performance   The Vendor s quote must include a summary description of at least three but no more than five prior contracts/orders per team member/sub-contractor for projects completed within the last five years with organizations with similar mission and functional domains, and of comparable size, complexity and scope.  These references must also include:
Contract/Order Number, brief description of the project, type of contract, amount of the contract
Contracting Officer s Name and Phone Number, Government agency
Contracting Officer s Representative Name and Phone Number

The contractor must indicate whether they were the prime contractor, sub-contractor or other teaming arrangement. Prime shall indicate which aspect they are directly responsible for of this requirement. 

The Offeror is required to provide references for the above projects.  In the event the company itself does not have relevant past performance, references may be submitted on contracts performed by the Key Personnel of the company.  The VA reserves the right to contact all the references that the Offeror lists.
 
Evaluation Approach
A. All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. However, it may be determined necessary to conduct discussions if award cannot be made on the initial quotes submitted. 
B. All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner. The Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors  technical quotes should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government s best interest.
C. The quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content. Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
D. Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing. An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government. If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.

<DESC><strong>Solicitation Issuance Date</strong>: 12/14/2017<br /><strong>Closing Date and Time for Offeror Questions</strong>:12/20/2017 at 12:00pm Washington, D.C. time<br /><strong>Closing Date and Time for Receipt of Proposals</strong>:01/17/2018 at 12:00pm Washington, D.C. time
<p><br />The United States Agency for International Development ("USAID" or the "Agency") is seeking proposals to enable USAID's energy programs to respond to a broad range of Agency priorities, including post-disaster and post-conflict recovery, economic growth and poverty reduction, regional security, and environmental stewardship for the Bureau for Economic Growth, Education, and Environment ("E3") as described in the attached Request for Proposals ("RFP"). USAID anticipates awarding Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") Contracts (up to eight IDIQ contracts, of which up to three may be reserved for small business concerns).  USAID reserves the right to award more or less awards than this anticipated number or to make no award.</p>
<p>USAID invites all interested and responsible organizations to submit offers in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation. USAID will conduct this procurement as a full and open competition under which any type of organization may submit a proposal. The procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") Part 15 will govern the procurement. The North American Industry Classification System ("NAICS") Code is 541990. The Authorized Geographic Code for procurement of goods and services under any task order issued under this IDIQ Contract is 937.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates that the maximum aggregate ordering limitation for contracts resulting from this RFP will not exceed $500,000,000 over the five (5)-year ordering period. This ceiling is not being subdivided among the number of awardees nor is it being multiplied by the number of awardees. There is no guarantee on the number of task orders that the successful contractors will receive or the amount of money beyond the minimum order guarantee set forth in the RFP.</p>
<p>Upon award of the Energy IDIQ II contracts, USAID anticipates issuing one initial Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee ("CPFF") Term task order. The period of performance for this task order is five years, and the total estimated cost ("TEC') for this task order is between $20,000,000 and $23,000,000. Prospective offerors must submit questions about this solicitation to Matthew Courtad (mcourtad@usaid.gov), Selam Demissie (sdemissie@usaid.gov), and Tseyone Demissie (tsdemissie@usaid.gov) by the time and date indicated above. Offerors must submit proposals electronically in accordance with the instructions contained in Section L, "Instructions to Offerors." Offerors should take into account the expected delivery time required by the proposal transmission method they choose, and they are responsible for ensuring proposals are received at USAID by the due date and time as specified in Section L.  Failure to comply with the submission date will deem any submission unacceptable and it will not be reviewed or evaluated.  Faxed proposals are not acceptable, nor will they be reviewed or evaluated.</p>
<p>The issuance of this RFP in no way obligates USAID to award a contract nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. Award of a contract under this RFP is subject to availability of funds and other internal USAID approvals.</p>
<p>This RFP can be viewed and downloaded from www.fedbizopps.gov.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same website from which you downloaded the solicitation. USAID advises to regularly check the above website for amendments.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>QUALITY STANDARDS FOR EQUPMENT AND UTENSIL CLEANING</p>
<p>Clean equipment and utensils using any one or a combination of the methods listed in paragraphs 1 through 4 below.</p>
<p>1. Prepare food on surfaces that have been cleaned, rinsed, and sanitized to prevent cross contamination. Use cloths to clean or wipe food contact surfaces, table tops or counter tops that are clean and odor free. Sponges shall not be used for this purpose. If reusable wiping cloths are used, rinse frequently in an approved sanitizing solution and use for no other purpose.</p>
<p>2. For manual cleaning and sanitizing of equipment or utensils which can be completely immersed in sinks:</p>
<p>a. Pre-flush or pre-scrape and when necessary, pre-soak utensils to remove gross food particles.</p>
<p>b. Thoroughly wash utensils in the first sink compartment with a hot and clean detergent solution.</p>
<p>c. Rinse utensils in the second sink compartment.</p>
<p>d. Sanitize in the third sink compartment by immersing in clean water maintained at a temperature of at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit for not less than 30 seconds, or in approved chemical sanitizing solution.</p>
<p>3. Tableware, kitchen utensils, and equipment may be cleaned and sanitized in spray type, immersion or other Dishwashing machines. A microbiological plate count of no more than 100 colonies per utensil surface examined in the utensil swab test demonstrates effective sanitation.</p>
<p>4. Handling and Storage:</p>
<p>a. Handle cleaned and sanitized equipment and utensils to protect them from contamination. Touch spoons, knives, and forks only by their handles without contacting inside surfaces or the surfaces that contact the user's mouth.</p>
<p>b. Store cleaned and sanitized utensils and equipment at least 6 inches above the floor in a clean, dry location in a way that protects them from contamination by splash, dust and other means. Clean storage racks with a sanitizing solution each day.</p>
<p>c. Air dry utensils before storage, or store in a self-draining position. Invert glasses, cups, and dinnerware for storage. Use holders which present only handles to patrons for the storage of knives, forks, and spoons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EXHIBIT 3b<br />QUALITY STANDARDS FOR HOUSEKEEPING SERVICES</p>
<p>1. FLOOR CLEANING:</p>
<p>a. General: Clean floors so that no visible dust or dirt remains on floors, mats, runners, in corners, behind doors, or under furniture and equipment. Clean in such a manner that no dust is raised-wet floor method sweeping, etc. Move furniture and equipment as necessary during the cleaning process and replace after cleaning. Do not place chairs on tables at any time. Put all cleaning debris in receptacles.<br /><br />b. Spot Floor Cleaning. Spot clean floors by hand removing, sweeping, damp mopping or vacuuming small areas as necessary to remove food spills and debris. Remove water, sand, dirt or stains caused by open doors or heavy traffic.</p>
<p><br />2. SWEEPING:</p>
<p>In other than food handling areas, sweep using brushes, brooms, treated dust mops, or electrically powered vacuum cleaners. Do not dry sweep in food handling areas. In these areas, sweep with a damp floor broom or brush covered with a dusting cloth. Before sweeping, remove dried matter using a putty knife or other appropriate scraper, than sweep the floor to remove all litter, dust, and debris.</p>
<p>3. DAMP MOPPING:</p>
<p>Damp mop to disinfect the floor in areas where wet mopping is not desirable.. After sweeping, damp mop using cotton yarn or sponge mops, which have been frequently immersed in an approved disinfectant solution and wrung out until damp. Damp mopping removes all dirt, grease, dust, food residue, marks, film, streaks, debris, and standing water from floors.</p>
<p><br />4. WET MOPPING:</p>
<p>Wet mop after sweeping other than carpeted or wood floors using cotton yam or sponge mops. Immerse mop frequently in warm water and an approved disinfectant solution to remove soil. Then rinse floors by damp mopping to remove wet mopping residue, standing water, and dingy, streaked or cloudy areas. Take care to avoid splash on equipment, furniture, walls, trim, doors and adjacent carpets. Wet mopping removes all dirt, grease, dust, food residue, marks, streaks, debris, and standing water from floors.</p>
<p>5. WASHING:</p>
<p>On concrete floors (usually on rear platforms, outside storage areas, and around entrances and exits follow or substitute washing for wet mopping. Use a water hose with enough pressure to remove all mopping or soaking residue. Washing also removes dirt, dust, food residue, debris, stains other than petroleum stains, and residue of mopping or soaking solutions from concrete surfaces.</p>
<p>6. TRASH REMOVAL:</p>
<p>Take out trash when the can becomes full. Keep lid on trash cans. Clean waste receptacles to remove dust, dirt, and other matter.</p>
<p>7. SPOT CLEANING:</p>
<p>Spot clean using the appropriate method whenever extra cleaning is needed. Spot cleaning may be necessary because of unusual or inadvertent events, such as spills, animal entry, blowing sand or dust, pipe burst or clogging, breaking, equipment repairs, or unusual traffic. Spot cleaning achieves the same standards of cleanness as required during scheduled service.</p>
<p>8. DUSTING:</p>
<p>a. General: Use hand treated dusters or treated damp cloths for dusting on other than floors. In food handling areas, substitute damp wiping for the dusting if it is not practical to store all food and to cover food handling equipment and utensils. Proper dusting removes all dirt, dust, lint, streaks, cobwebs, and sod spots.</p>
<p>b. Low Dusting: Low dusting removes dirt, dust, and other matter from walls, structural components, fixtures, and decorations up to a height of 7 feet above the floor.</p>
<p>c. High Dusting: High dusting removes dirt, dust, and other matter from ceilings, walls, structural components, equipment, and fixtures which extend above 7 feet in height. Include venetian blinds, where installed, in this task.</p>
<p>9. DAMP WIPING:</p>
<p>a. Non-Food Contact Surfaces: Damp wipe furniture, decorations, and non- food contact surfaces of equipment using a clean cloth dipped into disinfectant solution or damped with solution from a spray bottle. Proper damp wiping results in surface free of dirt, dust, grease, or other matter and without streaks, spots or water residue.</p>
<p>b. Food Contact Surfaces; Clean and sanitize surfaces to remove food particles, other soil, grease, and cleaning residue after each meal or whenever there is an interruption in use of the surface.</p>
<p>c. Lavatories: Clean toilets, urinals, wash basins, slop sinks, and partitions with a germicidal detergent solution. Scrub with brushes used only for this purpose. De scale toilets and urinals as required. Proper cleaning removes all deposits, stains, and foreign matter, including those under furniture edges, lips and on all exposed surfaces.</p>
<p>10. METAL AND WOOD POLISHING:</p>
<p>After damp wiping, polish with a soft cloth and appropriate polish which does not contain abrasives. Polish metal equipment and fixtures, wood fixtures, and metal or wood decorations. Wipe food contact surfaces clean without the use of polish. Proper polishing achieves a surface of uniformly bright appearance, free of streaks, tarnish and polish residue.</p>
<p><br />11. WALL AND DOOR CLEANING:</p>
<p>Wall and door housekeeping includes cleaning walls, wainscots, doors, posts, partitions, baseboards, trim, jambs, and wall-mounted fixtures. Clean using a damp sponge or cloth soaked in disinfectant detergent solution. Scrub walls in high moisture areas such as dishwashing rooms and lavatories as necessary to remove mold. Hard gloss wainscots or glazed tile surfaces are properly cleaned when bright and free of dirt, mold, stains, lint, and splash.</p>
<p>12. GLASS CLEANING:</p>
<p>Glass cleaning is the cleaning of a glass surface other than exterior windows, glass light fixture covers, and glasses used for beverages. It is accomplished using a damp cloth dipped in a free rinsing detergent followed by polishing with a dry cloth or paper towels. Wipe adjacent trim clean, using damp wiping procedures. A properly cleaned glass surface is without dirt, dust, grease, sport, streaks, residue, and other matter.</p>
<p>13. WINDOW CLEANING (Exterior):</p>
<p>Clean those windows that are an integral part of the outer surfaces of a building. After cleanings, remove all traces of film, dirt, smudges, water spots, and other foreign matter from frames, casing, sills, and glass. Also clean screens to remove dirt, dust, and foreign matter.</p>
<p>14. LIGHT FIXTURE CLEANING:</p>
<p>Light fixture cleaning includes removing covers and damp wiping the covers and the inside and outside of the fixtures. Wipe fluorescent fixtures, including tubes and diffusers, to remove dust and strains. A properly cleaned light fixture is free of bugs, dirt, dust, grease, stains, spots, streaks, residue, and other matter.</p>
<p>15. DUCT, LOUVRE AND VENT CLEANING:</p>
<p>Vacuum ducts, louvers, and vents to remove all visible dust, dirt and other foreign matter. Damp wipe surfaces to remove spots and streaks. Cleaning the interior of ducts or conduits is not included in this task.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modification #3:</span></strong>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q: The Terms of Reference Task 3(c)  states: "The Contractor shall work with the Beneficiary and ExIm to advance an ExIm application for the Project before the conclusion of the Study." What specifically is meant by "advance" (e.g. Is there a specific step of the ExIm Bank application process which should be completed)?</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A: There is not a specific step in the process that should be completed. The Contractor should work with the Grantee and ExIm to move the process as far as possible. As you will note, part of the Study includes putting together tendering documents. It will be important that these tendering documents are developed with US ExIm funding in mind. The Grantee has expressed a desire for the Project to be funded by US ExIm if possible.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q: Task 4: Preliminary Environmental and Social Impact Assessment states: "With the support of the Beneficiary, the Contractor shall engage a local firm with accreditation from the Ghanaian Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation or any other institution recognized by the Ghanaian Government, to carry out Environmental Social Safeguards ("ESS"). The ESS shall address Ghana's regulator requirements for environmental analysis for this type of Project." Is a "preliminary ESS" or a full ESS required under this task?</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A: A preliminary ESS is required that meets the Ghana's regulatory requirements which are more limited for minigrids than for a large-scale energy project.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q: According to Task 5. U.S. Sources of Supply: the Contractor shall prepare  "(ii) a description of relevant products, solutions and services to be provided, along with prices and competitiveness with other sources of supply; (iii) an assessment of the strengths of each potential supplier and service provider for the Project."  This type of comparative company competitiveness analysis is typically done through an official tendering process with clear guidelines. Is there a set of guidelines which USTDA and/or the Beneficiary expects the Contractor to follow in order to ensure a fair and transparent process for U.S. Companies to be evaluated through this analysis.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A: No, although the Contractor for the Study is always welcome to engage USTDA if it is having trouble fulfilling the TOR.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q: Can the Beneficiary provide a list of towns/sites that will be included in the TA?</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A: No. This list will be finalized once the Contract has been awarded.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q: Task 1.(a) of the TOR as well as Annex 6 refer to 67 villages.  Task 2.2 of the TOR states that "A unique load profile must be developed for each mini-grid".  Can we assume that if a mini-grid is comprised of multiple clustered villages/sites, the Contractor must develop only one unique load profile for the entire clustered mini-grid.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A: Yes.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q: Will the Local Project Manager (Task 8) be required to work from the Ministry of Energy office premises on a full-time basis (8 hrs/day, 5 days/week) for the entire 6-month duration of the project?  Or will it be acceptable for this person to work from their own office and interact with the Ministry on an as-needed basis?</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A: While it is assumed the Local Project Manager will spend significant time each week at the Ministry of Energy over the six month period, it is unlikely that they will be required to work on a full-time basis for six months from the Ministry of Energy. The exact amount of time in the office will be determined through discussions between the winning offerer and the Grantee.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Q: Whereas the budget in Annex 6 provides details for the labor hours and rates assumed to develop the budget, no details are provided for the Travel other than stating that "GPTECH estimates travel costs to be $117,000 for this Project, including international flights, per diem, local travel, and miscellaneous costs."  Could we get more details about the assumptions for the number of international trips, US gateway, number of days, and the break-up of the total between international and local travel?</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A: No, this is a lump-sum budget, and the offerer is requested to submit a bid that meets the requirements of the TOR within the set budget. The estimated costs were just illustrative and have since been removed from the RFP to avoid confusion.</div>

<p><br />The United States Agency for International Development ("USAID" or the "Agency") is seeking proposals to enable USAID's energy programs to respond to a broad range of Agency priorities, including post-disaster and post-conflict recovery, economic growth and poverty reduction, regional security, and environmental stewardship for the Bureau for Economic Growth, Education, and Environment ("E3") as described in the attached Request for Proposals ("RFP"). USAID anticipates awarding Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") Contracts (up to eight IDIQ contracts, of which up to three may be reserved for small business concerns).  USAID reserves the right to award more or less awards than this anticipated number or to make no award.</p>
<p>USAID invites all interested and responsible organizations to submit offers in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation. USAID will conduct this procurement as a full and open competition under which any type of organization may submit a proposal. The procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") Part 15 will govern the procurement. The North American Industry Classification System ("NAICS") Code is 541990. The Authorized Geographic Code for procurement of goods and services under any task order issued under this IDIQ Contract is 935.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates that the maximum aggregate ordering limitation for contracts resulting from this RFP will not exceed $500,000,000 over the five (5)-year ordering period. This ceiling is not being subdivided among the number of awardees nor is it being multiplied by the number of awardees. There is no guarantee on the number of task orders that the successful contractors will receive or the amount of money beyond the minimum order guarantee set forth in the RFP.</p>
<p>Upon award of the Energy IDIQ II contracts, USAID anticipates issuing one initial Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee ("CPFF") Term task order. The period of performance for this task order is five years, and the total estimated cost ("TEC') for this task order is between $20,000,000 and $23,000,000.

<p><br />The United States Agency for International Development ("USAID" or the "Agency") is seeking proposals to enable USAID's energy programs to respond to a broad range of Agency priorities, including post-disaster and post-conflict recovery, economic growth and poverty reduction, regional security, and environmental stewardship for the Bureau for Economic Growth, Education, and Environment ("E3") as described in the attached Request for Proposals ("RFP"). USAID anticipates awarding Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") Contracts (up to eight IDIQ contracts, of which up to three may be reserved for small business concerns).  USAID reserves the right to award more or less awards than this anticipated number or to make no award.</p>
<p>USAID invites all interested and responsible organizations to submit offers in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation. USAID will conduct this procurement as a full and open competition under which any type of organization may submit a proposal. The procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") Part 15 will govern the procurement. The North American Industry Classification System ("NAICS") Code is 541990. The Authorized Geographic Code for procurement of goods and services under any task order issued under this IDIQ Contract is 935.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates that the maximum aggregate ordering limitation for contracts resulting from this RFP will not exceed $500,000,000 over the five (5)-year ordering period. This ceiling is not being subdivided among the number of awardees nor is it being multiplied by the number of awardees. There is no guarantee on the number of task orders that the successful contractors will receive or the amount of money beyond the minimum order guarantee set forth in the RFP.</p>
<p>Upon award of the Energy IDIQ II contracts, USAID anticipates issuing one initial Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee ("CPFF") Term task order. The period of performance for this task order is five years, and the total estimated cost ("TEC') for this task order is between $20,000,000 and $23,000,000.

<p>THIS IS A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP)/SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>Proposals in response to this solicitation are due by 4:00 PM EST on Wednesday, 03 October 2018.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract (MAC IDIQ) for Vehicle Barriers Maintenance and Repair (VB M&amp;R) Services to provide all personnel, labor, equipment, supplies, tools, materials, supervision, travel, periodic inspection, minor repair, and other items and services necessary to provide maintenance for Air Force vehicle barrier systems. All Contiguous United States (CONUS) Air Force installations will be required to acquire VB M&amp;R services to include preventive maintenance (PM), inspection, and minor repair for operational vehicle barriers on this contract under a mandatory use policy, with limited exemptions, to be issued after award by the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC).</p>
<p>This acquisition is set-aside 100% for Small Business (SB) concerns/firms including a target of two (2) socioeconomic reserves for Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns, resulting in two (2) competitive pools. Offerors must meet the size standard of $20.5M associated with the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this acquisition of 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance. An Offeror's SB status will be verified using the System for Award Management (SAM) website (https://www.sam.gov). The verification process for Offerors certifying to be a WOSB concern will include verifying that the Offeror is self-certified as a WOSB concern in SAM and has submitted documents verifying its eligibility at the time of initial offer to the WOSB Program Repository (https://certify.sba.gov/).</p>
<p>The proposed contract shall be a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), MAC IDIQ with a period of performance of one (1) base year with four (4) one-year option periods and one (1) six-month extension in accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.217-8. The Government intends to issue a single solicitation and award a MAC IDIQ to a target number of eight (8) SB concerns including a target of two (2) socioeconomic reserves for WOSB concerns. Contract award is expected in March 2019. Task Orders will be competed using the Ordering Procedures found in the RFP's Addendum to FAR 52.212-4.</p>

REQUIREMENT BACKGROUND

Flight Program Operations, Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering (AME) supports maintenance and engineering for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight operations and other governmental agencies that operate aircraft across the U.S. and abroad. Aircraft based in Oklahoma City, OK; Atlantic City, N.J; Washington D.C.; Ft. Worth, TX; Atlanta, GA and Sacramento, CA. The fleet consists of 46 aircraft .Aircraft types include C-90 GTi; BE-200; BE-300; Challenger 600 Series; Lear 60; S-76a Helo; PA-31-350; BD-700. The flight hour consumption is expected to be approximately 18,000 flight hours annually.

The current Inventory Logistics & Maintenance (ILM) system currently used to track aircraft maintenance requirements (i.e. scheduled maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, labor usage and tracking, sign-off history, cost tracking, and document retention). In addition, the inventory, both in stock and installed on aircraft are tracked for base and field locations; purchases and overhauls for aircraft components and interface with operational systems are a part of the logistics support required. The solution must comply with applicable Federal Aviation Regulations listed in section 1.4 and have complete solutions for all aspects of providing maintenance support for a fleet of aircraft. The replacement system will be called the Flight Program Aircraft Management Systems (FPAMS).

This award contains detailed requirements based on the operating methods in use with the current custom system. The FAA understands some of the current methods or procedures may change or vary depending on the solution. Each requirement s will be evaluated to determine of an alternate solution is compatible with our organization. Compatibility with current maintenance requirement intervals, work card management, and parts management is required. This project has a direct effect on FAAs ability to provide aircraft operations services that support the National Airspace System (NAS) safety and the flying public.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br />(Cite authority, e.g., 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(7) or 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(7))
<p>Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.3 and in accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows:</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity. <br />Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Office of Human Resources Division</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or Description of the Action being Approved.</p>
<p>This is an FY 2018 request for Administrative Support Services. The administrative staff shall provide technical and administrative services to include, not limited to, data entry, electronic record management, and data gathering for statistical reports.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>The Executive Services Division is entering into a bridge task order for administrative support services. The administrative staff shall provide technical and administrative services to include, not limited to, data entry, electronic record management, and data gathering for statistical reports. The vendor shall provide contractor support needed to assist the Executive Services Staff, in the preparation of Executive Core Qualifications (ECQ) templates and related documents, under the r&eacute;sum&eacute;-based recruitment method, for applicants selected for Senior Executive Service (SES) positions. These templates will be forwarded to Office of Personnel Management Qualification Review Boards (QRB) for evaluation.</p>
<p>Contractor support personnel must be fully knowledgeable of SES ECQs, the OPM QRB review process, and the development of ECQ Statements or ECQ templates under the r&eacute;sum&eacute;-based recruitment method. In addition, the Contractor must possess outstanding writing ability, analytical skills, and verbal communication skills to work with applicants selected for SES positions. This bridge has been extended from September 30, 2018 through March 29, 2019.</p>
<p>Vendor:</p>
<p>DP George &amp; CO, LLC<br />2121 Eisenhower Avenue, Suite 100<br />Alexandria, VA 22314-5304</p>
<p>Total Price: $158,690.58<br /><br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) under FAR Part 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the Nature of the Acquisition Require Use of the Authority Cited.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)(for USCG) or 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) (for other Components) implemented by the FAR Subpart 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." DP George &amp; Company, LLC is currently providing the aforementioned services under task order HSBP1017J00356.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable.</p>
<p>A Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) notice will be publicized to potential Offerors for this procurement.</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer has determined the anticipated price to be fair and reasonable. The Contracting Officer reviewed a similiar task order for Administrative Support services under task order number HSBP1015J00134.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research.</p>
<p>CBP searched GSA OASIS and found several vendors that can perform the services. <br />In addition, market research was performed on the internet for vendors that can also perform administrative support services.</p>
<p>Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>In order to continue providing services and not having services delayed, it is necessary to contract with DP George &amp; Company, LLC. Although market research efforts identified other firms with the potential to support these services, there would be no feasible way to transition the vendor and present the resources required at this time to commence services.</p>
<p><br />9. A Listing of the Sources, if Any That Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.</p>
<p>CBP conducted market research on strategic sourcing OASIS GSA vendors. Over the past two months, CBP has received several inquiries from 8a and SDVOSB Contractors.</p>
<p>. <br />10. A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required. I</p>
<p>CBP anticipates award using DHS PACTS II Functional Category I strategic sourcing contract for service-disabled veteran small business (SDVOSB) set-side for Administrative Support services. The acquisition is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2019.</p>
<p><br />11. Contracting Officer's Certification. I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>_______________________________________ ___________________<br />Contracting Officer Date</p>
<p>12. Technical/Requirements Personnel Certification. I certify this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate.</p>
<p><br />_______________________________________ __________________________<br />Technical Representative Date</p>
<p><br />APPROVAL:</p>
<p><br />______________________________________ ____________________<br />Contracting Officer*: Date</p>
<p>*NOTE: The Contracting Officer approves: <br />(1) when the action does not exceed $650K; and <br />(2) when regardless of dollar amount, the contract is awarded under FAR 6.302-7, Public Interest.</p>
<p><br />______________________________________ ____________________<br />Competition Advocate**: Date</p>
<p>**NOTE: Competition Advocate approval: <br />(1) is required when the action exceeds $650K but is less than or equal to $12.5M; and when, regardless of dollar amount, the contract is awarded under FAR 6.302-7, Public Interest. <br />(2) is not required if the Component Competition Advocate meets either of the criteria at FAR 6.304(a)(3)(i) or (ii), except for any determination and justification for a contract awarded under FAR 6.302-7, Public Interest, regardless of dollar amount, and exceptional circumstances applying to actions above the simplified acquisition threshold that cite FAR 6.302-2 as the authority.</p>
<p><br />______________________________________ ____________________<br />Head of Contracting Activity***: Date</p>
<p>***NOTE: HCA approval: <br />(1) is required when the action exceeds $12.5M, but is less than or equal to $62.5M (less than or equal to $85.5M for USCG); and when, regardless of dollar amount, the contract is awarded under FAR 6.302-7, Public Interest.<br />(2) is not required if the Component Competition Advocate meets either of the criteria at FAR 6.304(a)(3)(i) or (ii), except for any determination and justification for a contract awarded under FAR 6.302-7, Public Interest, regardless of dollar amount, and exceptional circumstances applying to actions above the simplified acquisition threshold that cite FAR 6.302-2 as the authority.</p>

<p>Additional Notes:</p>
<p>(1) Acquisitions conducted under simplified acquisition procedures are exempt from<br />FAR Part 6. Therefore, this format is not required for acquisitions under the simplified acquisition threshold pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b).</p>
<p>(2) For sole-source acquisitions of commercial items (including brand names) in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.5: Sole-source justifications must be prepared using the format at 6.302-2, modified to reflect an acquisition under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) or the authority of the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003 <br />(41 U.S.C. 428a). The justification must be made publically available (excluding brand name within 14 days after contract award or in the case of unusual and compelling urgency, within 30 days after award). Approval of this justification is in accordance with FAR 6.304(a)(3) or 6.304(a)(4).</p>
<p>(3) For brand name specifications, the contracting officer must include with the solicitation the justification or documentation required by FAR 6.302-1(c), 13.106-1(b), or 13.501, redacted as necessary (see FAR 6.305).</p>
<p>(4) Orders placed under Federal Supply Schedules (including orders under BPAs) are exempt from FAR Part 6; however, limited source justifications must be prepared when restricting consideration to fewer than the number of schedule holders required by <br />FAR 8.405-1, 8.405-2 or 8.405-3 or for an item peculiar to one manufacturer pursuant to FAR 8.405-6. The circumstance, format, approval, and posting requirements are specified at FAR 8.405-6.</p>
<p>(5) For a proposed contract with a dollar value above the simplified acquisition threshold that cites FAR 6.302-2, "Unusual and Compelling Urgency" as its authority with a period of performance that exceeds the limitations identified in FAR 6.302-2(d) or <br />HSAR 3006.302-270, approval by the HCA is necessary unless a higher authority is required. This authority is not delegable. If exceptional circumstances apply to the one-year period of performance limitation at FAR 6.302-2(d)(1), the HCA must issue a written determination regarding the exceptional circumstances in addition to approving the J&amp;A (see FAR 6.302-2(d)(3)).</p>
<p>(6) For actions of $12,500,000, but not exceeding $62,500,000 ($85,500,000 for the USCG), approval by the HCA is required in addition to that of the Competition Advocate unless the Component Competition Advocate meets either of the criteria at FAR 6.304(a)(3)(i) or (ii).</p>

<DESC>The TMIP-AF PMO at Gunter Annex, AL is the primary source of Air Force testing and training of the TMIP-Joint (TMIP-J) suite of software. The TMIP-AF PMO accomplishes software training before the systems and medical provider Airmen are deployed to the theater. The TMIP-AF PMO utilizes both organic and contractor assets in support of the TMIP-J software suite of systems which includes the Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) mission, deployment of systems in support of the war-fighters in theater, as well as for humanitarian missions and natural disasters. TMIP-AF software automates and integrates clinical care documentation, medical supplies, equipment, and patient movement with in-transit visibility. Critical information is gathered on every patient and entered into the deployed system and within 24 hours, records are moved to and safely stored in the stateside databases. <br /><br />The services for the current task order and the proposed&nbsp;logical follow on&nbsp;task order are performance-based and are within the same scope of work. Therefore, the follow on task order is in scope of the basic IDIQ. <br /><br />The CLIN structure for the&nbsp;follow on&nbsp;task order for TMIP-AF Support is detailed below. The task order will consist of three (3) CLINs: Labor CLIN (Firm Fixed Price), Other Direct Cost (ODC) CLIN (Cost), and Travel CLIN (Cost). The Labor CLIN supports the requirement for testing Electronic Health Record (EHR) software releases from the JOMIS PMO and training Air Force, AF reserves, and Air National Guard medical war-fighters on the loading and use of the TMIP-AF software in theater. The ODC CLIN covers other costs that occurs in support of the TMIP-AF mission. The Travel CLIN supports the required travel for contractors to Air Force and other installations where the EHR training occurs. The CLIN structure and numbering convention is dictated by the structure of the NETCENTS-2 IDIQ.
