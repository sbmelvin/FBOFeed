<DESC>Joint Contracting Command-Iraq/Afghanistan, PARC FORCES, intends to issue a commercial firm-fixed priced multiple award IDIQ solicitation for polling support and focus groups.  Since the end of major combat operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Coalition Forces have sought to build robust and positive relations with the people of Iraq and to assist the Iraqi people in forming a new government.  As such, it is important to understand Iraqi public perception and opinion.  One way of determining public opinion is through a multi-component research program involving surveys and focus groups. Surveys and focus groups have become widely used and acknowledged research methods and are important tools for assessing changes in the level of a population?s support for various groups. Surveys allow you to assess the effectiveness of operations as they relate to gaining and maintaining popular support. Focus Groups are designed for testing messages to influence or communicate with certain audiences.  They can identify creative and innovative ideas related to the subject of interest.  Both methods can also be used to obtain background information about a subject to formulate specific research questions or to formulate hypotheses for subsequent use.  

The following draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and questions are being asked by Joint Contracting Command-Iraq/Afghanistan to interested parties to assist us in developing a sound PWS for solicitation and subsequent award for our polling and focus group requirements.   

1.	Is your firm interested in this requirement?

2.	If your company is not interested in this requirement based on the draft Statement of Work, what changes, if any would encourage your firm to participate in this acquisition.

3.	What Statement of Work revisions would you make if you had the chance?

4.	Is the mobilization schedule depicted in the Statement of Work achievable in Iraq?  In not, please explain.

5.	What are the challenges or difficulties that have not been adequately addressed or mitigated by the statement of work or solicitation?

6.	What solicitation CLIN structure would you recommend?

Response to this Request for Information should be directed to MSgt Wendell Crittenden electronically at: wendell.crittenden@iraq.centcom.mil, not later than 2359 Baghdad time on 29 Sept 2006.

<SUBJECT>--Brand Name Solicitation for Shavlik Software
<DESC>This notice is posted as an intent to award contract for commercial items.  The items required under this contract will be deemed brand name in nature in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.211-6 - Brand Name or Equal.  This notic e is not a request for competitive quotations, but a notice of the Governments intent to procure the following items:  SKNP-NP5XC-PPL Shavlik NetChk Protect 5x: Quantity required --1000 each, SKTS-NPST-SUB Shavlik Standard Tech Support for NetChk: Quantit y required --1000 each. JUSTIFCATION FOR INSCOMs PROCUREMENT OF BRAND NAME OR EQUAL items listed above: a.	Functionality:  1st IOC requires procurement of Shavlik patch management remediation tool.  Due to the increased responsibility to patch machines quicker and with less administrative overhead. In addition to seamless patch management, Shavlik also detec ts and removes Malware, Spyware and malicious code that is responsible for increased bandwidth usage and data mining that compromises the security of networks. b.	Hardware:  This product is name brand specific by manufacturer part number and cannot be substituted due to application and hardware compatibility requirements.  c.	Maintenance: With the increase of operating system vulnerabilities, rising threat from SpyWare and the reduction of trained staff, the use of Shavlik" SpyWare and Patching tool will allow the1st IO Cmd to centralize and streamline the Patch Management a nd SpyWare remediation into one easy to use console.  This will dramatically reduce the need to utilize excessive training dollars due to the intuitive and simple to use Graphic User Interface console. The ability to patch, remediate malware, protect our n etwork resources and produce accurate compliancy reports from one console provides the 1st IO CMD an unprecedented level of efficiency in the war on network security. This product will allow our staff to utilize a minimal amount of man hours on Patch Manag ement while providing a marked increase in productivity. Our networks will be easier to manage, compliant with the Armys Information Assurance plan and more hardened to outside attacks and vulnerabilities. In addition, the ability to centrally manage all hardware and devices on the network will streamline life cycle replacement, and ultimately reduce costs. d.	Compatibility:  Currently, 1st IO Cmd has no tool available that is capable of patching non-Microsoft 3rd Party Software. (SMS) Systems Management Server and Update Expert only support Microsoft patches. When IAVAs require patching for Adobe, Macromedi a, Java, QuickTime, Oracle, and RealPlayer, we are unable to effectively remediate using (SMS) Systems Management Server or Update Expert. Shavlik Netchk Pro addresses this problem by fully supporting non-MS 3rd party patching.  Therefore, no substitution is acceptable.   e.	This requirement is being accomplished via Veteran Service Disabled 8a competition. Although the intent of this notice is not to solicit competitive quotations, interested sources are not precluded from identifying their interest and capability to respo nd to this requirement via e-mail to: xavier.hernandez@us.army.mil.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure support requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.IRM/OPS/MSO/MSP has identified the HP/Compaq DL 360 and 380 servers as key components of its hardware support infrastructure. Equipment listed above is already in wide use to support the OpenNet Everywhere and Blackberry Enterprise Server programs’ applications and associated data.  Hardware components are hot-swappable between servers, which allows for across-the-board standardization and standardization of server configuration. This in turn results in fiscal savings as parts, rather than whole servers, can be replaced as necessary/on demand.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet MSP’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s OpenNet Everywhere and Blackberry Enterprise Server application(s) and associated data hardware support infrastructure. The HP/Compaq DL 360 and DL 380 servers have undergone test and assessment evaluation for hardware infrastructure installation and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board A)	Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY. NO COMPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED.

C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY. NO COMPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server have been identified as key components of the Department’s networking system, with optimal server configurations to meet CA/CST/VCS’ Diversity Immigrant Visa Information System (DVIS) project’s needs.  Currently CA is upgrading the OS and Oracle in preparation for the next releases of DVIS 05.03.00; therefore, this is an opportune time to refresh the DVIS server environments with the new servers.  The HP ML570 G3 meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: ·	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health. ·	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks. ·	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives. ·	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers. ·	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) ·	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting. ·	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives. ·	Systems must have front video/USB ports. ·	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources. ·	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

RM/DCFO/GFMS requires an expansion to its existing development environment in SA15 in Roslyn, VA to accommodate the increased amount of development required to support the implementation of GFMS.  The GFMS project requires the following: -	 1 high speed laser jet printers (4 tray 500 sheet feeder) -	 8 mid level ink jet printers -	15 21inch LCD monitors All of this equipment would be housed in SA15 and integrated with the existing SA15 network.  SA15 must support Washington based development activities in a consolidated network.  As a result, each layer of the network’s technical architecture has been designed with high availability and redundancy in mind. Identical HP printers and View Sonic monitors are fully configured to be utilized and to backup other similar equipment in the event of hardware failure. Likewise, each layer of the architecture must work seamlessly with itself. This means that a network equipment component layer must be not only compatible, but have the same performance, and operations characteristics so as not to introduce performance anomalies.  Industry Data Both State and USAID have an extensive investment in HP printer technology. HP printers are used by State and USAID for the current production operations throughout SA15 and the Charleston Financial Center.  The Impact of Not Requiring Brand Name The RM bureau also has an extensive installed base of HP printers and bulk orders toner cartridges for these as well as providing common maintenance technicians. To introduce additional supply inventories would defeat the savings achieved through these bulk orders. Recommendation HP printers and View Sonic monitors are available on a number of GSA schedules.  Based on the current production installed base of HP printers and workstations and the critical need for the GFMS to stay consistent with their network configurations, RM recommends the acquisition (Brand Name Justification) of HP printers and View Sonic monitors for SA15 in Roslyn.

<DESC>Requirement: 4 HP DL380G5 Servers





Brand Name Justification


1. Hewlett-Packard Servers are the only servers available able to meet our requirements in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c). The 88th Communications Group is standardized on Hewlett Packard Storage Area Network as the backup for memory and data storage for the File and Print applications that are supported by 88 CG. Other SANSs are capable of providing the mirroring of data and storage needs but, we currently have HP SANs and the replacement of them is significantly eased due to lack of change in the infrastructure because it?s the same vendor. The price of this acquisition is approx. $*****.

2.  This procurement will not be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(11); however it is policy to post the brand name justification on FBO.
3. 88 CG will continue to monitor the market to determine the existence of other potential sources/supply that can meet their requirement.
4. Therefore it is hereby determined that the HP servers are the only servers able to meet the governments? requirements for this procurement.

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. Delivery shall be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of Dell PowerEdge 2850 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements and the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ systems environment and visa generation requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another manufacturer or company. CA/CST has identified the Dell PowerEdge 2850 Servers as the optimal mid-sized platform to meet the inventory needs of Domestic Operations Infrastructure Support Services.  The introduction and use of dual core technology is deemed essential to the successful conduct of the Technical Briefing Lab as it is the most cost effective means of enabling the Bureau to increase processing speeds by more than 50%.  The processors will provide extra caching capabilities and the additional memory will enhance the Bureau’s ability to maintain operational status in the event of unexpected memory failures.  The Dell PowerEdge servers w/dual core Intel Xenon processor and Blade servers were judged to offer the most power and redundancy of any server of its class, and was determined to be best suited to support the Technical Briefing Lab. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements. The recent request to migrate all NT servers to 2003 and other application requirements has consumed Domestic Operations Infrastructure Support Services current server inventory, therefore requiring them to ask for additional server hardware.  In order to meet their current operational requirements, and with the delay in the install of drops and power to the Technical Briefing Lab, all the requested equipment is necessary to replace the Technical Briefing Lab’s current servers. The Dell server equipment was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureau’s Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and is being added to the Consular HW Baseline.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS Purchase of Analyst Notebook and Analyst Notebook Training:  The Chief Technology Office has been tasked by Diplomatic Security (DS) to provide analytical tools to offices performing threat analysis, intelligence, and counterintelligence. The tool that will be utilized by the Bureau is an industry standard known as Analyst Notebook. Concurrent user licensees and training are being procured to ensure that personnel supporting the Mission of the Bureau have the proper tool and training to provide a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.DS/CTO/CPA has identified Analyst Notebook as a key component that enables our personnel to automate the analysis of threat and intelligence information. Analyst Notebook is a necessary technology for gathering, providing access to, and analyzing data for the purpose of helping enterprise users make better and more efficient decisions. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2). The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. As this is a sole source justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s analysis function.It is also important to note that the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Department has been using this tool (Analyst Notebook) for approximately 10 years.  Analyst Notebook is the Bureau’s “standard” tool for automated analysis of information. DS/EX/CTO has conducted a market survey to determine if any commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Investigative Analysis Software Tools, e.g., Analytical Tools, could satisfy DS requirements. Seven organizational entities within DS participated in the market survey by defining their requirements for Analytical Tools, evaluating vendor product descriptions, constructing benchmark test cases, evaluating vendor product performance and capabilities based on results obtained for the benchmark test cases, and identifying the vendor whose COTS products best satisfied their needs. Thirty-five (35) candidate vendors were identified as having COTS products of potential interest and were provided with a statement of the DS requirements. Eighteen (18) of these candidate vendors responded and were asked to use their tools to perform the benchmark test cases. Fourteen (14) of the vendors provided the result obtained for the benchmark test cases using their tools. These results were evaluated by DS and nine (9) vendors were asked to demonstrate their tools. Based on their evaluation of the product description, benchmark performance, and product demonstrations, DS/EX/CTO, which was one of the participating organizational entities, determined that certain of the COTS Analytical Tools available from i2 Inc. were the most appropriate for satisfying their needs.

(84 lbs.), Overall Length 1654mm (65.1 in), Barrel length – 1143mm (45.0 in), Bore characteristics – hard chrome line, 8 grooves, Twist and direction – 381mm (15.0 in), right hand, method of operation – short recoil; direct system; locking bolt, muzzle velocity – 2900 ft/sec (920 m/sec), muzzle energy – 16,649 joule, effective range – 18500m (± 6,000 ft), front sight – fixed, rear sight – rear sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation to 2500m, cyclic rate of fire – 450-550 rpm, fire control selection – SAFE-SEMI-FULL AUTO. 4.

A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

Without the weapons and accessories requested, the Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide the proper level of security and protection.  The M2HB, M240B and M249 Para’s are unique systems that our armorers have been certified to repair, and that the agents have been trained to use.  All agents must be able to pick up a weapon and use it, not just the one they were trained on, and this becomes a legal liability issue.  The U.S. Department of State cannot utilize multiple systems for our weapons for the above reasons.9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.  The weapons requested are what the agents were trained to use during their initial training as Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent Training.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons systems to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.  FNH, Inc. is the only manufacturer of the M2HB, M240B and the M249 Para. These items are needed by December 29, 2006.  If cannot met delivery requirement, do not bid.

Bids must be valid for 30 days after close of competition. No Exceptions or Qualifications. It is required that the M4 Carbine and M4 magazines be purchased to support the training for agents who will be assigned to missions which could come up at any time.  This will enable DEAV to furnish the agents with the magazines and weapons they need to provide continued protection for personnel overseas.  Additionally, continued safe travel and protected movement is required for high level U.S. Embassy and Consulate officials while travelling overseas, and for Ambassador level officials serving in international organizations working to restore and maintain economic and social stability.   The M4 Carbine is the weapon that all agents are issued once they go through BSAC.  The M4A1 Carbine has been approved by the FPRB for issuance to all State Department personnel and contractors.  The Colt M4 30 round magazine is the only magazine authorized by Colt for Government and law enforcement use.  A weapon malfunction caused by a magazine made by any other manufacturer than Colt for the M4 will void Colt’s warranty.  Other magazines manufactured by after market companies will not function as reliably as a 30-round Colt magazine in a Colt M4 rifle.  The Colt 30-round magazine is designed to work with the M4 and is manufactured under Department of Defense contracts.  There are other magazines that are marketed for civilian target shooters and are not designed for the hard usage law enforcement or Government missions frequently encounter.  The Colt M4 is utilized all over the world as Diplomatic Security missions dictate, an unreliable, after-market magazine of dubious quality and functionality cannot be used.  Colt M4 30-round magazines are the only magazines authorized for use with the M4 rifles that we currently distribute to agents.The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2).  The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-2, Sole Source Justification. Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has a broad range of responsibilities that include protection of personnel and facilities, both domestic and abroad.  Without the magazines and weapons requested, The Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide special agents the support that is required for continued and uninterrupted protection.  The magazine and weapon that has been requested are the same magazines and weapons that are issued to all of the existing agents currently in the field.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons and magazines to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The M4 Carbine and magazine described above are to be utilized by Special Agents assigned to missions and posts overseas.  It is imperative that the agents receive the same equipment on this assignment that they are trained on, so when faced with an unsettled condition they are able to provide the protective services required.  The vendor states that this item has a lead-time of 30 days, but it is crucial that this be treated as Sole Source since the vendor supplies genuine Colt items.  DS has verified that the request as described represents the government’s minimum requirements.Without the COLT weapon repair parts and tools requested, the Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide special agents the equipment they are trained on which is required for continued and uninterrupted protection.  The weapon repair parts and tools described in paragraph 3 are currently being utilized for the Karzai Protective Operation. The weapons and accessories have been requested for the agents who were trained on the use of the M4 and the M203, and are given to all of the existing agents currently in the field.  The weapons and magazines requested are needed to equip the agents on what they will be expected to use once they arrive in Baghdad, Iraq.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents and DEAV armorers in the field including purchasing all new weapons to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.
