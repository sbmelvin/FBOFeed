<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)’s Office of New Reactors (NRO) serves the public interest by enabling the safe, secure, and environmentally responsible use of nuclear power in meeting the nation's future energy needs.  NRO’s Division of New Reactor Licensing (DNRL) supports the NRO mission to protect public health, safety, and the environment by leading and managing the activities associated with the licensing of new nuclear power plants.  These activities include planning and scheduling, infrastructure development, environmental and safety reviews and project management of new reactor activities in support of licensing, oversight, and rulemaking programs for new reactors.   DNRL is responsible as the project management organization for design certification (DC) application reviews, early site permit (ESP) application reviews, combined operating license (COL) application reviews, and new reactor pre-application activities.  DNRL develops and maintains the necessary regulatory infrastructure to support new reactor licensing activities, including rulemaking, guidance development, interaction with stakeholders on issues pertaining to new reactors, large-scale project management tools, schedule and resource planning and tracking, and issuance of design certifications, early site permits, and combined operating licenses. 

NRO anticipates the filing of more than 19 COL applications in the next several years and the number is growing.  As a result, substantial assistance will be needed by NRO staff to prepare for and review these applications.  NRO is currently developing the infrastructure needed to review this growing number of new reactor applications.  Technical assistance resources will need to be identified, coordinated, and managed to review these applications in a timely manner.  Given this increased workload in new reactor licensing and importance of meeting the schedule of new reactor licensing activities, NRC is seeking Contractor assistance in the preparation and review of these simultaneous applications.   The Contractor(s) shall provide qualified, competent, and fully trained personnel to perform the required technical support activities.

The Contractor(s) shall provide support in a wide range of technical and scientific disciplines in accomplishing work related activities aimed at ensuring the overall safety and adequacy of nuclear power plant design, construction, and operations.  Work related activities include design certification, early site permits, combined operating license and pre-application activity.    The scope of work involves placement of task orders in program areas such as DCs, ESPs, COLs and pre-application activity.  
 
The NRC has developed a strategy, referred to as the Design-Centreed Review Approach (DCRA) and referenced in the Regulatory Issue Summary 2006-06, “New Reactor Standardization Needed to Support the Design-Centreed Licensing Review Approach.”  DCRA is based on a concept of industry standardization of COL applications referencing a particular design (e.g., COL applications referencing either the Advanced Plant 1000 (AP1000), Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR), Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) or Evolutionary Power Reactor (EPR) reactor designs).  This approach uses, to the maximum extent practical, a “one issue, one review, one position” strategy in order to optimize the review effort, the resources needed to perform these reviews, and the review schedules.  One technical review will be conducted for each reactor design issue and use of this one decision will support the decision on a DC and on multiple COL applications.  In order for the DCRA to be fully effective, it is paramount that the Design Certification and COL applicants achieve a consistent level of standardization among related COLs.  The contract awards for this technical assistance will be allotted along new reactor designs consistent with the DCRA (e.g., AP1000, ESBWR, EPR, ABWR).  


It is anticipated that this requirement will result in up to four contract awards, one for each of four reactor design centers.  One of the four awards will be a small business set aside.  

It is anticipated that the contracts will be cost reimbursement type contracts.   

The period of performance of the resultant contract will be five (5) years. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about April 16, 2007 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services from Texas Tech University, on a sole source basis.

Professional services are required over a 12-month period to develop public algorithms and create open source implementations of these algorithms for segmenting biomedical images by image content to support Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) of bio medical images for the National Library of Medicine (NLM). As part of NLM R& D work to create a Content-Based Image Retrieval System for 
bio medical images, research and development is required to develop techniques to efficiently index       these images by image content such as texture and shape. In order to index images by contents of regions within the images, segmentation of those regions is required. The work done under this procurement will implement methods to interactively segment biomedical images by texture, develop and implement techniques for shape segmentation in images that have bifurcated boundaries (such as the superior and inferior faces of lumbar spine images), grow the size of the NLM spine image segmentation library, and carry out initial research and development into hosting compute-intensive parts of the shape segmentation algorithms on commercial off-the-shelf graphics processing hardware.

Proposed Work: (1) develop an interactive texture segmentation tool, generalizing concepts implemented in Mortensen?s intelligent scissors approach; (2) develop improved and validated  methods to segment shapes in biomedical images that include bifurcated paths; (3) grow the size of the NHANES II shape segmentation library; and (4) conduct research and development into the implementation of image indexing algorithms on consumer-level graphics processing units (GPUs).

Texas Tech is uniquely qualified for this work because of the expertise and experiences of the principal investigator (Dr. Sari-Sarraf) in the specific area of image segmentation combined, with his extensive educational background and research experience in advanced image processing and numerous other technical publications, and the support of the facilities and staff of the Texas Tech Applied Vision Laboratory (AVL). Dr. Sari-Sarraf  has been the principal investigator for all segmentation methods that are the focus of research and development for the proposed procurement work.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Corning Fiber Optic Unicam Connectors, Fiber Optic Adapter Panels, and Rack Mount Enclosures.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure distribution requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Corning Fiber Optic Unicam Connectors, Fiber Optic Adapter Panels, and Rack Mount Enclosures as key components of the Department’s network cabling distribution system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network cabling distribution to existing Department of State network cabling distribution systems based on compatibility (size, color, fit, etc) with existing, compatible Corning Fiber Optic Unicam Connectors, Fiber Optic Adapter Panels, and Rack Mount Enclosures presently installed at U.S. Foreign Missions worldwide and currently in stock in the ITL warehouse.   The Installations Branch currently has Corning products in stock and requires the same name brand to maintain distribution system integrity, and standardization of warehouse, bill of materials, and installation management. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s network distribution system. The Corning Fiber Optic Unicam Connectors, Fiber Optic Adapter Panels, and Rack Mount Enclosures are necessary for seamless integration and installation to existing fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures within the Department’s network cabling distribution systems.  Using other brand name fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures would require restocking the warehouse with the same other brand fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures and subsequent replacement of the entire warehouse stock of existing compatible items.  Simple one-for-one replacements or additions as needed would not be practical as it may entail a completely new cabling distribution system at one or more locations. Installation teams also have connector installation kits that are compatible only with the Corning Unicam Fiber Optic SC-type connectors.  The requested acquisition is to replenish warehouse stock and is based on compatibility with existing warehouse stock and installation tool kits and methods.<BR><BR>

As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to provide unique capabilities that are not available in a single package from competing vendors. The Patch Management Team lab is designed to support the basic patch package development but is currently operating at capacity.  The VMware Lab Manager provides a set of capabilities not available in another single competing product.    The basic VMware Workstation product is already used by the Patch Management Team for testing and package development, but has limited capabilities.  The Lab Manager product builds on the Patch Team's existing virtual lab environment.  It will provide greatly enhanced testing capabilities by allowing for rapid testing of multiple platform configurations and easy sharing of virtual environments between team members.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Funding Opportunity Description The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) receives funds for implementation of the Yukon River Salmon Agreement reached with Canada in March 2001.  The Yukon River Salmon Act of 2000 authorizes funds for implementation of the Agreement including funds for cooperative research and management projects on the Yukon River in Alaska.  The Service administers these funds through grant agreements, purchase orders, and contracts on a competitive basis for projects/studies that advance the scientific community's understanding of and management of Chinook and chum salmon in the Yukon River in Alaska.  This is a call for initial project proposals of one year in length.  Successful applicants will be asked to submit detailed proposals.   The initial project proposals will be evaluated by the U.S. Section of the Yukon River Panel (Panel).  Authors of selected initial proposals will be notified by the Service to submit detailed proposals for final review.  The Panel reserves the right to ask questions for clarification and conduct negotiations with promising proposal authors prior to final selection. The Panel reserves the right to eliminate from consideration any proposals whose author does not provide clarification in a timely manner, if and when clarification is sought.  Panel recommendations on project selections will be forwarded to the Service for consideration of funding. The Service will then develop and award the financial assistance or contractual documents funding the final proposals that meet all federal requirements and for which funding is available. Currently the source of general funding is appropriated funds directed to the Service.   The funds shall be used for cooperative Chinook and chum salmon research and management projects in the portion of the Yukon River drainage located in the United States that are recommended by the Panel after review for scientific and technical merit. (1) Applicant Eligibility, priorities for funding, initial proposal format and required content, submittal instructions, ranking criteria, and a technical point of contact to whom questions should be addressed are available at the website identified in #2. (2) There is no "bidder's list" to get on, nor is there a solicitation package to request.  The entire solicitation package containing all submittal requirements may be accessed at this time at the following website:  http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/fieldoffice/fairbanks/pdf/RFP-RM_2008.pdf   (3)  The FWS Region 7 Federal Assistance Specialist / Contract Specialist will analyze successful projects to ascertain whether federal funding will be provided through financial assistance awards or procurement instruments in accord with 31 USC 6301-6308.  (4)  Initial proposals are due no later than 10/12/07 at 11:59 p.m. Alaska Time.  (5) There is a "twin posting" of this synopsis on http:www.grants.gov since the resultant awards will consist of procurement awards and financial assistance awards.  It is not necessary to submit initial proposals via both venues.  Point of Contact for questions concerning this narrative and methodology of evaluation is Gary Goldberg (907) 786-3408.

DTW relies exclusively upon the SRSS and associated hardware to provide MLS (Multi-Level Service) access to the desktop via the Sun Ray thin client. DIA has mandated the use of DTW for all DODIIS sites.

<DESC>This FedBizOpps posting is made to Industry as a cross-reference to earlier MSTEC Program postings to reflect the change in NAICS code and corresponding SBA size standard. The NAICS Code for the MSTEC acquisition is changed from "517910" to read "334511". As part of this change, the Small Business Administration size standard is changed from "$13.5M for NAICS 517910" to now read "750 employees for NAICS 334511" under this acquisition. The revised NAICS Code and corresponding SBA size standard will be used by the Government as the determining factor to identify small businesses, meaning those firms that have no more than 750 employees will be identified as small business firms under this acquisition. Industry is advised that the MSTEC acquisition remains a full and open competitive source selection without restriction to business size. Interested sources are advised that all MSTEC Program FedBizOpps postings will continue to be made under Solicitation "FA9302-07-R-0005" to avoid confusion so close to time of release of the RFP. Those firms who use the NAICS code as their notification alert of FedBizOpps postings are advised that the NAICS code under the MSTEC acquisition will continue to appear under "517910" due to the software program used by FedBizOpps.  Any questions may be referred to the identified Government POC.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
Project Title:  2nd Floor Courtroom Renovation
Location:  Sidney L. Christie Federal Building, 845 Fifth Avenue, Huntington, WV 25701
Solicitation Number:  GS-03P-07-CD-C-0062

Provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for renovation of existing 2nd floor courtroom.  The construction firm will be required to include existing finishes which are painted plaster walls, gypsum wall board ceiling, and carpet floors over original cork flooring on poured in place concrete.  The courtroom has significant standing and running stained ornamental trim, fixed bench seating, and guard rail.  The ceiling has ornamental dentil plaster molding and trim throughout.  Further work includes modification to juror box and associated window treatments, HVAC, and lighting.  Lastly, the work also includes providing an empty conduit system for audio and video systems.

Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.   Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, management and key personnel qualifications, technical and organizational approach, and on their price proposals.

The acquisition shall consist of four (4) phases:  Phase 1 ? Receipt and evaluation of technical offers and of initial price proposals.  Phase 2 ? Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors on the basis of GSA's opinion.  GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3 ? A determination of the competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 ? Completion of negotiations with firms in the competitive range, if necessary.  Receipt and evaluation of final proposal revisions.  

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 3, without negotiations.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel Qualifications, and 3. Technical and Organizational Approach.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220.  This unrestricted procurement is being conducted under full and open competitive provisions in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The purpose of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program is to assess the ability of small businesses to compete successfully in certain industry categories without competition being restricted by the use of small business set-asides.  This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.

The specifications, purchase order clauses and RFQ (SF 18) will be posted to FBO.  Competition is unrestricted; any responsible source may submit a quote that will be considered.  The procurement is a simplified acquisition under the FAR 13.5 Test Program, not Part 15, and any resemblance to Part 15 is coincidental.  Selection will be based on best value.  

Quotes must be submitted no later than 12:00 Noon PDST on Thursday September 20, 2007, by email to Mark.Levi@gsa.gov (email submission is required).  Quotes must include: (1) completed quote using either the SF 18 or a letter format; (2) product literatue in PDF format to include technical manuals for the proposed circuit monitor, and configuration and programming manuals for the software; (3) at least three (more than three are recommended) references with accurate contact information for customers currently using the proposed circuit monitor and software .  Price must be valid through September 25, 2007.   Email questions to Mark.Levi@gsa.gov by 12 Noon PDST Tuesday September 18, 2007, to assure time for a response. Answers to substantive questions will be posted to FBO under this solicitation number. 

There will be mandatory product demonstrations on Friday September 21, 2007.  Firms submitting quotes should contact Mark Levi at 415.522.3374 or email Mark.Levi@gsa.gov to schedule a time as soon as possible.  Each firm submitting a quote must have a circuit monitor of the type proposed set up with internet access at a location of the firm's selection.  GSA will access this circuit monitor from a conference room at the Phillip Burton FB & USCH, 450 Golden Gate Ave. 4E, San Francisco, CA, to review the features of the circuit monitor and software, usability features (e.g., speed, intuitiveness), and ability to configure and network to meet GSA's needs.  Firms submitting quotes may have a technical representative physically attend (recommended), or may arrange to have a representative available by conference call (in which case GSA can make arrangements for a webcast).  It is important that the firm's representative be able to answer technical questions about the product and software.

Selection will consider (1) price, (2) usability features of the circuit monitor and software, (3) configurability and networking capability of the circuit monitors, (4) quality of experience with the product of other clients.  If the proposed circuit monitor or software does not comply with the specifications it will be considered unsatisfactory.  If a firm does not schedule a demonstration or provide a knowledgeable technical representative by telephone or in person, the quote will be considered unsatisfactory.  Registration at www.ccr.gov is required.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the FAR and conducted under the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Test procedures for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement hereby announces the request for quote for the required items under a new RFQ N00189-07-T-0592; a subsequent solicitation document will not be issued.  Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk intends to purchase for the USS Nassau (LHA-4) for the following items: CLIN 0001 – Provide and Install Cosmetic Polymeric (Monolithic Seamless) Deck Covering – Type II, Class 2:  Existing deck covering will be removed down to bare metal surface.  Prepare and prime deck surface in accordance with NSTM Chapter 631.  Install approved underlayment to level surface and cover any raised areas across the surface area.  Install new cosmetic polymeric (monolithic seamless) deck covering material throughout entire areas specified IAW military specification Mil Spec MIL-D-24613 Type II, Class 2.  Installation of new deck covering material shall be in accordance with manufacturer’s specification and detailed requirements stated in NSTM Chapter 634.  Cove base effect shall be IAW manufacturer’s instructions or as directed by NSTM Chapter 634, which ever is greater.  Apply two coats of scaler iaw manufacturer’s specifications to complete the installation and promote durability.  Color and pattern of new deck covering material shall be specified by ships repr!  esentative.  Contractor shall maintain completion of log in order to track contract “ceiling” of specified square footage.  The area of decking measures approximately 10,000 SF as follows:  LOCATION MESS DECK (5800SF), SERVING LINE P-WAYS (1200SF), and HORSE-SHOE P-WAYS (3000SF).  Note:  This list of spaces spreadsheet shall be considered an estimate only.  Actual space identification shall be established and agreed upon at a pre-work planning conference(s) between contractor and ship’s designated representative(s).  The 10,000SF does NOT include ‘underlayment’ + Type II. This approach would only produce a total PRC coverage of 5000SF.  The total SF after installation shall include both underlayment and PRC so that final project completion shall result in 10,000SF of PRC installed. Ship requests delivery completion no-later-than (NLT) 31 JAN 2008. FOB Point Destination: Naval Base Norfolk, Norfolk, VA 23511. This solicitation is only open to all small business concerns within the Norfolk commuting area.  This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for possible Ship / Contractor pre-performance meetings and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Contractor geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   An official site visit is not scheduled.  Interested contractors may schedule a site visit dir!  ectly with CW03 Williamson williamb@lha4.navy.mil at (757) 444-1410 ext 5555 or LT McGraw mcgrwakl@lha4.navy.mil at (757) 444-8612.  At minimum, responsible sources should provide this office: a price proposal on letterhead /or a SF1449, either a price proposal on letterhead, or a SF1449 that should show the requested items; with their unit prices, extended prices, total price, prompt payment terms, remittance address, Tax I.D. #, Duns #, Cage code. Responses to this solicitation are due by 18 SEP 2007 at 1630 (4:30 P.M.) EST.   Offers can be faxed to (757-443-1402), or emailed to brandy.harris@navy.mil. Reference RFQ N0018907T0592 on your proposal. [FSC= 7220].  Numbered Notes; Number 1, the proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns. NAICS 336611 (1000). The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   Contracting Officer shall consider the following in regards to evaluation iaw FAR Part 13; Past Performance and Price, with past performance being somewhat more important than price. (1)  Past Performance Evaluation Standards: The offeror shall demonstrate Past Performance through completion of similar U.S. Navy contracts for same or similar installations.  The Contracting Officer may consider past performance experience with contracts that cover numerous other types of marine decking installation contracts.  Data submitted by the offero!  r other than relevant contracts may not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Failure to submit past performance information shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate.  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than three (3) of the firm’s most recently completed U.S. Navy (not to exceed three years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the co!  ntract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.   Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance. Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer’s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance. (a) Quality:  The offeror’s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: overall customer satisfaction, instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer. (b)Timeliness: The offeror’s compliance with delivery and/or performance schedules, timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing.  (c) Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror’s demonstrated ability to respond to customer concerns, isolates and resolves problems, and takes systemic improvement action. Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider:  the number, type, and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.   The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror’s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information, therefore the adjectival ratings generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows:  Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets and exceeds contractual requirements to the Federal Government’s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.  This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA). Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appears or were satisfactory. This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA). Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. This equates to Acceptable (A). High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective. This equates to Marginal (M). Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to Neutral (N). Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference.  In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided. The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offerors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating of past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government determines are most relevant to the RFP.  2.  Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Jan 2004), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11). The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed. The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to:  a)	Price comparison with other offerors;  b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates. Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (JAN 2004) ALTERNATE I (APR 2002), FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (OCT 2003)(a) Inspection/Acceptance Addendum:  Contractor shall expect a reaso!  nable degree of pre-acceptance inspection by ship’s representative(s) to validate and confirm all final product conforms to the specifications described in this solicitation and in conjunction with what is considered industry standard on U.S. Navy vessels here in Norfolk, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders (JAN 2004) within this clause, the following clauses apply and are incorporated by reference: 52.219-06 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003),   52.222-19 Child Labor—Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (JAN 2004)(E.O. 13126), 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (Feb 1999), 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity (APR 2002) (E.O. 11246), 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and other Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001) (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities (JUN 1998) (29 U.S.C. 793), 52.222-37 Employment Reports o!  n Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other  Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001) (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965 (JUL 2005), 52.222-42 Statement of Equivalent rates for Federal Hires (MAY 1989), 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases (OCT 2003) (E.O.S, proclamations, and statutes administered by Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of Treasury), 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration (OCT 2003) (31 U.S.C. 3322), FAR 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission Of Payment Requests (DEC 2003), FAR 52.215-5 Facsimile Proposals (OCT 1997).

<DESC>The outcomes to be satisfied are Base Operations Facility Support Contracting for the following specific services:  HVAC, Water, Sewer, Electrical, Gas, Steam, Building Maintenance including Minor Construction, Refuse Collection/Disposal and Recycling, Fire Alarm, Elevator, and Swimming Pool Maintenance and Housing maintenance of four flag quarters.  The outcomes are performance based. The Contractor’s performance will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  Past Performance, Management, Technical Approach/Methods, and Price.  The price evaluation will be approximately equal to the sum of the three technical performance criteria.  From a technical perspective, the criteria for evaluation will center on the offeror’s ability to perform contracts of this size and scope.  These services are currently being performed under the existing five year NOLA BOS contract, a small business set-aside with an annual FFP value of $2.7 Million and IDIQ task orders averaging $2 Million.  Historically, only in the last year have the IDIQ amounts exceeded $1 Million.  And though this contract is not exceptionally complex or of a significant dollar value, because it is a 100% competitive set-aside for HUB Zone Small Business, the Government is most interested in the offeror’s ability to manage multi-disciplines of non-technical specialties such as building maintenance and associated minor construction with technical specialties such as fire alarm and elevator maintenance.  Likewise utility management of water, sewer, and electrical distribution systems requires a specialty knowledge beyond traditional building/facility maintenance.

NAICs Code is 561210, Facility Support Services, and the business size standard is $30 Million. 

The contract performance period is for one year starting 01 OCT 07 through 30 SEP 08.  The contract will contain options for two (2) additional one-year performance periods, to be exercised at the Government’s discretion.  Options are not guaranteed.

The minimum guarantee will be the Firm Fixed Price (FFP) portion of the work.  Additional work may be ordered under the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Line items at the prices established at the beginning of the contract.

The maximum value of the contract, and the price upon which it will be evaluated, will be the sum of the FFP and IDIQ work for the base and both option periods.

The procurement will be competitive negotiated proposals (not sealed bid) amongst HUBZone small businesses.  This is a 100% set-aside for HUBZone Small Business but it is recognized that Refuse Collection/Disposal and Recycling may have to be subcontracted to a large business.

The government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.

The current and potential risks for this contract are no more than for a typical small BOS type contract.  The only foreseeable Schedule and Performance risks are those associated with premature closure of the New Orleans Naval Support Activity.  This would be an out year decision and the government would most likely try to coincide any shutdowns with the federal fiscal year ending periods (30 SEP) to minimize need for any partial termination of services during contract performance.  This contract will not contain any incentive award provisions, fee, or periods.

The Incumbent Contractor is Satellite Services, Inc., 309 S. Front St., Marquette, MI  49855. The Contract Number is N62467-01-D-6660. The Award Date was 01 Oct 2001. The Period of Performance Expires 30 Sep 2007.  The Total Estimated Value through five years of contract performance to include FFP and IDIQ was $20,984,434.90

The solicitation will be posted to The Navy’s ESOL Site http://esol.navfac.navy.mil under the solicitation number N69450-07-R-0077.  It will not be available for downloading until April 25, 2007.  The solicitation will not be provided in hard copy.  All interested firms must enter, register, and download the documents through ESOL.  Once the solicitation is available it will direct you to the location and time for a site visit along with points of contact for the solicitation.

The outcomes are performance based. The Contractor?s performance will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  Past Performance, Management, Technical Approach/Methods, and Price.  The price evaluation will be approximately equal to the sum of the three technical performance criteria.  From a technical perspective, the criteria for evaluation will center on the offeror?s ability to perform contracts of this size and scope.

BOX 3869, GULFPORT, MS  39505, Expiration 30 SEP 07, Monthly FFP  $50,538.41, Gov't POC: Robin Fowler (228) 871-4274 --- Custodial:  EASTERN MAINTENANCE AND SERVICES INC., PO BOX 669, COATS, NC  27521-0669, Expiration 30 SEP 07, Monthly FFP  $90,483.00, Gov't POC_Bennie Boren (228) 871-4031 --- Grounds:  BTC CONTRACT SERVICES INC., PO BOX 7286, 1879 WHITE LAKE DRIVE, WHITE LAKE, NC  28337, (910) 862-6393, Expiration 30 SEP 07, Monthly FFP  $50,194.28, Gov't POC: Cara Morano (228) 377-8577 X129

Although this contract is not exceptionally complex or of a significant dollar value, because it is a 100% competitive set-aside for HUB Zone Small Business and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), the Government is most interested in the offeror?s ability to manage multi-disciplines of non-technical specialties such as Refuse, Custodial, and Grounds.

The contract performance period is for one year starting 01 OCT 07 through 30 SEP 08.  The contract will contain options for four (4) additional one-year performance periods, to be exercised at the Government?s discretion.  Options are not guaranteed.

The minimum guarantee will be the Firm Fixed Price (FFP) portion of the work.  Additional work may be ordered under the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Line items at the prices established at the beginning of the contract.

The maximum value of the contract, and the price upon which it will be evaluated, will be the sum of the FFP and IDIQ work for the base and all option periods.

The procurement will be via competitive negotiated proposals (not sealed bid) amongst HUBZone and SDVO Small Businesses.  This is a 100% set-aside for HUBZone and SDVOSB but it is recognized that Refuse Collection/Disposal and Recycling may have to be subcontracted to a large business.

The government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.

The current and potential risks for this contract are no more than for a typical small BOS type contract.  The only foreseeable Schedule and Performance risks are those associated with seasonal destructive weather.  This contract will not contain any incentive award provisions, fee, or periods.

<DESC>The mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of Systems Safety and Mission Assurance (OSSMA), Resource Analysis Office (RAO), located at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, MD is to provide capability to Center management for independent cost and schedule estimating, risk assessment, and mission risk success utilizing existing and projected programs, their cost, technical, programmatic and acquisition implementation approach. This Office has the responsibility which includes the development and maintenance of current cost models supported by resource and technical databases, compiled from current and historical data derived and collected from NASA’s “corporate memory,” as well as from on-going market surveys and current cost projections, quotes, bids, and estimates. This capability is critical to the efficient operation of the Center, in that it involves the development of accurate resource estimation and forecasting models for the planning and acquisition of future spacecraft programs and ancillary scientific instruments, scientific payloads and suites, mission systems integration and test, and other key resource elements (i.e. cost, schedule, workforce, and risk assessment). Given the critical nature of the forecasting required, the work of the RAO includes both long-term studies and unforeseeable ad hoc investigations that require short or immediate turnaround times. The RAO has determined that at the present time, only Versatile Systems Inc,3 Duchess Dr Sicklerville, NJ 08081-5652 meets this requirement. The governing statutory provision is 10 U.S.C 2304 (c) (1), "only One Responsible Source."

<DESC>NAICS Code:  561439.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ).  The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for a commercial contract with Barristers Digital Solutions for continuation of document services currently being provided under an existing order (OFHEO-2005-66).  Barristers Digital Solutions is currently providing document services in connection with ongoing investigations, examinations, and administrative enforcement actions and proceedings.  The contract is a continuation of those document services being provided, which include the following:  conversion of documents into electronic media; production of electronic media; document endorsement; scanning; Optical Character Recognition (OCR) processing; blowing back electronic files; copying; delivering hard copy documents; and creating demonstrative trial exhibits.  This synopsis is required because the anticipated additional work is outside the scope of the existing purchase order based on its current dollar value.  Barristers Digital Solutions has unique familiarity with the nature of the needs of OFHEO with respect to document management in order to meet timelines and deadlines with no undue delay.  Barristers Digital Solutions has  unique knowledge and experience necessary, including special skill in working with OFHEO's proprietary data systems and processes, to perform the document services required by OFHEO to meet upcoming challenging schedules and deadlines at issue, including an administrative hearing beginning in October, 2007.  Due to severe time contraints, it appears that only Barristers Digital Solutions is in a position to provide the required services without significant risk under the present schedules and deadlines. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying OFHEO's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses must be submitted in writing to Ms. Janice L. Uthe, Contracting Officer, at janice.uthe@ofheo.gov.

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), Office of Water, seeks to negotiate a fixed-rate, indefinite quantity contract for analytical support services for analysis of conventional and nonconventional pollutants by classical wet chemistry techniques.  This contract will be used by the EPA to support various studies, a majority of which will involve development of industrial discharge regulations for the Engineering and Analysis Division. This contract will, therefore, involve the analysis of influent, in-process, effluent and other samples from multiple industrial categories.  Analyses will be required for samples of the following matrix types: wastewater, sludge (biosolids), sediment, soil, tissue, and pulp, as well as other solid and aqueous matrices. Because the analytical data provided under this contract will be used by the EPA to develop industrial effluent discharge regulations, which govern the disposal of pollutants from industrial sources, data must be of highest possible quality.  Analyses must comply with the specifications of the methods, as amended in the contract, and results must meet all of the method- and contract-specific quality control requirements.  Substitute methods will not be permitted.  Data will be delivered in both hard copy and electronic formats, as specified in the contract. It is essential that the Contractor employ a comprehensive laboratory quality management program, meet facilities and equipment requirements, and provide personnel that demonstrate superior levels of technical expertise in analytical chemistry and microbiological techniques. A FFP/IDIQ contract is anticipated, with a single ordering period of 5 years. This RFP will result in multiple awards, with one award being set aside for small business concerns. Other awards resulting from this solicitation will be available to both large and small businesses. The RFP will be released through the internet on the EPA's homepage at www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.Interested bidders will be required to download the RFP and related documents from this web site.No printed copies of the RFP will be available. It is anticipated that this RFP will be available about the second week in October 2007.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: On behalf of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) the Program Contract Service Center (PCSC) plans to award a sole source contract using the procedures set forth in FAR 13.5 to Doane Marketing Research, Inc. The purpose is to purchase subscription access to Doane dmrkynetec MarkeTrak AgroTrak Robust via the dmrknetec MRWeb. The Period of Performance will be from April 14, 2008 through April 13, 2009 and include two Option Periods.  Among other things, EPA is required to evaluate health, environmental, social and economic usage of pesticides. The Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) provides pesticide use-related information and economic analyses in support of pesticide regulatory activities. Information about how much and the manner in which pesticides are actually used helps EPA evaluate potential exposures, the need for various pesticides and the potential economic impacts of regulatory options. For nearly five decades, dmrkynetec has tracked pesticide usage in the world?s largest agrochemical market place. AgroTrak provides in-depth annual information on the U.S. crop protection markets. Specifically, the Doane MarkeTrak System provides current data for herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and other pesticides used on various major and minor agricultural sites. Doane Marketing Research, Inc. provides current and historical pesticide usage data on a large nationwide sample of approximately 16,000 farm level producers. Market research has indicated Doane Marketing Research, Inc. is the only vendor to provide data in this format and to extensively survey farm level respondents on pesticide usage on an annual basis. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. Interested persons may identify their interest and submit capability statements to the referenced address. No solicitation is available.  For further information please contact Kelly Lael at Lael.Kelly@EPA.Gov.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for five (5) each of "Wind River Systems General Purpose Platform (GPP) VxWorks Edition 3.5, Subscription - Floating" license upgrade.  This is an annual support and maintenance for existing real-time operating system. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase these items from Wind River Systems, Incorporated of Los Angeles, California under the authority of FAR 6.302 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Justification is based upon Wind River's unique and proprietary capabilities to provide the required support and updates.  wind River Systems designed and engineered the existing operating system, which has been in use at NASA/DFRC for more than 15 years and award to another source would cause the existing code base to be built from scratch and would be too costly and delay current and future flight programs/schedules. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30PM (PST) on September 24, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

MSHA  X-Ray Diffractometer System Requirements

The base system will include a minimum 2.2 kW generator for use with long fine line focus copper x-ray tubes with a 6 o takeoff angle.  The goniometer will be a vertical Bragg-Brentano focused beam configuration, with a radius of between 185mm and 290mm and an angular range spanning  0-120 degrees two theta at minimum.  A sample spinner will be included. A theta compensating variable divergence slit will ensure that the irradiated area of the sample remains constant and permit a 15mm minimum length of sample to be constantly irradiated.  Optics common to all proposed systems will also include divergent and diffracted beam Soller slits. An automated sample changer with a minimum capacity of 40 samples will be included. The system price will also include the cost of 100 sample holders designed for samples deposited on 25 mm diameter silver membrane filters and the cost of a closed circuit water recirculator for cooling the anode.
Software packages provided with the system will provide automated instrument control and data acquisition functions, and quantitative analysis with sophisticated user defined and controlled profile fitting and  phase identification  capabilities.

The first configuration will include a diffracted beam monochromator, an ionized gas or scintillation counter, and associated slits.
The second variation will replace the conventional point counter and graphite monochromator with a beta filter and a high speed detector capable of simultaneous data acquisition across a range of 1.5o two theta minimum at maximum intervals of .02o two theta or less. Alternatively, an energy dispersive detector optimized for copper k-alpha radiation can be quoted.
The third configuration will  include a 16kW rotating anode generator and accessory equipment quoted as an option. All systems should include the cost of an electric power conditioning system suitable for the electrical service requirements of the instrument.

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) of the United States Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, is a technical assistance provider working on the development and implementation of laws and international agreements affecting trade and investment in over 35 countries worldwide including the Middle East and North Africa.  CLDP is supporting the U.S. Government?s Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) by providing technical assistance to a group of countries in the Middle East to improve their legislative and regulatory frameworks, and ultimately, to facilitate the region?s preparedness for the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA).  As trade and commerce increases in the Middle East and the countries in this region expand their presence in the global market, it is important that their business and legal professionals have knowledge and understanding of complex commercial law.  
The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), an entity of the Department of Commerce specializing in technical assistance, will manage the program and share expertise with other USG agencies.
The present Statement of Work describes the work to be performed by a Contractor in support of CLDP?s activities under the program.

CLDP anticipates awarding purchase order contract to a commercial law advisor in order to assist the countries in the Middle East to develop laws that comply with international commercial law standards and raise the capacity of lawyers and judges in the Middle East to adjudicate those laws.   These experts will travel to countries in the Middle East to implement commercial law education programs in those countries.


2.   CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES 
In particular, the Contractor may be called upon by CLDP to do the following:
2.1	Provide presentations and facilitate discussions during legislative drafting workshops with foreign government officials and legal stakeholders related to international commercial law standards.

2.2	Provide assistance to foreign government officials with the drafting of commercial laws. 

2.3	Coordinate with CLDP legal staff and legal advisors regarding the implementation of newly drafted commercial laws, including, but not limited to assisting with the implementation of CLDP training programs for judges, lawyers, law professors, and other jurists in the US and abroad.

2.4	Draft progress reports and provide updates/information per CLDP/Washington office requests.

2.5 The Contractor must be willing travel to any of, but not limited to, the following countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.  Dates for such travel will be jointly agreed upon by CLDP and the Contractor.



3.  FORCE MAJEURE
In case of events beyond the control of the parties, CLDP and the Contractor will agree upon a new schedule and period of performance.


The duration of this contract is from date of award through July 31, 2008 with two one year option periods.     The Government contemplates award of a Requirements Contract, FAR 52.216-21, resulting from this RFQ.     Vendor must be actively registered in the Central Contractors Registration, CCR, in accordance with 52.204-7.

All responsible sources may submit a response which if timely received, must be considered by the Agency.     No paper copies of solicitations or amendments will be issued.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-55, Request for Information on Subsurface to Surface Imaging
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SN07-55
<RESPDATE>110507
<ARCHDATE>12052007
<CONTACT>Jennifer Ricklin, Program Manager, STO, Phone 703-526-4751, Fax 703-741-0093, Email Jennifer.Ricklin@darpa.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - Subsurface-to-Surface Imaging


DESCRIPTION

Visible optics (i.e., 450 to 600 nm) imaging of objects located at or above the water surface from subsurface sensors is an extremely challenging problem.  The wind- and wave-driven deformation of the water-air interface is a major limitation to subsurface imagers, with degradation from surface refraction and scattering frequently resulting in unrecognizable image content.   The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is requesting information on novel research ideas and approaches to enable improved imaging from subsurface sensor systems that mitigates the distortions caused by the water/air interface.  Information is requested concerning the understanding of transmission and scattering phenomenology, and hardware and/or software approaches to successful imaging through the water-air interface.   No funding has currently been allocated to this effort.  A Broad Agency Announcement and/or other solicitation may or may not result from the findings of this RFI.

As light encounters the undulating water surface, some of it enters the water where it continues to be scattered and absorbed.  The image also abruptly acquires aberrations caused by refraction at the interface. The resulting image as taken by a subsurface camera is blurred, distorted, broken up and attenuated.  In order to reconstruct the image, physical techniques or algorithms must be developed to counter degradations such as those caused by anisoplanatism and multiple images.   

Responses of interest may address the following or other related topics:
1.	Image modeling through the water-air interface
o	sea state (gravity waves as well as capillary waves)
o	surf zone effects
o	sensor depth
o	water/air properties 
o	apparent object elevation
o	chromatic aberration from wedge of water
o	resolution
2.	Experimental observation of wave behavior as it affects visible optics imaging
o	small-scale slope statistics with particular attention to capillary waves
3.	Image reconstruction approaches suitable for improved imaging through the water-air interface
o	hardware approaches such as adaptive optics
o	deconvolution algorithms
o	phase diversity
o	lucky images
o	image mosaicing
o	image patch techniques
4.	Polarization effects
o	multiple looks
o	obtaining surface-shape information
o	diagnosing scattering
5.	Environmental estimation
o	small-scale water/surface/air modeling and prediction
o	wave prediction
o	optics of capillary waves
6.	Innovative sensor designs
o	precise, real-time mapping of the interface shape over the entrance pupil
o	minimizing anisoplanatism
o	adaptive optics for distortion-dominated images
o	fusing information from a non-optical sensor
o	an optional list of citations including URLs if available;

The above should be submitted as MS Word, PDF, and/or MS PowerPoint documents.
Respondents are encouraged to be as succinct as possible while at the same time providing actionable insight. 

Respondents must submit one original and four paper copies of the full response and one electronic copy of the full RFI response (in Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF, and/or Microsoft PowerPoint on a single CD ROM). Disks must be clearly labeled with RFI SN07-55, offeror organization, and points of contact. The full RFI response (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to: DARPA/STO, Attn: Dr. Jennifer Ricklin, 3701 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714. Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) are due no later than 4:00pm, Local Time, Arlington, VA, on 5 November  2007. ANY INQUIRIES TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MUST BE SUBMITTED TO RFI-SN07-55@darpa.mil NO TELEPHONIC INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>PROPOSER'S DAY CONFERENCE
DARPA will host a Proposer's Day Workshop in support of the anticipated Hyperadsorptive Atmospheric Sampling Technology (HAST) BAA on September 20, 2007 at Schafer Corp, 3811 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203 from 8:30 - 16:00.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the HAST program; promote additional discussion on atmospheric sampling; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.   

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the HAST program is to develop systems  that permit exhaustive, accurate, and economical collection of atmospheric trace constituents to support chemical mapping of urban and military environments.  The system, which integrates three technical components, will demonstrate materials, packaging, and extraction technologies that sample atmospheric impurities whose concentration ranges from 10 parts per trillion to 100 parts per million by volume from 100 liter-atmospheres of gas in less than five minutes.  In the second phase, a complete system that weighs less than one kilogram including power, indexing for one hundred samples, and GPS geolocation will be demonstrated.

A website, www.schafertmd.com/HAST, has been established to facilitate the formation of teams that may choose to respond to the HAST BAA.  Networking and team formation are the responsibility of the participants and are not controlled by DARPA.

<DESC>*****The issue date of the solicitation has been extended to on or about 25 September 2007.*****  With this announcement, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issues a pre-solicitation notice for the following project: Shoreline stabilization project is located along State Route 191 (Cutler Rd) in Whiting, ME.     The project involves placement of a sto ne slope revetment along 500 feet of Holmes Bay, which will tie-in with an existing stone revetment.     The new stone revetment plan consists of clearing  and grubbing vegetation on the existing slope prior to the placement of a non-woven geotextile fabric, a     1 foot thick layer of granular fill and 2 feet of stone armor protection then be placed on top at a 1:3 slope.     On the upper slope, 8 inches of  topsoil soil be placed and the area will be seeded and planted with regional coastal plantings.     The revetment would be approximately 500 linear feet and 20 feet high (elevation 20.0 North American Vertical Datum (NAVD)).     The stone toe will be buri ed to approximate elevation 9.0 NAVD to accommodate restoration of intertidal habitat.        The toe of the revetment will be constructed in 30-foot sections.     Saltmarsh cordgrass growing within the 6,000 square foot revetment toe area, will be removed  with the root mass intact and marsh soils excavated and stockpiled.     These excavated materials will be reused during the backfill process as each section of the buried toe is completed.            The upper area of the revetment, from elevation 20.0 fe et NAVD to the top of the bank (variable elevation) will be planted with native coastal grasses and shrubs, such as speckled alder.     Coastal plantings on the upper slope will replace lost riparian fun ction and will provide an effective riparian buffer between the road and the marsh.              Construction will be undertaken from land during the dry portion of the tidal cycle and is expected to take about six months to complete.     Appropriate erosion control measures will be implemented throughout c onstruction including (but not limited to) inst allation of a hanging silt curtain to minimize migration of fine materials during excavation and construction activities.     Contractor will remove fine material collected behind erosion control structures p rior to removal of these structures.     Contractor re quired to submit a Sediment Erosion Control Plan for Corps approval prior to commencement of construction activities.     These measures will assure minimal water quality impact to sensitive fish and b enthic resources and provide a net gain of saltmarsh habit at. Construction vehicles should not be located in water throughout the duration of the project. The estimated cost of this work is between $750,000 and $1,300,000.     This solicitation is 100% Se t-Aside for HUBZone Small Business concerns.     The NAICS code for the work is 237990 with a small business size standard of $31 million. The solicitation shall be made available via the Internet on or about 25 September 2007.     To download the solicita tion, prospective contractors shall register with and download the solicitation from www.fedteds.gov. Registration instructions are available at this website. Amendment s, if any, will be available at this Internet site. Neither telephonic, mailed, nor fax ed requests for solicitation documents will be accepted. All responsible HUBZone Small Business concerns may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England Di strict.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY OF COUNTER RADIO CONTROLLED IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE ELECTRONIC WARFARE (CREW) SYSTEMS FOR COALITION AND PARTNER NATIONS BACKGROUND. In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), the Department of Defense, as part of the overall Naval Sea Systems Command PMS-408 strategy for International CREW, needs to identify Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems that are capable of saving the lives of our Coalition and Partner Nation soldiers who are exposed to Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) threats when performing their duties.  This announcement invites industry to submit system information packages that address the questions outlined below and to possibly participate in a CREW system demonstration.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to identify technically mature Vehicle Mounted CREW systems that could potentially satisfy the performance and suitability CREW system requirements of Coalition and Partner Nation military forces.  No specific acquisition requirement exists at this time.  This R!  FI is for market survey/research only. OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS. It is expected that potential systems will be an electronic unit(s) that are designed to emit a programmable radio frequency (RF) signal with the purpose of defeating/jamming a RCIED threat.  These CREW systems must be effective against a variety of known specific RCIED threats as well as potentially effective against future undefined RCIED threats.  Thus, there is an interest in products that have a high level of programmability (threat-specific software algorithms).  This market survey is intended to specifically investigate Vehicle Mounted CREW systems.  DEMONSTRATION AND TESTING. After the close of the RFI, respondents may be invited to bring a single full-up production representative system and provide on-site subject matter expert(s) for technical support for a system capabilities demonstration.  This demonstration will be at the vendor’s cost and at no cost to the Government.  More specifics regarding the demonstration will be provided with the invitation. Demonstration participants will be randomly assigned test dates.  Each participant will be provided a demonstration packet that shall include: •	Timing Protocols •	Waveforms •	Demonstration Procedures and Criteria Each participant shall be required to demonstrate all timing protocols and waveforms provided in the packet.  Each participant shall be required to demonstrate one or more additional timing protocols and/or waveforms that will be provided on the day of the demonstration. GENERAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. The proposed systems shall meet these general, unclassified system requirements.  The system: 1. Shall be capable of implementing an arbitrary timing protocol which can synchronize to GPS timing pulses. 2. Shall comply with DOD Instruction 6055.11, Protection of DoD Personnel from exposure to Radio Frequency and Military Lasers. 3. Shall comply with HERO, HERP, and HERF requirements of MIL-STD-464. 4. Shall operate at 12/24 VDC and at no more than 130/65A. 5. Shall include all antenna(s), cables/wires, power conversion/conditioning (as necessary), and mounting components necessary for operation. RESPONSES. Responses to this RFI must be in the form of an electronic information package on the proposed system.  The information package must be in Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word format.  Responses shall be given in the order of the questions listed below.  All questions shall be answered.  The response shall be formatted as follows: •	The questions and answers shall be typed single spaced in 12 point black Times New Roman font.   •	The questions shall be bolded and followed by a single blank line before giving the answer.   •	Each answer shall not be bolded and shall be followed by a double space before the next question is listed. •	The entire response package shall not exceed 45 typed pages not including spectrum plots, antenna plots, photographs, images, and drawings. Respondents may be invited to provide an operational production representative system with technical support to a Government test site for demonstration.  The response shall include a point of contact for technical and contractual issues to include name, position, telephone number, email, nationality, and US Government security clearance level.  Respondents should notify the Government POC named in this RFI by 4:00 PM on the closure date of this RFI in order to be included in the market survey.  Any responses received after the closing date of this RFI may not be considered by the Government.  Any respondents to this RFI may be contacted in the future for further information or additional demonstration.  Failure to respond to this RFI will result in no further requests for information or demonstration.

<SUBJECT>J--SHIPS SERVICE GAS TURBINE GENERATOR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<SOLNBR>N6554007G8TR
<RESPDATE>100107
<ARCHDATE>12312007
<CONTACT>Keith Mummaw, 215-897-1189
<DESC>Request for Information: This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). Intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations as how best to perform sustainment integration for Ship Service Gas Turbine Generator (SSGTGs).  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Background: The Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition emphasized to the acquisition community the importance of supporting the fleet through performance based contracts.  Under the construct of viewing the Navy as an Enterprise, the Surface Warfare Enterprise (SWE) was formed to undertake fleet focused initiatives that ensure today’s and tomorrow’s Navy will be Ready For Tasking.  The SWE quickly formed a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) team with representatives from surface Navy stakeholder commands.  The SWE PBL team identified the SSGTG’s aboard CG’s and DDG’s as a first target of opportunity to demonstrate the ability of performance based contracts to effectively support the warfighter.   Description of Need: Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD)/ Ships Systems Engineering Station (SSES) Philadelphia, as the Product Support Integrator (PSI), is soliciting information from industry regarding various DDG-51 and CG-47 Class Ship Service Gas Turbine Generator Life Cycle Support Elements (LCSEs).  The PSI is responsible for integrating all aspects of SSGTG Life Cycle Management.  The purpose of this RFI is to determine availability of Product Support Provider(s) (PSPs) to meet stated objectives, to assess current industry experience and capabilities, and to support possibility of a full and open competition to satisfy objectives identified herein. NSWCCD/SSES Philadelphia intends to use information resulting from the RFI responses to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions, and performance specifications to be included in the RFP.   Objectives: NSWCCD/SSES Philadelphia, will utilize PBL contracts to enhance the DDG-51 and CG-47 Class SSGTG systems.  The overarching objective is to reduce SSGTG Total Ownership Cost (TOC) without degrading current system readiness and reliability.  Capturing industry’s Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimates for each of the 5 functional areas (delineated in this RFI) is essential in the RFI responses. This RFI encompasses all SSGTG equipment as defined in SSGTG technical manuals (i.e. SSGTG inlet system components including the demister assemblies; blow in doors;  Foreign Object Damage (FOD) screens; and fire dampers).  SSGTG support equipment includes voltage regulators, real power sensors, no-break power supplies, etc.  All SSGTG equipment will transition to PBL support in “as is” condition.  SSGTGs include all DDG-51 Class ships Model AG9130, AG9140, and AG9140RF; as well as all CG-47 Class ships Stewart and Stevenson Model 139.   The government intends to issue a 5-year (1-year base with four 1-year options) firm fixed price performance Contract.  Estimated award date is 4th quarter FY 08.  Based on the results of a business case “best value” analysis, NSWCCD/SSES Philadelphia, as the PSI, may elect to solicit/award by Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) to single or multiple PSPs.  Prospective PSPs may respond to individual or all CLIN’s.   RFI Content: Written response to this RFI shall be limited to 25 pages, single space, 12 dot pitch. If material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  Response should include, but is not limited to the following:  A) Company History - A one page history to include: Small Business Administration (SBA) business size classification; major products; and primary customer base.  Additionally RFI responders should provide examples of past experience that would warrant the Government’s consideration of the company as a prospective PSP for Engine overhauls; Fleet SSGTG Maintenance; Supply Support; Training; and/or Backfit/Upgrades to In-service equipment.    B) Metrics - Metrics recommended and methods to create and maintain a metrics database, for monitoring the performance of each functional area of the contract.  Also discuss how metrics can be used to promote an incentive / disincentive based contract award structure.   C) Additional information - Technical or otherwise, the company deems necessary to aid the government in making an informed assessment.  The technical responses should address, at a minimum, one or all of the following areas:  C1) Engine Overhaul:  Address the depot repair of Rolls Royce 501-K17, 501-K34 and 250-KS4 turbine engines, 501-K17/K34 compressor modules, and 501-K17 turbine modules.  Deliverables include an overhauled engine or engine module, capable of providing a service life (between overhauls) of 16,500 hours for the 501-K17 / 501-K34 and 3,000 start cycles for the 250-KS4.  Other deliverables include engine teardown report; build data; test cell data; web log updates; Configuration Status Accounting (CSA) updates; storage container maintenance; as well as Packaging, Handling, Storage and Transportation (PHST) of engines and engine modules to afloat units around the world within 72 hours.   Current annual depot throughput is: 501-K34 qty 18; 501-K17 qty 8; 250KS4 qty 4; 501-K compressor modules qty 2; and 501-K17 turbine modules qty 2.  Historically 20% of inductions are the result of FOD.  Depot workload will fluctuate based on a number of factors.  RFI Responses should include how industry prefers to have a contract crafted such that it equitably takes under consideration spikes as well as low demand in any given year.     C2) Fleet SSGTG Maintenance:  Address all shipboard SSGTG and inlet system Preventative Maintenance Scheduled (PMS), Integrated Class Maintenance Plan (ICMP) standard work items, grooms, testing, calibration, corrective maintenance, and distant support.  The PSP will have access to available SSGTG special tooling (i.e. tool vans with lifting/engine removal fixtures, dollies and rigging hardware).  The PSP will conduct fleet maintenance anywhere in the world on short notice and will provide (informal) On-The-Job Training to Navy personnel during shipboard visits.  RFI responses should include proposed processes recommended for life cycle engineering support, such as, but not limited to, configuration management, obsolescence management, and maintaining current levels of reliability (i.e. 3000 hours Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)).  Also, management of shipboard maintenance philosophy changes (preventative and corrective) to properly execute the PSP role.  C3) Supply Support:  Address all SSGTG and SSGTG inlet system parts support, both consumable and repairable.  Table 3-1 provides current state parts data.  Parts Supply Material Availability (SMA) goal is 85%.  The delivery timeframes, measured by Logistics Response Time (LRT) has a goal of < 21 days.  The Navy has achieved 79% and 43 days respectively for SMA and LRT over the last 12 months.                                                    SSGTG Supply Support Parts Data 	     Parts Managed	     FY06 Demand	          FY06  Sales	SOH value 	    CG  	      DDG	     CG	    DDG	     CG	     DDG	  CG/DDG DLA	   3,260	     2,140	 968,855	  463,369	1,387,225	   707,178	    540M NAVICP	      163	         88	        262	         474	   1.2M	     2.2M	      30M 					             Table 3-1 RFI responses should offer suggestions for:  1)  PSP approaches that will bring the LRT and SMAmetrics within delivery and availability goals  2)  Approaches for managing parts obsolescence 3)  Process recommendations for inventory management and utilization of System Repairables; responsibilities such as requirements forecasting, procurement and repair execution and material transportation 4)  Plans to utilize existing supply systems stock of consumables 5)  Plans to warehouse repairables or leave in custody of the supply system 6)  Ability to transparently integrate with the supply systems requisitioning process 7)  Concept for supply chain management in a global environment.  Provide interface examples regarding inventory asset visibility in DoD systems 8)  Address packaging and transportation of repairables      C4) Training:  Address SSGTG system training traditionally provided to enlisted SSGTG maintainers at “A and C” schools; Precommissioning (PRECOM) crew training; and Prospective Commanding Officer (PCO) training.  Training will provide competency that replicates current standards.   	Historically “A and C” school annual student throughput is GSE A (160), GSM A (340), GSE C (60) and GSM C (50).      PRECOM crew (20 students, 3 week class, 3 classes per year); and PCO (8-10 Students, 1 week class, 2 classes per year).   C5) Backfit/Upgrades to In-Service Equipment:  Address installation and functional testing of SSGTG backfit/upgrade kits (including DDG modernization and CG Smart Ship).  PSP will propose and, upon PSI (NAVSSES Philadelphia) approval, fully implement process changes and new areas of improvement. The Navy has typically backfitted the fleet over a 2 year period.  Installed systems equal 252.   There are currently 299 K17/K34 Turbine engines and 109 250 KS4’s.  Throughout the 5 year PBL contract, the installed systems populations are expected to remain steady.

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA/GSFC to post an RFI via the internet, soliciting interest from potential parties interested in providing a national children’s outreach publication named NASA’s INSPIRE magazine. NASA's INSPIRE magazine will be a mass media solution designed to reach and inspire the next generation of explorers. This magazine will reach numerous middle students, their teachers and their families in order to fulfill NASA's future efforts of having the manpower to fulfill our mission to go back to the moon and onto the surface of Mars. NASA/GSFC is interested in finding a potential party to create, publish, and market a national news publication for children based on the scientific discoveries and achievements of NASA missions and technology development. The proposed publication will convey the diverse portfolio of opportunities NASA is engaged in by targeting America’s students within grade levels 5-8, at no cost to its readership.  The proposed NASA INSPIRE magazine shall meet specific publication, format, delivery and partnering requirements as specified below: 	Publication Requirements •	24 pages •	Full color •	National coverage to include Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto	 Rico •	Age appropriate articles (Middle School) •	Informative articles about past, present and future Space Science, Earth Science, Aerospace Technology, Space Flight, and new Technologies •	Articles spotlighting NASA employees to illustrate our diverse workforce and various opportunities for careers at NASA •	NASA Fun Facts, games, puzzles, spacecraft models, contests •	Teacher’s Guide to using the magazine in the classroom	 •	Monthly classroom poster (i.e. Hubble, TRACE, MODIS, Shuttle) •	“What’s NEW this month?” (i.e. Launch schedule, exhibit opening, Astronomical events) •	Internet site references to motivate the readers to explore further for more information 	Format Requirements  •	Must meet NASA Style Guide for Graphics Standards (reference: &lt;http://communications.nasa.gov/portal/site/osc/menuitem.b66436148b6772c99c60bf1036793 ea0/  ) •	Must be NPR 1450.10D compliant (reference: http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&c=1450&s=10D  ) •	Must be comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (reference:http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12  ) •	Must use a page layout program and be in Native Format 	Delivery Requirements  	Currently, the Agency is exploring two options for coverage of the printing and distribution of INSPIRE magazine:  •	The first option would entail NASA identifying and allocating federal funding for printing and distribution by the Government Printing Office; NASA would assign federal personnel to oversee those steps.  At present, however, there is no federal funding for INSPIRE magazine.   •	The second option, and default alternative, is that the publisher would also be responsible for all aspects of the printing and distribution of INSPIRE magazine. Perhaps assisted by perspective corporate sponsors. 	Partnering Requirements •	The selected publisher will create the publication for national distribution to their current subscribers’ middle schools. Along with the publication, the publisher will include Teacher’s Guides sent to classrooms.  The Teacher’s Guide will include the National Standard’s covered in the issue, discussion points, and the answers to the quizzes in the issue.  •	The publisher will provide the experienced journalism, design, and advertising staff that have previously written and marketed grade and reading level appropriate publications for students from Pre-K through 12. Articles for this effort would be created in partnership with NASA scientists and the Project Manager in order to develop stories about Science, Aerospace Research, Space Operations, and Exploration Systems. NASA will provide information, data, photos and time to interview scientists to complete the information contained in every issue published.  NASA will not be providing funding for this proposed effort, therefore the selected publisher may want to solicit corporate sponsorship in order to fund and market the magazine. Currently the Agency is exploring the availability of identifying funding or a grant for printing and distribution, but none is available at this time. This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizz Opps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents will not be notified of the results. Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments or questions by electronic submission to Justin DeWitt, Contract Specialist, Code 210.4, at the following address: Justin.C.Dewitt@nasa.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

This is a Request for Information (RFI) and not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The purpose of this RFI is to request information from interested parties supporting the acquisition of services to provide individualized information and technical assistance on job accommodations and other employment issues to individuals with disabilities, employers, and employment service providers.  This is a request for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.

Background:  The Job Accommodation Network (JAN), established originally in 1983, is a free, national service of the U.S. Department of Labor??s Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP).  JAN supplies publications, online resources, and technical assistance, at no cost, to employers, people with disabilities, employment service providers, educational institutions and others, regarding individualized job accommodations and workplace strategies for job applicants and employees with disabilities, and on a broad range of issues related to the employment of people with disabilities, including self-employment and entrepreneurship. JAN is staffed by experts, at least 80% of whom have masters level or higher degrees in the areas of law, economics, safety and environment, rehabilitation, and psychology.

Technical Contact Point: Mr. Steve Fehrman, tel (801) 777-3294; Contracting Officer: Mr. Don Leonhardt, tel (801) 777-4894.
The 526 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Systems Group is seeking sources for the engineering design and production of a phased approach to individual subsystems of the LFIC/RFIC. This sources sought synopsis is for information and budget planning only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.  Responses should be received within 30 calendar days upon the posting date of this notice.
The LFIC/RFIC is a console assembly of automated test equipment used to test MK12A & MK21 re-entry vehicle subassemblies.  It contains electronic equipment (power supplies, meters, analog and digital interfaces) that provides electrical stimulus to a Unit Under Test (UUT) to simulate the re-entry system and its operating conditions.  During test, the LFIC captures information from a UUT in the form of measurements and relays the information back to the Test Control System (TCS). The LFIC/RFIC console assembly connects to UUTs through an Interface Adapter Unit (IAU). 
The Minuteman weapon system was conceived in the late 1950s and Minuteman I was deployed in the early 1960s. Minuteman was a revolutionary concept and an extraordinary technical achievement.  From the beginning, Minuteman missiles have provided a quick-reacting, inertially guided, highly survivable component to the United States Air Force nuclear weapons system.  Minuteman's maintenance concept capitalizes on high reliability and a "remove and replace" approach to achieve a near 100 percent alert rate.  An extensive life extension program is currently underway to keep the weapon system extremely reliable well into the 21st Century.  The Air Force must maintain the capability to support the MK12A and MK21 re-entry vehicle programs to the year 2030.  Currently, there are automated test systems in place to support this need. The automated test equipment system is comprised of a TCS, an LFIC or RFIC, and several IAUs. This collection of automated test equipment has been in use and supported for approximately 30 years. As a result of the equipment age, most of the electronic subassemblies (power supplies, computer system, interface cards, etc) are no longer supported by the original vendors, thus the availability of re-furbished or used equipment has ceased in almost all cases. To counter this obsolescence problem, a multiple phased replacement program is required. The order of the program is based on the most critical and problematic subassemblies.  Due to the unique and peculiar nature of this test equipment, it is required that the contractor have a full suite of test equipment of the same or like configuration as that of Hill AFB, UT. To accomplish the following tasks the contractor must be able to engineer, build and validate hardware and software at their own facility to ensure fidelity. Installation, verification and government acceptance testing must be transitioned from the consoles used for development to the Hill AFB LFIC/RFIC suite of test equipment so as not to hinder organic production/testing. The majority of the following efforts are a mixture of modified Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) equipment however, the Measurement and Control Processor (MCP) is uniquely complex. 
Possible procurement and task schedules would be as follows (assuming contract award of Phase 3a through 4b occurs Jan 08):  
Phase	Task	Start	Finish	Months
3a	Engineer, Manufacture and Design (EMD) of LFIC & RFIC power supply sub system and LFIC Scanner	Jan 08	Jan 09	13
3b	EMD of Measurement & Control Processor (MCP)	Jan 08	Jan 09	13
4a	Production of software for P/S and Scanner. Delivery of all drawings, documentation, testing, etc.	Jan 08	May 09	17
4b	Production of MCP Replacement, to include delivery of all drawings, documentation, testing etc.	Jan 08	May 09	17
5	EMD of LFIC & RFIC Signal Conditioning Trays and Modular Power Supply Upgrade	Jan 10	Jan  11	13
6	Production of LFIC & RFIC Signal Conditioning Trays and Modular Power Supply Upgrade, to include delivery of all software code, drawings, documentation, testing, etc.	Jan 10	May  11	17
Unclassified and non-proprietary documents will be made available upon request. CD-ROMs of classified documents may be requested by authorized parties.  Contractors must maintain a secret security clearance at a minimum.  Access to classified and critical technologies is required for this effort. Foreign contractors will be authorized only for non-restricted portions of the acquisition.

<SUBJECT>R -- Defense Venture Catalyst Initiative Network Survivability and Recovery Workshop
<DESC>The Defense Venture Catalyst Initiative's (DeVenCI) Critical Information Technology Sector will conduct a workshop on Network Survivability and Recovery on November 13, 2007 at the Institute for Defense Analyses in Alexandria, VA. The workshop will provide selected innovative companies who do not normally conduct business with the Department of Defense with an opportunity to make short presentations to DoD representatives about their technologies and products. DeVenCI is looking for companies who have potential solutions in the areas of network survivability and network recovery. 

DeVenCI is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) activity that seeks to improve national security in the Global War on Terrorism. Its dual goals are to speed DoD adoption of promising new commercial technologies and to encourage broader commercial support of the DoD supply chain. DeVenCI will use workshops, technical expositions, industry outreach, and a web portal to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It will also provide timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses, but rather focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed emerging solutions to DoD user needs.

Companies interested in applying for participation in this workshop should contact DeVenCI via e-mail at devenci@osd.mil for an application. All applications must be received on or before September 28, 2007. Selected companies will be responsible for travel and all other expenses associated with their participation in this workshop.

<SUBJECT>D--NLETS Membership Renewal
<DESC>Intent to Sole Source National Law Enforcement Tracking System (NLETS) Membership Renewal The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with NLETS.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the HQ AFOSI/XIP.  This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.3, FAR 12, FAR 16.202-1 and FAR 13.302-1.  The Government has a requirement for a renewal of a 12 month NLETS subscription/membership.  NLETS is an international, computer-based message switching system that links together state, local and federal law enforcement and justice agencies for the purpose of information exchange. NLETS provide information services support for a growing number of justice related applications. To accomplish this, NLETS supports data communications links to state networks using a commercial frame relay service. All agencies within each state are serviced through this state interface. Federal and international systems operate in much the same manner. The primary NLETS	 operational site is located within the Arizona Department of Public Safety's facility, with a disaster recovery site located with the Idaho State Police for full continuity of operations in less than thirty minutes. The user population is composed of all of the states/territories, all Federal agencies with a justice component, and selected international agencies, all cooperatively exchanging data. The types of data being exchanged vary from motor vehicle and driver's data, Canadian 'Hot File' records, and INS databases to state criminal history records. Nearly 90 million messages are transacted each month. The anticipated award date is September 17, 2007.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities and submit inquiries via email by September 13, 2007 to Kyra.Hemphill@aqd.nbc.gov.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.   All information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based in this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The point of contact (POC) for this matter is Kyra Hemphill, email: Kyra.Hemphill@aqd.nbc.gov.

<SUBJECT>D -- Encase Forensic Software Brand Name Notice
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a brand name contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires Encase Forensic software for maintenance and support.  Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-6967, Attn: Stephen Colton no later than Friday, 14 September 2007; 12:00  p.m.. EST.
V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
Encase Enterprise Forensic software provides USSOCOM Headquarters the capability to monitor, investigate, remediate and protect all networks against malicious intrusion, security incidents and cyber attacks.  The software allows USSOCOM to meet the following requirements:
	More rapidly and thoroughly investigate computer incidents occurring on any and all nodes within USSOCOM?s network, regardless of its location (SIPRNet, NIPRNet and JWICS), unique closed networks and standalone systems
	Respond to IDS alerts to verify whether machines have been compromised
	Identify deviations from system baselines during INFOCON support to identify and verify integrity of critical workstations and servers
	dramatically reduce the time and costs related to investigating and resolving network wide incidents while dramatically increasing the security posture of the information and information systems contained therein
	Ensure policy compliance on all workstations and servers
	Proactively and reactively locate and eliminate classified data spillage that has strayed to a network of lower classification.
	Proactively identify and address internal and external network security, information assurance, and counterintelligence threats before they erupt into significant events.
	Locate, analyze, and capture data in a forensically sound fashion from any network-connected node.
	Identify unauthorized active programs running on the network, such as peer-to-peer communications, covert channels, and alternate data streams.
	Coordinate more effectively with criminal and counterintelligence investigators when investigating an incident.
	Comply more thoroughly and at lower cost with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the resulting NIST interpretation detailed in the Special Publication 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.  

The acquisition of the maintenance support for the current key licenses will ensure that USSOCOM continues to have the ability to provide operational forensic analysis and remediation at a level of acceptability required by DISA and DoD directives/mandates. 


The Encase Enterprise software provides a highly specialized capability surpassed by any 
other application available to resolve, isolate and cleanup contaminated areas dealing with security incidents and events of interest on or within our networks at a level and scope required to support USSOCOM?s networks.  Therefore, this acquisition will be a follow-on contract for the continued performance of a highly specialized service/software

The Encase Enterprise software allows the analyst/technician the ability to access multiple files/folders across an array of servers storing terabytes of data, in a limited amount of time to isolate data needed to be extracted and cleaned to meet NSA, DIA and DISA standards for proper handling of data spills.  No other tool on the market can provide this level of discovery and remediation.  The Encase software that is being used has also been embedded as a module interface in a DoD/Joint Staff downward directed program that will be implemented within USSOCOM this year, which will allow us the ability to further enhance our current capabilities by also protecting workstations and devices on the network.  

United States Special Operations Command believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The approximate cost of the duplication effort would be $466,086.00, as outlined in the table below.  These costs are based on expenditures under the current contract that have been incurred to gain a level of operational acceptance by the government for contractors and government employees.  

	Qty	Cost	Total
Offsite training	6hrs.	$1,995.00ea.	$11,970.00total;
  Manhours expended	160hrs.	$106.00ea.	$16,960.00total;
  Travel (TDY expenditures)	6hrs.	$1,050.00ea.	$6,300.00total;
Installation 	1hrs.	$15,000.00ea.	$15,000.00total;
  Basic edition - manhours expended	192hrs.	$106.00ea.	$20,352.00total;
  IA Suite - manhours expended	64hrs.	$106.00ea.	$6,784.00total;
Extended Onsite Group Training	120hrs.	$106.00ea.	$12,720.00total;
Initial Cost and 1 year Maintenance	2hrs.	$188,000.00ea.	$376,000.00total;
Total			$466,086.00total;

The cost that would not be recovered through open competition involves resources for testing and operational readiness (certification and accreditation, operational compatibility and continuity) with the current network architecture and the risk associated to downtime and lack of coverage during a replacement phase of new technology.

<SUBJECT>B -- Assessing Medical Preparedness for a Nuclear Event
<DESC>Congress has directed the Office of Health Affairs to sponsor an Academies project that would convene a group of experts to provide a review of the Homeland Security Department's estimates of the effects of a nuclear attack and the current level of preparation in tier one UASI cities, specifically as it relates to the healthcare capacity and effectiveness of current and developing medical countermeasures.  In order to fulfill this requirement the US Department of Homeland Security, Office of Procurement Operations intends to enter into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine on a sole source basis pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-5.  The contract will be for the convening of a committee of experts in emergency medical response and treatment, medical and public health preparedness, health sciences research, and nuclear medicine to organize a workshop and prepare a summary report on medical preparedness for a nuclear event.  The workshop will feature presentations and discussions that assess the overall emergency response activities, and available healthcare capacity (including shelter, evacuation, decontamination, and medical infrastructure interdependencies) to treat the affected population; treatments available for pertinent radiation illnesses; efficacy of medical countermeasures; the likely capability of the Federal, State and local authorities to deliver emergence response activities in a timely enough way to be effective; and the overall expected benefit of available countermeasures and those in the development pipeline.  The anticipated period of performance is from date of award through September 25, 2008.  Place of performance shall be at the vendor's facilities.  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) was established by an Act of Congress signed by President Lincoln in March 1863 to ?investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art....whenever called upon by any department of the Government.? The Institute of Medicine (IOM) was chartered in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences, under the terms of the 1863 Congressional charter.  A central purpose of the NAS and IOM is to advise the government on issues of science, medicine, and technology. The Academy and its affiliated organizations are private, independent, nonprofit institutions that jointly possess a unique status as congressionally chartered advisers to the government.  The IOM has a long tradition of providing policy advice from a national perspective. This tradition rests on the ability of the NAS/IOM to convene committees of experts who are charged to deliberate important issues of health and health care policy in an objective and independent environment that assures rigorous analysis. IOM serves an important function by bringing representatives from diverse groups together to achieve consensus on complex issues.  Interested concerns may identify their interest in the requirement and submit a capability statement to christopher.wallis@dhs.gov no later than Tuesday, September 25, 2007. Determination by the Government whether to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. The anticipated period of performance will be September 26, 2007 through September 25, 2008. Place of performance shall be at the Vendor's facilities.

<SUBJECT>--Mark Twain Lake Repair of Floating Breakwater System
<DESC>The Army Corps of Engineers, St. Louis District is considering awarding a sole source contract to Atlantic-Meeco, Inc. This is a Publicized Special Notice as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.201.  The statutory authority permit ting other than full and open competition for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Reference FAR Subpart 6-302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements.  This contract will be a Firm-Fixed Contract for the repair of a floating breakwater system (approximately 800 ft.).  The wave attenuator was extensively damaged this past winter due to extreme ice loading and high winds.  The ice loading caused the unit to partially submerge and freeze in place.  Th e partial submerging, due to the ice loading, caused a frontward listing condition of the entire attenuator.  Additionally, while in a listing position, high winds caused the lake ice mass to shift against the wave attenuator and sheared approximately one- half of the anchor cables that held the unit in place.  The cables failed, the north section of the attenuator suffered failure of several structural members causing it to partially separate.  Atlantic-Meeco was the designer, fabricator, and installer of t he floating breakwater system at the Mark Twain Lake Project, Indian Creek.  If you feel your company has the capability to fill this requirement please notify this office by 17 September 2007, 2:00 PM., CST.

DIA currently has the makes and models listed in the IGCE in operation and has evaluated these products first-hand. This equipment comprises key parts of various systems. All IT equipment must be tested for operability, inter-operability, and security reas ons. In addition, much time and effort is spent customizing several hundred software applications to properly and securely operate as part of DoDIIS/DIA systems. Once a particular make and model passes this rigorous testing and has customized software prep ared, DIA IT personnel can quickly install, manage, operate, and maintain these in an identical manner. If the same makes and models cannot be repeatedly purchased, then DoDIIS IT personnel would have to repeat this process for each and every similar syste m purchased. Any decision to change current models will impact the costs of hardware maintenance and life-cycle replacement by requiring additional funding for the necessary spare parts mandatory for the DIA's level of operational readiness.

Brand Name Justification for SmartCycler II Processing PCR System and reagent beads 

1.  Contracting Activity:  United States Department of Agricultural (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Procurement Management Branch.

2.  Nature and/or description of the Action being approved:

Approval to issue a contract for one (1) brand name SmartCycler II Processing PCR System along with the necessary reagent beads for the Avian Influenza assay.

3.  Description of the supplies and services:  

To purchase One (1) SmartCycler II Processing PCR System along with the necessary reagent beads for the Avian Influenza assay.

4.  Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition: 

FAR 6.302-1 Only Responsible Source and no Other Supplier will Satisfy Agency Requirements, (c) Application for brand description   

5.  Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited.  

The Smart Cycler processing unit is part of the Cepheid Smart Cycler II PCR system.  The required device is an add-on unit that expands the capacity to an existing system already being used in the MFDERB laboratory.  The additional unit must be able to communicate with the current software and hardware of the existing SmartCycler II instrument.  The additional unit must contain 16 independently controlled thermocyclers with the ability to obtain and record fluorescence in at least 4 channels.  The system consists of a thermocycler (processing unit) and a computer/proprietary software.  The requested unit is designed to increase capacity to an already existing system.    The processing unit consists only of hardware and does not perform any analysis or assays without the assistance of the software produced solely by the Cepheid Corporation.  This unit is the only device that will work in our existing Smart Cycler II PCR system.  

Reagent beads for the Avian Influenza (AI) assay by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol. These consist of two parts: the AI matrix beads and the AI H5 beads. These are dried-down, ready-to-use, uniformly-produced and guaranteed reagent components of the PCR for the detection of AI.   The main components of the PCR for the detection of AI are the reaction buffer, the primers and the probe. The variability in assay results occurs most commonly from the minor changes and errors in the way these components of the assay are put together. Cepheid manufactures a ready-to-use reagent for PCR of AI to be used specifically on Cepheid?s thermal-cycler, the Smart Cycler. To simplify the use of this reagent, it has been dried down and packaged in a bead form. Each bead is of the size that is good to run 4 samples. This guarantees the uniformity of assay composition from run to run on the Smart Cycler. These beads are produced only by Cepheid and designed for use on their machine. Cepheid is the sole source for the purchase of these beads that are crucial to the rapid assay of AI by PCR.     


6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.

In accordance with FAR 5.101(a) (1), a combined synopsis/solicitation to issue a contract for brand name items will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  All vendor responses to the notice received within the time limit will be considered.

7. Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable.

The contracting officer determines that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on market research and competition between dealers.

8.   Description of the market research conducted and results or a statement of the reasons market research was not conducted.

Market research was completed and no viable alternatives could be located. 

9.   Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.  

None

10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

None

11. Statement of the actions, if any the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services.

None.  At this time the Agency is unable to remove any barriers since Cepheid is the sole manufacturer of the SmartCycler II Processing PCR and there are currently no other known manufacturers for this type of system that meets FSIS requirements.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial supplies prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued.     This is a Request For Quote (RFQ) and the solicitation number is F2VUJ07229AC01R. The 6th Contracting Squadron, MacDill AFB, Florida, requires the following items: brand name only CISCO Unity VOIP.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19 effective 17 August 2007, DFAR DCN 200770802, and AFFAR AFAC 20070823. The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS), 443120 Computer and Software Stores. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 5734.. Numbered Note 29 applies: The proposed contract is set aside for Service-Disabled Veteran Owned small businesse concerns. Offers from other than Service-Disabled Veteran  Owned small business concerns will not be considered..  A firm fixed price contract will be awarded. 

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:
Line Item 1: 

	****Cisco Unity Unified Messaging for Microsoft Exchange
Complete Package  1 **** Quantity:500 (EA)**** Part Number	(UNITY-UM-USR-E);


Line Item 2:

 	****Cisco Unity Unified Messaging for Microsoft Exchange
Complete Package -  **** Quantity:500 (EA)**** Part Number	(UNITY-UM-USR-E);***

Note: This requirement is for two different systems. Please ship each line item (Part Number) seperately.



This is a brand name only acquisition which is approved based upon the following excert from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and approval. 

Unity Unified Messaging software is developed and maintained by Cisco Systems. USSOCOM requires voicemail services to provide to  its enterprise clients.  The Cisco VoIP architecture is currently installed at HQ US SOCOM and 5 Adjunct units supporting more then 2000 garrison and deployed devices in support of the Global War on Terrorism.  To purchase the required software from any source, other than Cisco, would require the use of additional resources for testing and approving compatibility with the current network architecture.  Market surveys show that it would cost over $500,000 to replace all  equipment, at all commands with VOIP systems of lessor quality. Without this brand name procurement, there would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through full and open competition.

Currently, the Special Media Preservation Laboratory performs digitization of a wide variety of original records and is in the process of implementing a digital asset management application. The software application has been purchased, is installed in the labs, and is Telescope from North Plains Systems. The current license is for NWTS use only, to enter assets and to edit metadata. We need to procure an additional Content Consumer license that will allow all NARA staff to search and retrieve digital files.
Annual software maintenance and support for TeleScope is covered under an existing contract.

2.2 General Requirements:  EQUIPMEMENT TO BE PURCHASED
Qty     Equipment and Services 1 Content Consumer License for TeleScope digital asset management software.

At least two weeks before start of contract performance, the Contractor will identify all contractor and subcontractor personnel who will require [physical and/or logical] access for performance of work under this contract. The Contractor must make their personnel available at the place and time specified by the COR in order to initiate screening and background investigations. The following forms, or their equivalent, will be used to initiate the credentialing process: o OPM Standard Form 85 or 85P o OF 306  o Fingerprint card (local procedures may require the fingerprinting to done at a police station; in this case, any charges are to be borne by the contractor) o Release to Obtain Credit Information o PIV card application (web-based) Contractor employees are required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination. Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials. Government personnel may contact the contractor personnel being screened or investigated in person, by telephone or in writing, and the Contractor agrees to make them available for such contact.  Alternatively, if an individual has already been credentialed by another agency through OPM, and that credential has not yet expired, further investigation may not be necessary. Provide the COR with documentation that supports the individual's status.  During performance of the contract, the Contractor will keep the COR apprised of changes in personnel to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes. Cards that have been lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COR and Issuing Office within 24 hours. Replacement will be at the contractor's expense. If reissuance of expired credentials is needed, it will be coordinated through the COR.  At the end of contract performance, or when a contractor employee is no longer working under this contract, the Contractor will ensure that all identification cards are returned to the COR.  Before starting work under this contract, a National Agency Check (NAC) will be conducted to verify the identity of the individual applying for clearance. Upon successful completion of the NAC process, an identification card will be issued and access granted.  Simultaneously, a NAC with Inquiries (NACI) will be initiated to determine the individual's suitability for the position. If the NACI adjudication is favorable, nothing more needs to be done. If the adjudication is unfavorable, the credentials will be revoked. In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the Government concerning the suitability of an individual to perform work under this contract, DOI shall have the right of final determination.  This requirement must be incorporated into any subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have regular and routine unsupervised access to a Federally controlled facility for more than 180 calendar days or any unsupervised access to a Federally controlled Level 3 or 4 information system.  3.2.	Hours of Work Contractor personnel are expected to conform with standard operating hours.  The normal duty hours of 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, with the exception of Federal Government holidays, with an allowance for a one-hour lunch period each day.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for a replacement hotzone for an existing International Vacuum, Inc. Horizontal Furnace, Model 121226-2100 that will be capable of 1600 degrees C operating temperatures. The Replacement hotzone must be similar in size and capability of the original hotzone depicted below. A Stainless Steel jail approximately 24" long by 13" high by 13" wide. That can fit a 10" wide by 22" long hearth plate. Jail assembly:  All of the our heat treatments will be loaded through the front of the hotzone so there is no need for access through the back of the hotzone. Holding a tight seal at the back of the zone is more important than accessibility since samples will only be loaded through the front. The back of the hotzone may be bolted on with molybdenum bolts to form a tight seal. The front door needs to be able to be easily removed for loading of the hotzone. We require the hot face sides and door shields to be lanthanum doped molybdenum, remaining heat shields can be pure molybdenum and stainless steel provided hotzone is capable of a 1600C operating temperature and uniformity of +/-10F between 1000F to 2400F (537C to 1315C). All feed throughs for thermocouples and elements, hearth, and viewing ports are to match those of the original hotzone. Element supports to be thermo-shock resistant and designed to allow for thermal expansion of the elements. Project also requires four new tungsten heating elements. 0.375" diameter to be installed in a configuration to match the current element assembly. The original hotzone is available for potential bidders to take measurements to match the original hotzone and feed throughs.  Supplier is to install the new hotzone at our facility within 16 weeks of confirmation of order. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-18. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 333994, and 500 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to NASA Glenn Research Center, Receiving Building 21 North, 21000 Brookpark Road, Cleveland OH 44135 is required within 16 week ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination.

6. Description:

The Space Superiority Systems Wing (SMC SYSW), Space Control Technologies Division (SYSW/ENT) Los Angeles AFB, is soliciting white papers to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in Space Situation Awareness in Satellite Attitude Estimation from Optical Imagery.

The purpose of this BAA is the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement.  This BAA will be used by SYSW to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  Submittals that focus on a specific system such as RAIDRS or SBSS will not be considered eligible for award.  For more information regarding BAAs see FAR Part 35.016.

The objective of this research is to demonstrate technologies enabling automatic attitude determination of satellites from imagery using limited data, such as telescope location and look angle and target satellite ephemeris, to determine where a principal axis such as the satellite line of sight intersects the earth. The algorithm or technique should be capable of operating on imagery obtained in daylight from ground-based telescopes, possibly with some degree of post-processing. Near-real-time techniques are desirable, but non-real-time techniques are also of interest, particularly if they offer additional capability (such as determination of antenna or solar array orientation). Strong preference will be given to concepts that modify existing algorithms or techniques over those offering to develop new algorithms or techniques.

Papers should address three key areas: 1) Adaptation of algorithms to the task of estimating satellite attitude; 2) Development of a toolset allowing the demonstration of the algorithms on available imagery; 3) Laboratory demonstration/validation of algorithm and toolset performance.

The white papers will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria:  (1) Suitability of the basic estimation approach to satellite attitude estimation; (2) Demonstrated maturity of the basic estimation approach (may be demonstrated for problems unrelated to satellite attitude estimation) (3) Affordability (price, in the context of affordability of white papers versus availability of funds, will be a substantial consideration in selecting white papers for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations); (4) Additional capabilities and computational requirements. Basic suitability is the most important factor. Demonstrated maturity and affordability are of equal importance. Factor 4 will be a substantial consideration but is the least important factor. Price will be evaluated and white papers may be negotiated or selected for award.  No further evaluation criteria will be used. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers submitted under this BAA.  

The white paper shall include the following items.  (a) Executive Summary:  Describe the proposed program, objectives, and approach.  A description of the innovation and benefits of the proposed approach and relationship to previous efforts should be discussed.  b) Description:  Describe the techniques, methods, materials, or ideas that will be addressed in this white paper, their innovation, and to what degree they advance the state-of-the-art.  (c) Program Plan:  Describe in detail the planned technical approach, how the approach will be executed, and anticipated period of performance in months. (d) Rough Order of Magnitude Cost Estimate (ROM).  

Please be advised that The Aerospace Corporation, MITRE, SAIC, and Scitor will be assisting the Government in the evaluation of white papers.  If you believe that a potential conflict of interest exists, or you have other concerns, contract the Contracting Officer, Ann Birbeck at (310) 535-2634, as soon as possible, but no later than the time of your white paper submission.

The cost of preparing white papers in response to this announcement is NOT considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. The work to be performed may require a TOP SECRET/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET/SCI information at time of award. 

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, phone number (310) 653-1789.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Ms Ann Birbeck (310) 535-2634.  This BAA will remain open for 6 months from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA, whichever is first.  While white papers will be accepted at any time, white papers received later in the fiscal year have a greater risk of not being funded due to unavailability of funds.  Proposers are cautioned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to bind the government.

6. Description:

The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW), Space Control Technologies Division (SYSW/ENT) Los Angeles AFB, is soliciting white papers to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in Intelligence Data Fusion and Decision Support Tools to support the Defensive Counterspace (DCS) Mission area.  

The purpose of this BAA is the acquisition of basic and applied research consistent with advancing the knowledge of data fusion and decision support tools.  This BAA will be used by SYSW to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art and increasing knowledge in the areas of data fusion and decision support analysis.  Submittals that focus on a specific existing system or program, such as SBSS or RAIDRS, or planned system will not be considered eligible for award.  For more information regarding BAAs see FAR Part 35.016.

This BAA seeks a white paper on offerors? concepts for Intelligence Data Fusion and Decision Support Capabilities focused on space control applications including Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and DCS.  It is desired that, at a minimum, Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) Fusion Levels 1-3 and potentially 0, 4 and 5 shall be addressed in the BAA concepts.  

The goal of this basic and applied research is to develop and demonstrate the capability to bring together a large number of data sources with differing formats and data types to enable predictive battlespace awareness and characterization to support a quick decision process.  Several obstacles to obtaining access to the data sources are security classification, restricted data access, or lack of a network interface.  SYSW/ENT desires to have predictive capability to identify a threatening situation which may be developing.  The goal of studying the fusing of various data sources and decision support analysis is to enable an operator to easily identify what is occurring and what the required defensive action might be.  

Offerer's white paper should recommend data fusion and/or decision support approaches for the space control mission area that provide the best method to make quick decisions and address how they will mitigate any problems to accessing the various data sources.   Offerors shall additionally demonstrate their concept to the Government by modeling and simulation demonstrations.

Below are specific areas to consider:

A. Data Fusion
1. Intelligence Data Fusion (primary focus)

b. Key entity extraction from unstructured text 
2. Sensor Fusion (secondary focus)
a. Multiple hypothesis tracking ? both quantitative (e.g. position) & qualitative (e.g. electronic identification)
b. Tools to fuse different types of sensor data
B. Decision Support 
1. Threat Level Indication
a. Ability to adapt to new threats scenarios
b. Quickly identify new trends without long training sequences
2. Data Visualization ? clearly and concisely present event data to operator
3. Data Correlation ? correlate events (objects with attributes)
C. Data Mining
1. Unsupervised ? multivariate statistics methods & clustering
2. Supervised ? classification engines including decision trees, neural networks, and Bayesian networks
D. Data Handling
1. Handle different data source formats
2. Database schema translation
3. Generate/update/manage data schema, meta data content & data dictionaries
4. Data validation methods (e.g. watermarking)
E. Information Management and Exploitation

STATEMENT OF WORK

Scope:  Install closed Circuit Television System that will replace the existing system and add new cameras that will allow for full coverage of the 433rd Squadron (customer) audiovisual flight line.  The proposed system will change some of the existing wireless transmission cameras to wired cameras using existing parts of wires already installed between buildings. The two cameras mounted on poles will remain on a wireless transmission device to transmit the video and data between the unit and the receiving building.  All cameras, wireless transmission devices, wired transmission devices and recording equipment will be replaced with flat screen LCD wall mount monitors.  Once the cameras are installed, activities on the flight line will be recorded on a 24-hour basis.  The camera video signal will be transmitted to bldg #828 where recording devices are maintained and viewed with the 24-hour Wing Command Post.  Since camera installation is located inside a ?controlled area? the customer will escort contractor personnel on-site to complete installation.  Once operational, the security camera system will be operated on a 24-hour basis by the 433rd Command Post controllers.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION 
($2,500 to $100,000)
1.  Requiring Activity:  60 CS; Mr. Kirby
2.  Contracting Agency: 60th Contracting Squadron, Travis AFB CA
3.  Purchase Request #:  F3Z3517238AC02
4.  Description of Requirement:  20 Motorola XTS?4000 Land Mobile Radios and necessary hardware and software required for them to be compatible with the Travis AFB Trunked Land Mobile Radio (TLMR) System. 
5.  Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by: FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.
6.  Justification or authority for action:
(a.)	Currently, Motorola, Inc. is the only manufacturer of radio equipment in this small form factor similar to a flip phone.  The 60th AMW?s Senior Leadership requires radios ass small as possible to reduce the overall size of the communication tools hey carry.
(b.)	Motorola, Inc. is the only known brand  that can satisfy the Government?s requirement for compatibility with the existing system on base. 60 AMW needs encrypted LMR systems, consisting of the proposed Motorola equipment list, to be programmed by Motorola so it is compatible with the existing base trunking system valued at 7 million dollars.
(c.)	Without these radios, 60 AMW Senior Leadership personnel would not be able to access the base trunking system and communicate with their work control centers, each other, and the rest of the base necessary to perform the mission.
7.  Market Research/ Other Facts:  The only other manufacturer of radios capable of operating on the TLMR system are manufactured by EF Johnson however they are larger and bulkier and not meeting the requirement to be as small as possible. These companies were contacted for a Motorola?s brand radio quote:
ACG Tech		Deborah Ross		410-224-8668
Ewing Electronics	Ryan Hawley		800-394-6496
Motorola		Joe Maduri		916-966-6611
8.  Brand Name: Motorola, Inc.
9.  Steps to improve competition:  Market research will continue to be conducted. Until such time that other vendors produce equipment meeting NSA?s policy guidance, Motorola, Inc. will remain the brand name provider.
10. Certification:  I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the FAR and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement hereby announces the request for quote for the required items under a new RFQ V0336972365826; a subsequent solicitation document will not be issued.  Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk intends to purchase for the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) the following items;
CLIN 0001 ? Provide and Install Vinyl Tile:.  REMOVE THE EXISTING DECK COVERING (DECK TILE, CARPET, ETC.) INCLUDING UNDERLAYMENT, ADHESIVE.

Note:  This list of spaces shall be considered an estimate only.  Actual space identification shall be established and agreed upon at a pre-work planning conference(s) between contractor and ship?s designated representative(s).  The 2500SF does NOT include ?underlayment? + Vinyl Tile.  This approach would only produce a total VTC coverage of 1250SF.  The total SF after installation shall include both underlayment and VTC so that final project completion shall result in 2500SF of VTC installed.
Ship requests delivery completion no-later-than (NLT) 29 SEP 2007.  FOB Point Destination Naval Base Norfolk, Norfolk, VA 23511.

This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for possible Ship / Contractor pre-performance meetings and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Contractor geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   An official site visit is not scheduled.  
At minimum, responsible sources should provide this office: a price proposal on letterhead /or a SF1449, either a price proposal on letterhead, or a SF1449 that should show the requested items; with their unit prices, extended prices, total price, prompt payment terms, remittance address, Tax I.D. #, Duns #, Cage code. Responses to this solicitation are due by 19 SEP 2007 at 1630 (4:30 P.M.) EST.   Offers can be faxed to (757-443-1402), or emailed to scott.wilkins@navy.mil.  Reference RFQ V0336972365826 on your proposal. [FSC= 7220].  Numbered Notes; Number 1, the proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns. NAICS 336611 (1000).
The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   Contracting Officer shall consider the following in regards to evaluation iaw FAR Part 13; Past Performance and Price, with past performance being somewhat more important than price. (1)  Past Performance Evaluation Standards: The offeror shall demonstrate Past Performance through completion of similar U.S. Navy contracts for same or similar installations.  The Contracting Officer may consider past performance experience with contracts that cover numerous other types of marine decking installation contracts.  Data submitted by the offeror other than relevant contracts may not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Failure to submit past performance information shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate.  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than three (3) of the firm?s most recently completed U.S. Navy (not to exceed three years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance.
Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer?s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.
(a) Quality:  The offeror?s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: overall customer satisfaction, instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.
(b)Timeliness: The offeror?s compliance with delivery and/or performance schedules, timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing. 
(c) Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror?s demonstrated ability to respond to customer concerns, isolate and resolve problems, and take systemic improvement action.
Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider:  the number, type, and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  
The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror?s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information, therefore the adjectival ratings generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 
Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets and exceeds contractual requirements to the Federal Government?s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.  This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appears or were satisfactory. This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor?s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. This equates to Acceptable (A).
High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor?s corrective actions appear or were ineffective. This equates to Marginal (M).
Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to Neutral (N).
Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference.  In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.
The assessment of the offeror?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offerors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating of past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government determines are most relevant to the RFP. 
2.  Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors? Commercial Items (Jan 2004), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed.
The offeror?s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.
Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror?s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (JAN 2004) ALTERNATE I (APR 2002), FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (OCT 2003)(a) Inspection/Acceptance Addendum:  Contractor shall expect a reasonable degree of pre-acceptance inspection by ship?s representative(s) to validate and confirm all final product conforms to the specifications described in this solicitation and in conjunction with what is considered industry standard on U.S. Navy vessels here in Norfolk, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders (JAN 2004) within this clause, the following clauses apply and are incorporated by reference: 52.219-06 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003),   52.222-19 Child Labor?Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (JAN 2004)(E.O. 13126), 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (Feb 1999), 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity (APR 2002) (E.O. 11246), 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and other Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001) (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities (JUN 1998) (29 U.S.C. 793), 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001) (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965 (JUL 2005), 52.222-42 Statement of Equivalent rates for Federal Hires (MAY 1989), 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases (OCT 2003) (E.O.S, proclamations, and statutes administered by Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of Treasury), 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration (OCT 2003) (31 U.S.C. 3322), FAR 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission Of Payment Requests (DEC 2003), FAR 52.215-5 Facsimile Proposals (OCT 1997).

<DESC>RFQ VA-101-07-RQ-0459 Combined Synopsis/Solicitation The Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) has a requirement for Diabetic Teleretinal Imaging Services. The procedures set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 15 shall be used.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice and constitutes the only solicitation/written request for quotation that will be issued. This Quality Assurance Program is to qualify the VHA validated model of teleretinal imaging that was developed in association with the Joslin Vision Network in Boston, MA and which is endorsed by both the ophthalmology and optometry advisory groups within VHA. VHA is at the forefront of developing this new method of care delivery and wishes to instate a national quality assurance process that will:  (1) Ensure one standard of care for veteran patients throughout VHA  (2) Test adherence to processes and procedures that are standardized and reporting that is done on a fixed template  (3) Provide a forerunner for a quality assurance process that will support a national privileging process  (4) Link with VHA's teleretinal training center for imagers and readers  (5) Be associated with continuing medical education materials.   This quality assurance review will safeguard against unnecessary and inappropriate medical care rendered to veteran patients.  Medical services and/or records are reviewed for medical necessity, quality of care, appropriate of place of service and standardization.Quality Assurance as generic tools is to be used to improve the processes of care for patient cohorts, and provide consistent quality of care and utilization of resources throughout the system.The reviews also are cornerstones for accountability and facilitate learning and the conduct of research.  Prior to commencement of this contract the contractor will provide a detailed document that outlines the theoretical and scientific evidence base for the methodologies employed.Additionally, a detailed project plan for the phases of the project from development of materials and include expected assistance the contractor will require from VISN VA quality managers, VISN eye care staff and the VHA leads for Optometry and Ophthalmology. Contractor support will consist of providing valid and reliable quality assurance review criteria to VA in assessing medical necessity and appropriateness of services.The contractor will also provide education and training to ensure inter-rater reliability of quality assurance reviewers as an initial effort and then ongoing as necessary.This would be accomplished by: a)	Meeting with Subject Matter Experts (SME) and stakeholders to (a) receive images and government furnished materials, (b) examine the lab-based teleretinal image examination process, image presentation and the considerations that are made from each patient's image set and the decisions that are made from this examination.   b)	Design a testing process that mimics lab-based image reading environment processes and interfaces and ensures (a) that the images are of the same quality and resolution as that use in the lab and (b) ensures valid and accurate recognition and discrimination testing and response recording across the images.   c)	Design a workable, user friendly, testing interface that will draw upon selected sets of high-resolution teleretinal images so that the user can answer analysis and diagnostic questions without extraneous or unwanted interface distractions.  This testing engine must draw upon image pools for progressively difficult case-study examinations to identify symptoms and signs of diabetic eye disorders.   d)	Draft a detailed set of wire-frames demonstrating the features, functions, navigational tools and various screens proposed.(This wire-frame model of the program will be presented to the SMEs and stakeholders for evaluation and approval.  e)	From the approved wire-frames, the contractor will create and test a prototype testing engine.This engine will consist of an interface that will allow configuration parameters such as (a) number of test items, passing range, duration of examination process, etc.   f)	From the approved prototype, the contractor will develop the test creation engine and demonstrate its functionality by producing a 20 question exam that will function from the VA Learning Management System (LMS).The contractor will create this prototype with an ability to randomly select the pre-validated images that have been supplied by the Teleretinal Imaging Training Center in Boston to present for the test battery (note that all these images must be devoid of any patient identifiers, as well be the final production version).Under each individual image in the test battery from the number of images determined by the Teleretinal Imaging Training Center scroll questions with radio buttons and other standardized responses that exactly match  the reporting and referral responses in the routine reporting template that the readers use in the course of their normal teleretinal image reading duties. g)	The Contractor produced exam will be posted and will enable accurate examination of any data collection and reporting.   h)	Codify the elements and people involved in the competency testing for readers of teleretinal imaging from creation of materials through posting of materials, readers taking tests, analyzing results and update of materials and clearly delineate how the testing engine will be managed and the role of the LMS.This initial kick-off meeting will also be used to assign future roles and responsibilities for a sustainable process for all of these processes in the future.   i)	Work with the Teleretinal Imaging training center in Boston, MA to assemble all the existing materials for testing and training that will need to reside on the user's system and ensure they are adequate for the intended use.  j)	Assemble the necessary materials on LMS as a &quot;proof of concept&quot; for review by the Teleretinal Imaging Training Center in Boston and designees they suggest. k)	Refine the materials and their presentation with these users such that they can define the definitive pre-production model of the LMS resource.In determining this initial model to determine whether there is a way in which the test materials can be presented to the readers on the high resolution monitors in the routine reading station they use. l)	Create the initial prototype with an ability to randomly select the pre-validated images that have been supplied by the Teleretinal Imaging Training Center in Boston to present for the test battery (note that all these images must be devoid of any patient identifiers, as will be the final production version).Under each individual image in the test battery  from the number of images determined by the Teleretinal Imaging Training Center scroll questions with radio buttons and other standardized responses that exactly match the reporting and referral responses in the routine reporting template that the readers use in the course of their normal teleretinal image reading duties. m)	Create a system whereby these scoring results can be trended and compared over time in pre-defined reports that are web accessible. n)	Create a system whereby a designated person at the Teleretinal Training Center can upload new images to replace/replenish the existing ones and also readily enter the validated responses such that these new materials can be readily and easily incorporated into the test battery. o)	Determine the most appropriate manner in which the test images are presented to readers on a national basis.  p)	Ensure that all requisite levels of access to the system are available and that the necessary password/other security protections are associated with this access. q)	Ensure that the data base upon which reading staff identifiers are contained are secure and sensitive data cannot be obtained by unauthorized individuals. Ensure that there is a master index of readers and that there is a suitable mechanism for this list to be maintained so that it is always current and up-to-date. r)	Ensure there is a mechanism to schedule readers for testing at the appropriate times and that a notification system is in place to bring non-completion of training or failure of testing to the attention of the appropriate person/people at the Teleretinal Training Center. s)	Ensure that the mechanism for creating validated reports to standardized images is robust. These needs to include ascertaining from the Teleretinal Training Center what are the qualifications necessary to undertake validated reads.How consensus on a validated read is obtained from the individuals on the group and the process involved if this is virtual. t)	Create an ability to run reports on each batch of test material that is used to test readers after the whole cadre of readers has been tested.The main purpose of this is to make sure there are no systematic poor responses that reflect poor test materials.  u)	 A mechanism must be created to identify the panel of experts that validates any particular image and a code given on the image.This is necessary to enable quality assurance to make sure failure of candidates on a read is not due to systematic error by a particular validation panel. v)	Work with the Teleretinal Imaging Training Center to determine whether the need for quality control of test materials should determine whether testing is done in batches and whether test results should be available immediately or deferred pending review of test materials.     w)  Design a suitable certificate for examinees to receive on passing.

<DESC>This amendment is being issued to modify a combined synopsis solicitation posted to FedBizOps September 5, 2007.  Please note that the response date of September 17, 2007 at 11:59 PM remains unchanged. QUESTION:  Does ARL currently possess a Competent Authority or an Interim Hazard Classification document allowing transport of these items per DOT requirements from point of manufacture to ARL?  ANSWER:  As long as the vendor supplies the lot number for the warheads they fabricate and N.E.W. (net explosive weight per warhead) ARL will obtain the IHC.  QUESTION:  If the answer to 1. above is no, would the successful contractor be required to apply for this transportation authority, or does ARL plan to apply for the proper shipping authority and supply the documents to the successful contractor?  Lead tim e on receiving and IHC or CA is close to 6-8 weeks in todays environment. ANSWER:  SEE ANSWER TO QUESTION ABOVE. QUESTION:  Due to release of this initial request by ARL (first posting of Thursday Sept. 6th, 2007 with a reply due Sept. 17th) and a quick turn-around requirement ARO, does the government have any latitude on the requested Oct. 31, 2007 delivery requirem ents?  With lead time on materials & explosives and shape charge fabrication/inspection lead times, it is anticipated the requested scope will require more than the expected 4-5 weeks allowed in the solicitation. ANSWER:  The vendors proposed delivery date will be considered during evaluation of the proposal. QUESTION:  For assembly of the item as found on AL56004 (Sheet 4 of 9), Locktite explosive binder is identified.  Can ARL provide the technical guidance that would allow use of either Locktite #30450 or #190017 for this application? ANSWER:  The vendor should supply a Locktite that is compatible with the materials used to manufacture the warheads as well as the explosive used.

<DESC>This amendement addresses questions received to date:

ARCHIVE SERVICES:  This is deleted from the solicitation   
BOX DELIVERY:  The OIG can accept delivery of empty boxes in bundles of 10 to 25.  Historically, the OIG typically orders 1 or 2 bundles of boxes at a time.   
BOX SIZE:  The boxes currently in use are 13.25 x 16.5 x 10.5 inches including the removable top.  The OIG does not require this exact size of box, but would accept something with a similar size.  However, the OIG will not re-box existing files, so the proposed facility should accept the current OIG box size.  Boxes should be archival quality, double bottom, removal top type boxes with handle slots.   
ENTRY FEE:  Entry fee is any cost associated with adding a new box to storage or returning a retrieved box back into storage.
LOCATION:  The facility should be no further than 30 miles away from 1425 New York Avenue, NW; Washington, DC  20005   
RELOCATION COSTS:  The OIG is preparing an estimated cost for potential relocation of existing files.  Responses should not provide a quote for this cost.  Our estimated cost will be applied to all responses to determine whether it is in the best interest of the government to relocate the existing stored files.   
RETRIEVAL FEE:  The cost of removing a box from storage so that it can be delivered to one of the OIG locations.  This would not include the delivery fee.   
SHREDDING SERVICES:  Quoted prices for shredding services should be by the box.   
STORAGE REQUIRED:  The OIG is current using approximately 3,000 cubic feet of storage.  There are no immediate plans to reduce this amount of storage.   
TERMINATION FEE:  This is the cost of removing a box from the system completely, either to be destroyed, returned to the OIG offices on a permanent basis, or at the end of the contract.
