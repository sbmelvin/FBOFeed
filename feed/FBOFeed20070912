<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services from the University of Missouri- Rolla, Dr. R. Joe Stanley,  on a sole source basis

Proposed Work
Professional services are required over a 12-month period for the analysis, design and development of techniques for (1) classifying figure images extracted from biomedical journal articles into categories suitable for Clinical Decision Support (CDS) in Evidence-Based Practice (EBP);  and (2) classifying these and other medical images by modality and anatomy in support of Multiscale Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR).  The Communications Engineering Branch (CEB) of the National Library of Medicine conducts research and development into the archiving and retrieval of biomedical multimedia information using technology such as CBIR, which allows the retrieval of images by features such as shape, color, and texture of regions of interest within the images. NLM maintains digitized spine x-ray images from second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), and uterine cervix images (cervigrams) from a multi-year longitudinal study conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for early detection of human papilloma virus (HPV) and progression to pre-cancer. The branch also supports research and development in Repository for Informed Decision Making (RiDEM) which explores methods for extraction of information for clinical journals and other NLM resources for decision support in EBP. The project is now exploring value added through use of automatically annotated images extracted from these resources to enhance the quality of the information presented. The investigator shall obtain a collection of images from the Government or sources identified by the Government. The investigator shall develop techniques for classifying the images on the criteria described above. In addition, the investigator shall develop techniques to  further classify images within each class identified above into subclasses with images of uniform appearance, e.g. lung images in coronal view, lung images in sagittal view, hand images, histopathology images, tissues images etc. All methods shall be developed in MATLAB and Java. The investigator is encouraged to use open source classification tools, such as YALE/RapidMiner (http://www.rapid-i.com) over libraries found in MATLAB, if feasible. The investigator shall explore and improve upon techniques published in the literature from evaluation forums, such as ImageCLEF. No GUI need be developed in this effort. The investigator shall, however, develop command-line routines as proof-of-concept. All development shall be done as negotiated with the Government. The investigator shall provide bi-monthly progress updates in addition to semi-annual and annual reports. The Government shall keep the investigator updated with results obtained from intramural research efforts, if available.

Required Tasks
The following tasks are to be completed. Full detail is given in the Proposed Work section of this Statement of Work. All image analysis and annotation software delivered shall be written in Java and/or MATLAB (base version R2007a) computer languages. Open source tools such as YALE classification toolbox should be used as negotiated with the Government.

Task Description
Task 1: Techniques for automatic annotation of biomedical images by modality.The investigator shall conduct R&D for automatic classification of biomedical images found in biomedical journal article figures according to criteria identified in Table 1 and Table 2, described above. Task 2: Techniques for automatic annotation of biomedical images.The investigator shall conduct R&D for classification of biomedical images on visual similarity within particular image classes annotated from Task 1. For this, the investigator shall explore and evaluate techniques found in the literature, such as those reported in Image CLEF forum. 

Notice of Government Unlimited Rights to Work First Produced Under This Contract: Government rights to work first produced under this contract are established by Federal law including, but not limited to, this specific reference: FAR 42.227-14, Rights in Data - General, (b) (1).

Requirement to Notify Government of Proprietary Work Dependencies:
Offerors are required to notify the Government in writing of any dependencies of the deliverables under this contract on proprietary, copyrighted, or patented work that potentially inhibits, restricts, or requires permission for the dissemination of the deliverables to the public, other governmental agencies or research groups, or to any other parties whatsoever.

Evaluation Criteria
1.The investigator shall have at least 8 years experience as a researcher in advanced technical applications for biomedical processing, and shall have demonstrable expertise (by conference and technical journal publications) in the areas of pattern recognition and machine learning, advanced image processing, including biomedical image segmentation; artificial neural networks, and the application of such methods to the classification of biomedical pathology in human subjects; and hands-on software skills in MATLAB and Java.
2.The investigator shall have demonstrable expertise in the application of advanced image segmentation and classification techniques to biomedical images.

The University of Missouri-Rolla is uniquely qualified for this work because of the expertise and experience of the principal investigator below (Dr. Joe Stanley) in the specific area of feature classification of digitized spine x-rays and prior published work in color normalization for medical images, combined with his extensive educational background and experience in advanced image processing. Citations of published articles in these areas are available upon request.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's decision to award   a contract to vendor CSSI Inc., for programmatic, process and training support services to the ATO Safety Service. Currently CSSI is working with the Directorate in support of Safety Management System's Implementation across the ATO and supports ATO-Safety Services (ATO-S).  The original contract was a Results Contract that expired 3/31/07.  A six-month extension was granted in order to maintain our core business of a Safety Management System (SMS) while a new contract was proposed, and the process for selection was accomplished.  This six-month extension will expire September 30, 2007.  However, due to an inability to complete the required processes to put new contract vehicles in place, a six-month bridge contract is needed to ensure continuity of services until a new contract can be let and awarded.   A full and open competition, given this circumstance, cannot be conducted in the timeframe required before the current CSSI contract expires on September 30, 2007.   The following activities and timeframes are required for a full and open competition, Market Survey (Request for Information (RFI)) (2 - 3 weeks), Screening Information Request Release (6 - 8 weeks), Receipt of Proposals, Evaluations (including security, safety and operational capability), and contract award (10 - 12 weeks).  Based on the total time required for completion of the activities, they cannot be completed before September 30, 2007, when the current contracts expire.  These activities require extensive FAA administrative and technical costs. A new and full and open competitive Screening Information Request, DTFAWA-7-R-00032 is in process and it is anticipated that publication will occur within the next 2 months with contract award 4 months later.  A market survey was posted on via the internet on April 19, 2007.

<DESC>Millar Fire Restoration, San Diego NWR, CA: Our objective is to restore the wildlife habitat function and value of the burned area.  Specific objectives supporting this larger objective include: 1.	  prevention of loss of soil through erosion; 2.	  prevention of vegetation type conversion from coastal sage scrub to non-native grassland; 3.	  replacement of floristically diverse coastal sage scrub vegetation community; 4.	  replacement of habitat function and value for endangered, threatened, and sensitive species listed above. Our specific goals with respect to erosion control are: 1.	to retain topsoil on the site; 2.	 to prevent siltation of the riparian area downhill; and 3.	 to prevent the formation of eroded gullies, or deepening of existing gullies. Our specific goals with respect to seed collection are: 1.	to gather a sufficient amount of a diverse collection of native seed, representative of the area that was burned; and 2.	 to store that seed until it is appropriate for USFWS to distribute it on the burn site. Our specific goals with respect to weed control are: 1.	to deplete the soil seed bank of exotic weed seeds; 2.	to minimize the replenishment of that seed bank by killing exotic weeds before they can disseminate seeds; and 3.	to maximize potential for growth and reproduction of planted and naturally occurring native plants by reducing competition for resources.

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for a leadership training course for non-supervisors. The class would take place on site at Kennedy Space Center on February 4-8, 2008 and May 12-16, 2008.  This course seeks to groom aspiring leaders for future supervisory and management positions. NASA/NSSC intends to purchase these services from Dr. Marc DeSimone of ILDC (International Leadership Development Consortium, Inc.), 1201 Captain's Court, Towson, Maryland, 21286.  Pursuant to FAR 13.106, the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:  1)	Dr. DeSimone has an extensive past in providing leadership training for KSC and has specifically designed a program for the Engineering Directorate to assist them with matrix organizations; 2) the leadership course is a continuation of previous supervisory training provided by ILDC to KSC -- courses which build on each other and were created specifically for the center; 3) another contractor would have to duplicate extensive effort in inverviewing KSC HR, OD and NE management, develop course materials and obtain approval by NASA management; 4) all of the preceeding would result in a significant increase in time and cost in order to gain the specialized knowledge already achieved by ILDC as well as unacceptable costs, delays, and inefficiencies ins the support of this critical training to the Engineering Directorate. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 24, 2007.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed:  See NASA Specific Note “B”.

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&D) proposals in the area of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering Science and Technology Fundamentals (SERS S&T Fundamentals).  The goal of this program is to understand the physical origin of SERS enhancement factor and to prepare functionalized nanoparticles and other substrates optimized for future chemical and biochemical nanosensor technologies.

The ability to reproducibly achieve a large SERS enhancement factor on metal surfaces represents an extremely powerful technique for the sensitive and selective detection of low-concentration analytes as commonly encountered in the detection of toxic industrial chemicals, chemical warfare agents, biochemicals, and in other sensing applications.  The detailed understanding of the physical origins of SERS associated with nanoparticles and nanostructured surfaces and associated reproducibility is the fundamental research topic of this BAA. 

DARPA is therefore interested in both theoretical and experimental approaches aimed at understanding SERS phenomena.  In particular, research directed toward the fundamental understanding of both electromagnetic enhancement (EM) and chemical enhancement (CE) mechanisms commonly cited in the literature are sought through this BAA.  Understanding of the electromagnetic mechanism where illumination intensity is enhanced due to sharp metal surfaces, plasmonic effects, or near-field coupling between metal particles in nanoantenna-like structures is of interest.  In particular, understanding the EM phenomena often described by plasmonic excitation leading to hot spots around nanometer-sized metal particles is desired.  Similarly, research directed toward understanding the nature of chemical enhancement associated with the charge transfer excitation between molecules and metal particles is also of interest.

DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. 07-61, entitled " Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering Science and Technology Fundamentals (SERS S&T Fundamentals)," is provided as an attachment to this solicitation notice and includes information on the specific areas of interest; the submission process; abstract and proposal formats; evaluation and selection/funding processes; as well as all other pertinent administrative and contractual information.     The BAA may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: http://www.grants.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/mto (go to "solicitation" area) or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.       Proposals not meeting the format or following the submission instructions described in the BAA may not be reviewed.

<DESC>EPA intends to modify an existing Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) (4D6443NTSX) with Microspace Communications Corporation, which was competitively awarded.  The BPA currently expires on 9/30/07.  It is our intent to extend the BPA by two (2) years, to expire on 9/30/09.  Microspace is required to deliver, via satellite, EPA environmental control classroom training courses, seminars, and seminars to EPA for a variety of clients and environmental programs, including, but not limited to, Tribal, Federal, State, and local governments; industry; EPA offices and other Federal Agencies; educational institutions at the elementary, high school, and college level; and other private sector institutions involved in activities related to environmental measurement, monitoring, and control.  Microspace shall perform work in the following areas:  (1) digital satellite uplink and downlink turnaround support for the delivery of a wide variety of EPA environmental control training courses to EPA's Air Pollution Distance Learning Network (APDLN) downlink sites and any additional sites for networks for specific programs (currently over 100).  The network shall be a closed network with the ability to remotely activate and deactivate any site within the network.  Support shall not require replacement, retrofit, or repositioning of any existing antenna or receiving equipment at any of the existing APDLN downlink facilities without demonstrating a cost breakdown of how this will be advantageous based on savings and/or other benefits to EPA.  Microspace shall supply and guarantee uninterrupted service using AMC-1 satellite and velocity receiving equipment.  Digital Uplink services shall be provided on an ad hoc basis as opposed to pay in advance or long-term contracting and advanced scheduling.  We expect to use from 30 to 50 ad hoc hours per year, generally in 1- to 2-hour increments.  There may be a few occasions with a 4- to 5-hour broadcast.  The broadcasts will occur on weekdays between 12:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST.  (2) Microspace must be able to provide a studio that receives a live stream from a studio with T1-line and microwave.  The studio must be able to accommodate live question and answer components and also be within a 1 hour commute from the Research Triangle Park area.  The uplink facility shall be capable of receiving a live program from any studio commercially or otherwise that EPA may use to provide a live broadcast from time to time as needed.  

Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the requirement.  If no affirmative responses are received within fifteen (15) days of this notice to determine that another qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, negotiations will be held with Microspace Communications Corporation to extend the existing BPA.  Please submit responses to:  Karen Watson, Contract Specialist, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), 4930 Old Page Road, Durham, NC  27703 or at email watson.karen@epa.gov.

IR1052-01-001 Electronic Funds Transfer Payments -
Effective May 1, 2002, in order to receive payments under this contract/award, contractors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Beginning October 1, 2002, CCR will be the primary database used to obtain contractor information for all Federal Government contracts. Contractors can complete the on-line CCR registration process by accessing http://www.ccr.gov.  Annual renewal of a contractor's registration is a requirement.  There are mandatory fields in CCR that need to be completed before the registration can become active.  For example, contractor business, name, address, telephone, point of contact, business start date, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number (plus 4 digits, if applicable), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) account numbers to permit receipt of electronic payments, are all mandatory fields.  Registration via the internet can generally be activated within 48 hours, if all the information is complete and accurate.  Registration via another method can take up to 30 days.

The CCR web site contains information and a telephone number (800-333-0505) where a contractor can call to get an expedited DUNS number, in order to start the registration process. Contractors must obtain the EFT account numbers from its own financial institution, if not already known.  Contractors will be ineligible for awards, if they are not registered in CCR, unless they meet an exception or apply for a waiver.  Contractors requesting a waiver from CCR registration must apply via the Contracting Officer.  Only the Bureau Chief Procurement Officer (BCPO) can approve a waiver from CCR registration and permit the award action, if the contractor is not registered in CCR. Any contractor meeting an exception or obtaining a waiver from CCR registration is still required to get an EFT account in order to receive electronic payments, in accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act.  Contractors shall then submit a completed Automated Clearing House (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form (formerly SF 3881) directly to:

A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.

<SOLNBR>N00019-07-R-0060
<RESPDATE>063007
<CONTACT>Melanie Bateman, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-6572, Fax 301-757-9039, Email Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the upcoming release of the Military Flight Operations Qualification Assurance (MFOQA) solicitation. This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition and provides for the procurement of MFOQA Software, an Enterprise Licensing Agreement, maintenance and support for the Enterprise Agreement, training materials, and engineering support services. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210, Software Publishers.  The basis for award of the resultant contract will be best value to the Government. Evaluation factors for award and relative importance thereof will be identified in the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP).   Contract award is anticipated in the first quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 08.

The Department of the Navy (DON) will implement a Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Program, based in part on the highly successful Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) Program.  While both programs use digital flight data, downloaded routinely post-flight, to conduct detailed trend and analysis of aircraft and aircrew performance the DON MFOQA program differs from FOQA as all data analysis and replay can be accomplished at multiple levels within the Naval Aviation Enterprise.  Potential benefits are estimated to be significant in improving Operational Readiness, Training, Maintenance Management and Safety.  MFOQA will provide a proactive means to highlight positive trends and to identify potential risks in time for corrective action.  

MFOQA will differ from FOQA in several critical areas.  A single DON MFOQA software product must be capable of supporting fixed-wing, rotary wing, and tilt-rotor aircraft in both home-based and deployed environment.  The FOQA Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software chosen for procurement to support the MFOQA program must be an Open Architecture product and readily adaptable to fulfilling the following general requirements specific to MFOQA:

Post-mission Debrief:  MFOQA will require routine, post-flight debriefing for aircrews, consisting of electronic visualization and event analysis of the specific mission.  This replay capability will be necessary on multiple, server-based workstations throughout DON shore and ship-based organizations.  COTS visualization products must support National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, as well as military-specific animation models of aircraft, cockpit, runways, etc.  

Maintenance Analysis:  A routine post-flight maintenance-focused electronic debrief and analysis is also required in the MFOQA Program.  Such capability will assist organizational-level maintenance crews in both event-driven and reliability centered maintenance tasks.  This workstation will also be enabled by a server-based system at multiple DON shore and ship-based organizations.  

Flight Data Analysis (FDA):  A multiple server and archival database system capable of handling large amounts of flight data will be required.  After data translation from the appropriate aircraft system, the analysis process will be capable of both single and aggregate flight analysis and trending, accessible at multiple organizational levels.   

Mishap Investigation:  MFOQA will also provide a valuable service in mishap investigation, by conducting replay and analysis of data that is recovered post-mishap from non-crash survivable recorders.   It is anticipated that this requirement will be fulfilled by the same COTS product that is developed to support the post-mission debrief and FDA described above.

ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation located in Lexington Park, MD was competitively awarded task order M801 under the Seaport contract (N00178-04-D-4080) to integrate the FOQA Open Architecture COTS product into the Naval Aviation Enterprise Architecture, to accomplish full MFOQA capability.  This ManTech development effort entails designing the overarching MFOQA architecture throughout the NAE, integrating the FOQA COTS software into the overall MFOQA system, and providing all training and overall long term updates and administration functions for the DON MFOQA system.

DON intends to procure COTS FOQA software, non-recurring engineering services to support the ManTech MFOQA development effort and recurring product support that will best meet the framework of MFOQA.  While it is understood that most current FOQA software products will require adaptation and support for conversion to MFOQA, DON desires to enter an enterprise agreement that allows maximum flexibility with regard to number of servers, clients, and data base configuration.  It is also highly desirable that any COTS product procured by DON be fully open to configuration changes by internal DON organizations such as addition of new aircraft types and other visualization objects, report and event set changes, as well as major modification of the web-based analysis tools to meet future needs of DON

The contract period of performance shall include a base year plus four (4) options.  The required delivery of the initial FOQA software is within six weeks of contract award.     

The anticipated release date of the RFP is the week of 30 June 2007. Upon formal release of the RFP, interested parties will be able to view/download the RFP (N00019-07-R-0060) which will be posted on the NAVAIR web-site http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.     

In addition to making the solicitation available for downloading via the Internet site, this office will also attempt to E-mail a notification of release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments to all prospective offerors that submit a request to register for this information via E-mail. E-mail requests should be sent to the following address: Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil and should include the following information for the purpose of compiling a Bidders Mailing List: 1. Company Name 2. Company Address 3. Point-of-contact, telephone number, fax number and E-mail address. In the interest of acquisition streamlining, prospective offerors are strongly encouraged to use the Internet for the purpose of submitting requests relative to this solicitation. Telephone requests for the solicitation will neither be accepted nor returned. A paper copy of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments will not be available or issued. 

NOTE:     Contractors must be registered in the Central Contract Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity.   

All Discussions, Comments, Or Questions relative to the the MFOQA Solicitation must be addressed directly to the Contracts office.

The performance, life, and cost goals for these research efforts shall be consistent with the DOD/NASA Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) Initiative and Versatile Advanced Affordable Turbine Engines (VAATE) Initiative, and the Tri-Service Reliance Science & Technology Joint Service Program Plans. This includes Aircraft Noise and Emissions Reduction Technologies. Other topics include development of Prognostics, Diagnostics, and Health Monitoring systems for propulsion, power and drive systems; development of Navy propulsion component and subsystem technologies applicable to fleet engines and near term upgrades/derivative engines which reduce fuel consumption; development of Advanced Electrical Power and Thermal Management technologies; development of Shipboard/Field Fuel Quality Detectors, Filtration Technology to Remove Copper from Fuel, and Impact Studies of JP-5 as the Single Naval Fuel at Sea.

Detailed information is provided in the NAVAIR publication “Guide to Naval Aircraft Propulsion and Power Technology Development Programs for Fiscal Year 2005”. The aforementioned guide can be accessed via the internet at:  www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/; telephone requests will not be honored.

Requests for this publication can also be made by mail to: Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, AIR 4.4T, Bldg 106, Unit ID 4, 22195 Elmer Road, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534.  This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(D) (2). 

 This announcement will be open for one year after it appears in the Fed Biz Opp’s and Commerce Business Daily. Initial Proposals and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. Initial proposals (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by panel of government experts using the following criteria: (1) understanding the problem, including the ability to plan and implement the program and formulate pertinent objectives; (2) soundness of technical approach, including ability to integrate the proposed technology, adequacy of analysis and degree of technology advancement; (3) allocation of resources, experience and management, including facilities, personnel and (4) past performance in similar efforts, specific areas to be evaluated are quality of product or services, timeliness of performance, and cost control; and (5) and the proposed cost and cost realism.  No further criteria will be used in the evaluation.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds.  Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated.   Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Since many aspects of the IHPTET/VAATE initiative are classified, the offerors and their personnel may need to possess security clearances up to and including the secret level for contracts associated with IHPTET/VAATE, contemplated under this announcement.  Specific reporting  requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award.   At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report.  Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals (IPs) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate.  BRIEFNESS IS DESIBRABLE - IPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM.  Cost estimates in IPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged.  Offerors of those IPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal.  An invitation does not assure an offeror of a subsequent contract award.  One original and three copies of each IP, and later, if invited, of each formal cost and technical proposal are to be submitted.  IPs and Proposals shall be submitted to: a)  Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, AIR 4.4T, Bldg 106, Unit ID 4, 22195 Elmer Road, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534 and b) Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, AIR 2.5.1.4.4.2, Bldg 411,  29183 Bundy Road, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534.  There will be no formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other Solicitation issued with regards to this requirement.  The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part of, or none of the responses received and intends to incrementally fund any resultant contract(s), depending on available funding. The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs for responding to this BAA. Responses should be forwarded at no cost to the Government.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Educational institutions, Small Business concerns, Small Dis-Advantaged Business concerns, Women Owned Small Business Concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business,  women-owned small business and Minority Institutions are especially encouraged to submit proposals for consideration under this BAA.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to assess the financial viability, ownership, and business operational model of a Communication Infrastructure Backbone Project in Rwanda. 

In a country with few natural resources and high population density, the Government of Rwanda (GOR) is moving quickly on its plan to make Information and Communication Technology (ICT) a major economic contributor.  The GOR is committed to pursuing new business models and an organizational structure for managing the national ICT infrastructure that will encourage an open, non-discriminatory communications regime and ensure that capacity is available to all at a fair price.  The Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA) has requested assistance from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and the World Bank to fund complementary Feasibility Studies of the Rwanda Communication Infrastructure Backbone Project with overall objective to increase accessibility of Rwanda to the global backbone communications network by providing high speed broadband connectivity. 

The World Bank Study will cover the technical assessment and proposed network design, estimated cost, and traffic demand analysis of the Project. A consulting company will be hired by the World Bank to perform the technical Study, through its funding and procurement mechanism.

The USTDA Study will be conducted in close coordination with the World Bank consultant and MININFRA.  The purpose of the USTDA-funded Study will be to address the financial viability, ownership, regulatory, and business/operational issues of the Project in Rwanda.

The Grantee for this Study is MININFRA.  In overseeing this Study, MININFRA will work with the other two public institutions responsible for ICT in Rwanda: The Rwanda Information Technology Authority and the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency.

The Terms of Reference for this Study are as follows:

Task 1: Background Research and Review of World Bank Study Technical Study
Task 2:  Market Analysis 
Task 3:  Business, Management and Financing Model 
Task 4:  Adaptation of Technical Design and Project Implementation Strategy
Task 5:  Regulatory Framework
Task 6:  Development Impact Assessment

Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

<DESC>A Request For Proposal (RFP) will be issued on an unrestricted basis with Other than Full and Open Competition. Purchase Request Number 0016110734 authorizes this procurement.  Solicitation will be FOB and Inspection/Acceptance at Origin. Contract type is a Firm-Fixed price type contract. The requested quantity is 44 each. The required delivery is 458 Days After Receipt of Order (DARO).  This item is currently sole source to HR Textron Inc., the OEM. Configuration Control applies. DSCR does not currently have an approved Technical Data Package (TDP) available for this NSN. Any firm requesting a copy of this RFP will be provided a copy. Alternate offers may be considered if submitted with a complete TDP. A formal solicitation will be issued if any vendor expresses an interest in this procurement. This is not considered a commercial item. Progress payment may not be authorized for this procurement. ABVS will be included in the solicitation and will be used as an evaluation factor. The ABVS provisions are self-deleting if only one offer is received or ABVS is otherwise not applicable to the evaluation process. Cost and Pricing Data and Small Business Subcontracting Plan are not required as the requested quantity dollar value does not exceed the threshold. The requirement is not being solicited as an LTC because the NSN is a candidate for a corporate contract that has an anticipated award date of late fall 2007.

<CONTACT>Dawn Caracci, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-965-9465, Fax 410-966-9310, Email dawn.caracci@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a solicitation to obtain the services of experienced, licensed Psychiatrists, who are Board Certified, or in the absence of Board Certification, have SSA Disability Program Experience combined with specialized training, to serve as Medical Experts (ME) to analyze and provide expert advice related to their specialized field, as needed, so that adjudicators can render accurate determinations and decisions.  

BACKGROUND:  SSA is responsible for two national disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  SSA uses a five-step sequential process for evaluating the disability claim submitted by an individual who alleges an inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA).  The program defines disability as an inability to engage in SGA by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  A medical basis for the disability claim is required, and the State disability determination services (DDS) collect and evaluate the medical information, making a determination about the severity of the medical and/or psychiatric or psychological impairment as it relates to the claimant?s ability to perform SGA.  

While many disability impairments may be properly evaluated by medical generalists, claims that involve difficult or complex issues require medical and/or psychiatric/psychological specialist and sub-specialist expertise. 

SSA anticipates the award of one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with provisions for the issuance of Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) task orders as needed.  The IDIQ period of performance will be for an 8-month base period, with four 12-month option periods.   SSA?s estimated date for release of the solicitation is on/about July 18, 2007, of which proposals will be due approximately 20 days from the date of release.   Any amendments or other information relative to the solicitation will be posted to this website (www.fedbizopps.gov).  As such, interested sources are encouraged to REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION.  Hard copies of the solicitation and any related information will NOT be provided.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All questions must be submitted via email to dawn.caracci@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), in Bethesda, Maryland and the Office of Intramural Research (OIR) plans to procure on a sole source basis with HWS Enterprises to develop and run a management skills course specifically oriented to scientists.  The objectives of the course will be to provide: assessments of management styles, through the use of those standard tests useful for scientific leadership (360 skill scope, Myers Briggs Type Inventory and Thomas ? Killman Conflict Inventory), assessment of leadership skills and self knowledge, training in the time management, training in conflict resolution, training in getting the best from teams, training in decision making, training in motivating others and identification and development of a plan for goal setting.  The contractor shall be knowledgeable of the theory and practice of education in management skills, demonstrated experience in development of a specific program appropriate for scientists, demonstrated expertise in facilitation of the program with scientists and extensive and demonstrated expertise in program evaluation and follow-up design. The course must be developed and presented by individuals experienced with the issues that scientists have and whom scientist will find credible.  NIH /OIR will be responsible for all costs associated with the logistics of the meeting, including but not limited to meeting room, audio visual, food, and local transportation, facilitating pre-session logistics with the participants, including ensuring their completion of the testing material.  The Contractor should deliver 30 copies of testing materials one month prior to the training.  Once the training has been completed, the Contractor should deliver five hard copies, along with a copy on a PC- compatible disk (in WordPerfect or  MS Word), of the final program evaluation and follow-up design.   NIH believes that the above reference firm is the only source that can provide this requirement. HWS is an expert in the development of management skills courses which are needed to continue the ongoing training needed to manage the increased complexities of modern biomedical research and the only firm to specifically design such a course for scientists.  HWS has designed courses for the PEW Scholars and is currently preparing a series for faculty at UCSF Medical School.  HWS has experience and knowledge related to the area of management skills.  NIH tenured and tenure-tract investigators to manage their laboratories, personnel and resources enable the tenure-track investigators to achieve success in becoming tenured.  HWS has successfully handled numerous courses over the past years, and have received excellent ratings from all the PIs who have taken the courses. However, if any other interested party believes that they can meet the requirements they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain detailed documentation to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation.  Respondents will not be notified of evaluation results.  The closing date will be 10 calendar days after publication.  All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor?s Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date.  If not registered or active by that date, vendor proposals will be considered non responsive.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is amending Section L of the Screening Information Request (SIR), Request for Offer to extend the proposal due date to December 4, 2007.

The Government anticipates an additional question and answer period after the amendment.     Documents currently on the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS.gov) website will be updated on that site.  Notice will be made on FAA Contract Opportunities when any SIR documents are changed.

It is the Offerors' responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement.  All amendments to the SIR after the proposal due date, must be acknowledged.

<SOLNBR>N00019-07-R-0060

<CONTACT>Melanie Bateman, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-6572, Fax 301-757-9039, Email Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the upcoming release of the Military Flight Operations Qualification Assurance (MFOQA) solicitation. This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition and provides for the procurement of MFOQA Software, an Enterprise Licensing Agreement, maintenance and support for the Enterprise Agreement, training materials, and engineering support services. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210, Software Publishers.  The basis for award of the resultant contract will be best value to the Government. Evaluation factors for award and relative importance thereof will be identified in the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP).   Contract award is anticipated in the first quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 08.

The Department of the Navy (DON) will implement a Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Program, based in part on the highly successful Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) Program.  While both programs use digital flight data, downloaded routinely post-flight, to conduct detailed trend and analysis of aircraft and aircrew performance the DON MFOQA program differs from FOQA as all data analysis and replay can be accomplished at multiple levels within the Naval Aviation Enterprise.  Potential benefits are estimated to be significant in improving Operational Readiness, Training, Maintenance Management and Safety.  MFOQA will provide a proactive means to highlight positive trends and to identify potential risks in time for corrective action.  

MFOQA will differ from FOQA in several critical areas.  A single DON MFOQA software product must be capable of supporting fixed-wing, rotary wing, and tilt-rotor aircraft in both home-based and deployed environment.  The FOQA Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software chosen for procurement to support the MFOQA program must be an Open Architecture product and readily adaptable to fulfilling the following general requirements specific to MFOQA:

Post-mission Debrief:  MFOQA will require routine, post-flight debriefing for aircrews, consisting of electronic visualization and event analysis of the specific mission.  This replay capability will be necessary on multiple, server-based workstations throughout DON shore and ship-based organizations.  COTS visualization products must support National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, as well as military-specific animation models of aircraft, cockpit, runways, etc.  

Maintenance Analysis:  A routine post-flight maintenance-focused electronic debrief and analysis is also required in the MFOQA Program.  Such capability will assist organizational-level maintenance crews in both event-driven and reliability centered maintenance tasks.  This workstation will also be enabled by a server-based system at multiple DON shore and ship-based organizations.  

Flight Data Analysis (FDA):  A multiple server and archival database system capable of handling large amounts of flight data will be required.  After data translation from the appropriate aircraft system, the analysis process will be capable of both single and aggregate flight analysis and trending, accessible at multiple organizational levels.   

Mishap Investigation:  MFOQA will also provide a valuable service in mishap investigation, by conducting replay and analysis of data that is recovered post-mishap from non-crash survivable recorders.   It is anticipated that this requirement will be fulfilled by the same COTS product that is developed to support the post-mission debrief and FDA described above.

ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation located in Lexington Park, MD was competitively awarded task order M801 under the Seaport contract (N00178-04-D-4080) to integrate the FOQA Open Architecture COTS product into the Naval Aviation Enterprise Architecture, to accomplish full MFOQA capability.

ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation located in Lexington Park, MD was competitively awarded task order M801 under the Seaport contract (N00178-04-D-4080) to integrate the FOQA Open Architecture COTS product into the Naval Aviation Enterprise Architecture, to accomplish full MFOQA capability.  This ManTech development effort entails designing the overarching MFOQA architecture throughout the NAE, integrating the FOQA COTS software into the overall MFOQA system, and providing all training and overall long term updates and administration functions for the DON MFOQA system.

DON intends to procure COTS FOQA software, non-recurring engineering services to support the ManTech MFOQA development effort and recurring product support that will best meet the framework of MFOQA.  While it is understood that most current FOQA software products will require adaptation and support for conversion to MFOQA, DON desires to enter an enterprise agreement that allows maximum flexibility with regard to number of servers, clients, and data base configuration.  It is also highly desirable that any COTS product procured by DON be fully open to configuration changes by internal DON organizations such as addition of new aircraft types and other visualization objects, report and event set changes, as well as major modification of the web-based analysis tools to meet future needs of DON

The contract period of performance shall include a base year plus four (4) options.  The required delivery of the initial FOQA software is within six weeks of contract award.     

The anticipated release date of the DRAFT RFP is the week of 6 August 2007. Interested parties will be able to view/download the documents under N00019-07-R-0060on the NAVAIR web-site at the time of release; http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.

DON intends to procure COTS FOQA software, non-recurring engineering services to support the ManTech MFOQA development effort and recurring product support that will best meet the framework of MFOQA.  While it is understood that most current FOQA software products will require adaptation and support for conversion to MFOQA, DON desires to enter an enterprise agreement that allows maximum flexibility with regard to number of servers, clients, and data base configuration.  It is also highly desirable that any COTS product procured by DON be fully open to configuration changes by internal DON organizations such as addition of new aircraft types and other visualization objects, report and event set changes, as well as major modification of the web-based analysis tools to meet future needs of DON

The contract period of performance shall include a base year plus four (4) options.  The required delivery of the initial FOQA software is within six weeks of contract award.     

It is anticipated that a DRAFT RFP for N00019-07-R-0060 will be released during the week of 6 August 2007. Upon release, interested parties will be able to view/download the documents  which will be posted on the NAVAIR web-site http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.

Technical POC/ Program Manager, Mr. David E. Krzysiak, AFRL/IFGA, 525 Brooks Rd, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-7454, email: David.Krzysiak@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. 

AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for concept developments, experiments, and demonstrations involving new and innovative approaches to support future Air Force networking, services, and information assurance requirements in the context of a Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a globally interconnected, interoperable, and secure system of systems for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel. Leveraging commercial technologies and the potential for dual use by both the military and civilian communities are two additional aspects of this program. This activity is aimed at addressing the scale and complexity of a GIG which will provide new, end-user, multimedia, information services and support, distributed   command & control, intelligence, telemedicine and similar applications. These services and applications are vital to the Air Force mission to deploy and sustain forces anywhere in the world. To this end, the ability to send a wide variety of data across a global network comprised of communications channels of varying characteristics, in a secure, survivable manner, is of prime importance. An underlying assumption is that DOD communications will be derived from the commercial, national, and international fiber optic cable infrastructure. However, to reach deployed or airborne units, wireless extension of that infrastructure is necessary. Both terrestrial and satellite transmission systems will be required to support this extension capability and will also be inherent components of these deployed networks. In both instances, they will be required to support large amounts of information throughput. Candidate areas of technical research in support of communications networking, services, and information assurance technology for a GIG are: 1) Implementation and novel Extension of High Speed Large Scale Networks:  Effective implementation of networks to support a deployed Joint Forces Air Component Command and below. Efforts should address areas related to security and authentication, survivability and dependability, traffic management and traffic flow control, network management in a virtual network environment, mobile nodes and networks, self reconfiguring, and dynamic routing. Technologies to support network
management will provide global management of the entire information infrastructure. Future management systems must provide for this overall management capability. This infrastructure includes numerous resources such as communications equipment, network switching equipment, distributed operating systems, and user applications. Encouraged are new and innovative ideas in management systems technologies including    visualization techniques, network emulation, artificial intelligence, and any other appropriate technology. Also encouraged is technology to provide specific management techniques for heterogeneous network environments, as well as cooperating management entities. Effective extension of network technology developments to provide launch points from high speed networks into highly constrained deployed networks.
2) Interoperability: For interoperability of an increasingly diverse set of transmission systems, work is encouraged but not limited to; development and demonstration of theater (deployed) fiber optic and high bandwidth RF (including satellite links) networking technology for high bandwidth communications between multi-media display systems that provide an interactive, common picture of battlespace to Theater and Component Commanders. The network should be scaleable, modular, survivable, secure, and provide for interoperability with global commercial communications infrastructure. Examples of enhancing the bandwidth capacity are: Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), ultra short pulse Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Optical Code Division Multiplexing (OCDMA) and a hybrid of such schemes. Examples of devices are: integrated transmitters and receivers, amplifiers, switches (SONET, ATM, Packet), synchronizers, frequency translators, filters, and routers. 3) User Network Services: The goal is to formulate innovative ideas for user services which use high bandwidth global networks, low bandwidth battlesite networks, airborne segments, and combinations of the these, experiment with them, and possibly develop promising ideas into demonstrable prototypes. Future services will provide the capability for day-to-day mission planning/execution in a distributed C2 coalition environment and assist commanders in making critical decisions in heavy stress situations. Past work in this area has centered around interactive, interpersonal communications services (workstation video windows, video conferencing, shared workplace graphics, multimedia presentation, multimedia conferencing, imagery dissemination) that provide the capability of collaboration among distributed users, both fixed and mobile. Also encouraged are new and innovative ideas for communications services which will support emerging technologies such as visualization and distributed virtual reality, and technologies which support new and innovative communications services such as data compression techniques or others. Also encouraged is work addressing the psychology of individuals and groups in the decision making process in distributed military C2 and the definition of new communications services which support that process. 4) Ultra-wide- bandwidth, multi-channeled, air and space-based communications networks on and between platforms:  Efforts should develop and define optical/electronic network architecture, system and subsystem (transmitter, receiver, switch, optical mux and demux, optical amplifiers, etc.) requirements for multi gigabit per second optical/electronic networks on-board air and space platforms and other AF/DOD applications.  Design and develop passive and active optical/electronic chip scale networking components (transmitters, receivers, switches) for Wave-length Division Multiplexing, RF, Code Division Multiple Access, etc. communications. Implement photonics modules for optical/electronic networking architectures utilizing Integrated Optical Circuits (IOCs) in hybrid and monolithic format.
5) Network Modeling and Simulation: Efforts should research and develop modeling and simulation tools that are trustworthy to predict, with known and characterizable accuracy, network behavior over a broad range of time scales, network sizes and technology composition.  This solicitation also seeks research on appropriate online network measurement methodologies, which in conjunction with modeling and simulation tools will provide the basis for online network analysis and control.   Deliverables should include technical reports, and when appropriate, software and/or advanced technology demonstrations. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a three (3) to five (5) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: David E. Krzysiak, 525 Brooks Rd., Rome, NY  13441-4505 and reference BAA-03-15-IFKA.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  This republishing also includes the following changes: (a) removes the following evaluation criteria "consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA"; (b) adds Ombudsman information; (c) removes Grants.gov information and (d) changes the link to the BAA Guide for Industry.  Previous modifications are incorporated into this republishing.  No other changes have been made.

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 15 July 05; FY 06 by 1 May 06; FY 07 by 1 May 07; and, FY 08 by 1 May 08. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sep 08, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Sensors Directorate, Photonics Technology Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to advance the technology in the area of photonic components and systems.  Areas of interest include devices, components, techniques, systems and applications.  

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to analog modulation of optical carriers, efficient external modulators, highly linear modulators, phase modulation techniques, optical arbitrary waveform generation, low jitter pulsed lasers for analog to digital converters, near-zero linewidth lasers, optical signal processors, integration of photonic devices and circuits, system design and modeling.   Optical modulators operating at 1550 nanometers using polymer or semiconductor material systems are of prime interest for their potential for improving performance and manufacturability.  Lithium Niobate is another material system of interest that could be used to explore new ideas in areas such as linearization for high spur free dynamic range (SFDR) analog applications.  Specific modulator performance goals include a two-tone SFDR > 130 dB in a 1-Hz bandwidth, at a 10 GHz center frequency with a bandwidth > 3 GHz.  Issues of concern include ease of fabrication and fabrication tolerances, performance stability, insensitivity to temperature (over the range of -55C to 85C), low insertion loss (< 5db fiber-to-fiber), and the potential for extending performance to higher frequencies and wider bandwidths, (nominally 2 -20 GHz).  Optical arbitrary waveform generation includes the development of a robust, practical, stable octave-spanning optical oscillator, and its ability to independently encode (both via amplitude and phase modulation) a significant portion of the individual frequency components with an update rate approaching the mode-locked repetition rate.  Also of interest is the study of optical pulse shapes that benefit laser radar (LADAR) systems in terms of improvement of signal to noise and higher target detection probabilities.  

Deliverables will include technical reports, technology demonstrations which prove out the concepts proposed, and samples of components and devices developed.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $0.50M; FY 06 - $1.25M; FY 07 - $1.25M; and FY08 - $1.5M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging between $100K to $1M per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:

1.  ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS:  Foreign allied participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.

<DESC>A shield room is to be constructed to enclose the 1 MeV output section of the pulsed x-ray source.  The room is designed to attenuate scattered x-rays and to provide a shielded, interlocked door to prevent access to the x-ray beam or scattered x-rays.  The x-rays are produced by a 1MeV electron beam incident on a high-Z target. The electron beam has a peak current of 1 A at a pulse width of 1 ?s with a repetition rate of 100 Hz.  The main shield room structure is not intended to attenuate the primary x-ray beam, it is only intended to attenuate scattered x-rays and to prevent personnel from accidentally entering the x-ray area.  An additional beam stop will block the primary x-rays.

Engineering analysis of the floor loading and seismic requirements has been done by The Delphi Groupe, Inc.  This analysis shows that the weight of ?? of lead in the walls and ceiling along with the steel supporting structure does not exceed the floor loading of the existing building.  The structure must be built to the design provided and anchored as shown to assure meeting all structural requirements.

The lead provides shield from x-rays and must use interlocking bricks or equivalent to assure that there are no ?hot spots? of x-ray flux outside of the shield room. The door must provide the equivalent shielding of the walls, have sufficient overlap to prevent x-ray ?hot-spots?  at any point while the door is closed. The door shall be electrically operated with industry standard safety features to prevent injury of any person who inadvertently is in the path of the door. Be capable of being opened manually in case of a power failure, and have interlock switches to tie into the x-ray interlock system preventing the beam to be turned on unless the door is securely closed.

The Subcontractor must show at least 10 years of experience in the installation of radiation shielding systems and be able to provide references of recent, similar projects.  It is preferred that the contractor has experience in installations at DOE facilities.

<RESPDATE>103007
<CONTACT>Anna Marinaro, (609) 485-4081
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) is soliciting proposals for resources, facilities, supplies, services, and research to complete required tasks and deliverables for the "Development of Phase 2, Rudder Study - Piloted Flight Simulator Research". This effort is required by the Office of Aviation Research, Airworthiness Assurance Branch, AJP-6360. The primary objective of Phase 2 is to develop preliminary criteria to ensure resistance to overcontrol with rudder and potential overload the vertical stabilizer for up-and-away flight. This is to be accomplished by expanding the results obtained in the Phase 1 Simulation tests described in Attachment A to this SIR.  Phase 2 shall be accomplished by using a simulator that meets the requirements defined in Phase 1 (or alternative facility if approved by the Government), conducting detailed experiments to determine criteria for transport aircraft rudder control systems (Piloting tasks for this Phase 2 are designed to guarantee aggressive use of rudder), and by analyzing results to formulate tentative criteria for rudder flight control systems in transport aircraft.  Phase 1, Test Plan, is provided in Attachment B to this SIR; this test plan is the guideline to be used to accomplish this Phase 2 requirement.   Note that both Attachments A and B were formulated under a former FAA Contract for Phase 1. The evaluation of  technical proposals will be based upon the scoring of two (2) Evaluation Factors: (1) Technical Approach; and (2) Corporate/Academic Experience, Past Performance, and Credentials.  Offerors will be required to submit separate technical and cost proposals. For evaluation purposes, technical is considered more important than cost. Award will be based on Best Value to the Government. Only technical proposals with a technical rating of Excellent or Good will be considered for award. Combined technical criteria are more important than cost, therefore the successful offeror may not be the lowest priced offeror. However, costs proposed may become more important as the difference between competing technical scores decreases. Interested parties responding to this Solicitation are directed to the attached SIR (SF-33 Cover Sheet - page 1, pages 2 through 91 of the SIR, and 5 Attachments, Attachments A through E). All questions /inquires must be provided in writing to the Contracting Officer, Anna M. Marinaro, at anna.marinaro@faa.gov, not later than October 9, 2007, by 10:00 A.M., local time. Proposals are due to her not later than October 30, 2007, at 2:00 P.M., local time.  This SIR does not commit or obligate the Government.  **Offerors are cautioned to review all SIR and Attachments provided with this posting.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration requests information for a potential program intended to increase the efficiency of screening checkpoints at the nation?s airports.  The intent of this program is to reduce peak wait times at checkpoints and to provide better customer service, illustrating TSA?s belief that improved customer service and improved security go hand-in-hand.

One potential approach for reducing peak wait times is through a Checkpoint Reservation System.  Through this RFI TSA is seeking information to assist in the development of a Business Model for a Checkpoint Reservations System or other ideas that could reduce peak wait times. 

TSA desires innovative and creative ideas for reducing peak wait times.  Specifically, TSA seeks alternative approaches to implement a Checkpoint Reservations System and wishes to identify any parties interested in such implementation.  After reviewing the responses, TSA may incorporate any or all of the information provided into the final approach for reducing peak wait times.  


NOTE:  Attachment I to this RFI provides additional critical background information.


Business Models:  The TSA seeks discussion around potential business models for this program.  Decisions on the business model will be made based on the relative risk to the TSA and the contractor, as well as cost to the passenger.

Business models that have been discussed include the following:
1.	TSA hosted model:  A third party service provider under contract to TSA would provide the service to all passengers at participating airports at no cost to the passenger.  (Risk to TSA)
2.	Transactional cost model (Single provider):  A third party service provider is competitively selected by TSA.  The provider sells reservations to passengers at a nominal rate. The provider is the sole provider for the service for the length of the agreement with TSA. (Risk to contractor)
3.	Transactional cost model (multiple providers):  Any approved third party service provider may sell reservations to passengers.  Cost for the reservation is determined by free-market forces on a transactional basis. (Risk to contractor, Risk to passenger for cost).
4.	Subscription cost model:    Same as 2 and 3 above, but passengers could purchase reservations on an subscription basis (i.e. annual subscription for all participating airports)
5.	Advertising Model:   No cost to TSA or the passenger. On the reservation media, the service provider would include advertisements.  TSA would have oversight on the advertisements to ensure the advertisements were not objectionable.

Submission Instructions:  Submissions may address how the critical functions would be performed within any of the identified business models or within other business models.  TSA is interested in understanding which business model(s) would be most viable and what is necessary to make the business model(s) successful.  Submissions may also address the following:

?	What level of capital/infrastructure investment required 
?	Operational costs and resultant pricing of your services to applicants and/or partners 
?	Identification of the roles of service providers and possible contractual relationships with airlines and airports   

Submissions may also address other means to reduce peak wait times that are not directly tied to the Checkpoint Reservations System.

Please note that this request for information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for competitive bids or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Since this is not an active procurement, please do not include your business qualification statements. Submissions should be limited to a total count of 15 standard pages per submittal.  Send all responses via e-mail to the TSA Point of Contact provided herein by 12:00 noon Eastern, 19 September 2007.  Early submittals are encouraged and will be reviewed upon receipt. Telephonic responses will not be accepted, nor will questions be entertained at this point.  Pending interest, TSA will plan an industry day to answer questions about the program.  Please indicate your interest in participating in an industry day.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request For Information (RFI) Synopsis.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The following information is provided to assist Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) in conducting market research of industry to identify potential contractors who have maintenance trainer experience and who may possess innovative technology that is of potential use on the VH-71 program in training aircraft maintenance and enlisted aircrew personnel.     

The VH-71 mission is to provide safe and timely helicopter transportation for the President and Vice President of the United States, Heads of State and other official parties.   The VH-71 program is currently in the Increment I Pre-Production Phase to provide an Initial Operational Capability.  Increment II will provide Full Operational Capability (FOC) for the VH-71 aircraft.  The Government intends to procure a Composite Maintenance Trainer (CMT), to include a full suite of avionics, using Increment II funding and make available for training in May 2012.

The VH-71 CMT will be located at the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), Marine Corp Base Quantico, Virginia. The CMT will represent the physical and functional performance of the Increment II Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) design baseline aircraft.

The CMT will primarily be used to conduct initial and advanced system maintenance training for transition to the VH-71 aircraft, and support proficiency training to maintain currency. The CMT will also enhance the training associated with executive transport operations, cockpit maintenance familiarization procedures, daily readiness checks, and enlisted aircrew pre-flight training. 

It is expected that the CMT will replicate form, fit and function of design basis aircraft and provide the best technical approach (Performance and Life Cycle costs considered) related to the use of emulation, simulation, and/or stimulation of the aircraft systems.  The device will take advantage of new technology where Front End Analysis proves this to be beneficial.

To ensure the CMT is developed to provide effective training on all systems, the overall device fidelity shall be equal to the aircraft and capable of increasing the skill levels of the student.  The CMT is intended to provide HMX-1 personnel specialized training to maintain a high state of proficiency in:
(1) maintaining the VH-71 and all associated subsystems,
(2) executing scheduled maintenance and normal operational procedures, 
(3) recognizing malfunctions and abnormal indications, 
(4) executing corresponding emergency procedures, and 
(5) troubleshooting malfunctions and performing repair and functional checks using aircraft technical manuals.

Contractors who have technology that they believe will assist us in accomplishing the above effort are invited to submit literature, brochures and capability summaries describing relevant technologies that could be used to meet the CMT training requirements. Capability summaries should not exceed 12 pages.  Information should be sent via e-mail to Mark.Lysaght@navy.mil.   Responses are requested by 3:00pm October 31, 2007. The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services or supplies, or for the Government to pay for the information received. No solicitation document exists at this time.

Street, Detroit, MI 48201 intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Compumedics USA, 7850 Paseo Del Norte, El Paso, TX 79912.  The proposed contract action is for the purchase of a Siesta 802-PSG multifunction Wireless and Ambulatory Recording System.

The wireless nature of the system is crucial as it allows &quot;portability&quot; in that the system can be easily relocated to a different area of the hospital in a short notice.  The system must have the capability for HL7/Vista interface.  This interface is imperative for the system to be compatible with CPRS System.  The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  All FAR provisions and clauses may be reviewed and/or obtained from the General Service internet address: http://www.arnet.gov/far.

<DESC>This is a market research, sources sought announcement only-solicitations are not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This notice does not constitute a commitment from the Government. The Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) located at 5000 South 13th Street, Leavenworth, KS 66048 requires a modification to the Flex Pick 1 Labeling Conveyor.  The exisiting Flex Pick 1 Labeling area has the incoming totes filled with unlabeled product entering the labeling area at a height that requires employees to reach down, pull and lift the tote, and place it on the desktop.  The employee then labels all necessary product, places it back in the tote, then lifts the tote and places it on the upper outgoing conveyor.  The new layout must be in the same area but the conveyor may be extended to allow for height changes. Any relocation of the FlexPick 1 labeling PC's, printers, workstations, lighting, power, power poles, fiber optic network  including all parts, materials and labor required to convert the existing conveyor to the new ergonomic layout will be manufactured, supplied and installed by the contractor. All work performed will comply with the National Electric Code and local building codes.  A Government proposal to provide this service is being considered, and a contract may or may not result.  Market research is being conducted to determine interest and capability of potential sources for this requirement.  All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. The response date for the market survey is September 19, 2007. All responses are to be submitted via email to Linda.Bayer@va.gov or Loyd.Jackson@va.gov.

<SUBJECT>25--Improved HMMWV Lifting Jack
<SOLNBR>W56HZVHMMWVJACK
<RESPDATE>101507
<ARCHDATE>12142007
<CONTACT>Dave Greer, 586 574-8898
<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) along with PM Light Tactical Vehicle (PM-LTV) Warren Michigan is conducting a Sources Sought Market Survey.  The purpose of this market survey is to determine industry capability in providin g Lifting Jack technologies that meet the following requirements.  This market survey is for planning purposes only and is in no way binding on the Government and does not represent an established requirement.  The Government is not requesting any interest ed or potential suppliers to incur any expenses of any kind in connection with their review of the market survey questionnaire or their response to the survey.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this survey or otherwise pay  for information requested. Background:  The current 3.5-ton scissor jack issued with the HMMWV at production is not capable of lifting fully loaded HMMWVs equipped with the improved armor package creating a significant safety issue for Soldiers.  Due to the addition of increased arm or protection and increasing field payloads the vehicles sit much lower on their suspension making placement of the current jack difficult.  As a result vehicle weights increased to approximately 15,400 lbs.  The increased weight and ultimately reduced gro und clearance reduces access to the approved vehicle lifting points. The improved HMMWV Lifting Jack technical capabilities include the following.  We ask that you comment on your capability of each of these requirements Shall lift any corner of a 15400 lbs (8800 lbs rear to 6600 lbs front axle weight) vehicle with tire completely removed to allow for wheel replacement.  Objective is 17000 lbs. Shall meet lift requirement when using any improved or unimproved surface including but not limited to pavement mud sand wet sand snow gravel and dirt. Shall meet lift requirement when placed on longitudinal and or lateral grade of 7 percent. Shall keep vehicle safe and stable throughout lifting process and at tire-change height. Shall withstand a proof load of 12800 lbs at full extension for 10-minutes.  Objective is 14100 lbs. Shall require input effort no greater than 54 Joules. Shall meet lift requirement at a minimum of 100 consecutive full-stroke lifts. Time to assemble jack system and lift vehicle to allow for wheel replacement shall be no greater than 5 minutes.  Objective is 2.5 minutes. Time to lower vehicle and disassemble jack system shall be no greater than 1 minute.  Objective is 0.5 minutes. Jack system assembly and task shall be performed by no more than one soldier. Jack system weight shall not exceed 80 lbs.  Objective is 16 lbs. Jack system size shall not exceed 3.0 cubic feet.  Objective is 0.6 cubic feet. Jack system maintenance shall require lube grease points only.  Objective is a completely maintenance-free system with no wear parts. To assist you in the ground clearance of the HMMWV, the following estimates are provided as an example  When one corner of a HMMWV is resting on the runflat testing has shown that ground clearance to the lower control arm can be as low as 5 inches or less,  depending on vehicle loading, terrain, and other factors.  Similarly, ground clearances to the rear crossmember and rear bumper are approximately 14 inches and 20 inches respectively.  You might choose to visit a National Guard or Depot to become familiar  with ground clearances for the HMMWV when determining your products capability in meeting our requirements.   MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE  HMMWV Lifting Jack To assist us, the Army requests the following information be provided:  General Information: 	a.  Company Name: 	b.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Simplesync
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires renewal of the Simplesync Global Address List software maintenance and support. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to CPS Systems, 5675 S.W. Mapp Road, STE 100, Palm City, FL 34990. Interested parties may e-mail nathan.bowles@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, SrA Nathan Bowles, not later than Monday 14 September 2007; 10:00 a.m. EST.
Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:
22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within six days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

The Simplesync standard maintenance and support is developed by and owned by CPS Systems.   USSOCOM requires Simplesync to allow for the automated replication of GAL information to the Command, Components, Theater SOCs, Deployed Sites and numerous other DOD sites that the Command communicates with on a daily basis.  Use of this software is instrumental in ensuring accuracy to critical Command and Control resources.   A letter from CPS Systems dated 19 July 2007 states the following:
?SimpleSync is product which has been developed and is sold and supported ONLY by CPS Systems.  CPS Systems holds all rights to the original source code, as well as executables.
CPS Systems offers SimpleSync to all customers at the current list price in effect at the time of the sale.  CPS Systems offers support and product upgrades as part of its maintenance of SimpleSync.  No other company offers this support.?
CPS Systems thus has proprietary rights to the required source code and no other vendors can provide the maintenance service and upgrades required on the SimpleSync software.

<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
PLATO Software 
An Associative Database Management System

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercialize LLNL?s PLATO Software.

Background:. Plato is a desktop application that was designed to manage complex relationships between requirements in multiple contract documents used for design and contruction.  In addition, it was designed to deliver the information in a variety of formats: formatted documents, database records, drawing keynotes, or other custom formats as the need arose.  In its current version it is a general purpose application that can be adapted to almost any use.  General purpose, content management ?thinking tools? such as Plato are rare in the marketplace,  particularly in the desktop arena.  Similar technologies have included Lotus Agenda and  Ecco, and currently include UltraRecall and Zoot, but Plato?s functionality is unique.

Description:  Plato is a general purpose, associative database management system with which users can discover and manage relationships within data, as well as deliver formatted data in nearly any variety of markup relationships within data, as well as deliver formatted data in nearly any variety of markup language (e.g., XML, HTML, RTF, TeX, etc.).  

Advantages:  Features include user-definable database record templates; user-definable parsers for flexible data imports; user-definable scripts for flexible data output; and fast, simple associative modeling with bi-directional cross referencing and user-definable link types.

Potential Applications:  PLATO can run on any Pentium-class PC running Windows 98, 2000, XT, XP; 512 MB is the minimum memory recommended.

Development Status:  LLNL has filed for copyright registration.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  


Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's PLATO Software should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.  Company Name and address.
2.  The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information for X-Band Micro-Satellite Terminal
<DESC>Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The government requests industry respond with information concerning availability of an X band Micro-Sat terminal as described below: 1. Satellite Constellation: Target Satellite Constellation: Wide-band Global Satellite System (WGS) Alternate Satellite Constellation: XTAR a. The government requests industry indicate how the candidate terminal might operate on WGS. Include how the terminal will access WGS, how the terminal is technically suitable to operate on WGS (consideration for the manner in which WGS transponders alloc ate bandwidth), and any risk associated with operating the terminal on WGS. b. The government requests industry describe certification issue risk related to regulatory authorities when operating the terminal in the continental United States and throughout the world on the WGS satellite constellation. c. The government requests industry indicate how the candidate terminal might operate on XTAR. Include how the terminal will access XTAR, how the terminal is technically suitable to operate on XTAR, and any risk associated with operating the terminal on XT AR. d. The government requests industry describe certification issues related to regulatory authorities when operating the terminal in the continental United States and throughout the world on the objective XTAR constellation. e. The government requests industry provide information related to scalability of the candidate terminals considering the following scenarios for utilization on both WGS and XTAR: e.I. Number of terminals capable of operating duplex, simultaneously (one transponder) at 256 Kbps continuous data rate e.2. Number of terminals capable of operating duplex, simultaneously (one transponder) at 384 Kbps continuous data rate e.3. Number of terminals capable of operating duplex, simultaneously (one transponder) at 512 Kbps continuous data rate e.4. Number of terminals capable of operating duplex, simultaneously (one transponder) at 768 Kbps continuous data rate e.5. Number of terminals capable of operating duplex, simultaneously (one transponder) at 1024 Kbps continuous data rate e.6. Number of terminals capable of operating duplex, simultaneously (one transponder) at 1544 Kbps continuous data rate 2. MODEM: The government requests information on the modem to be used in the candidate terminal. The government prefers a TCP/IP interface. a. Request modem type and modulation protocols to be utilized b. Request industry describe how the modem and modem hub (if applicable) might accommodate multiple terminals operating on an WGS or XTAR transponder at varying data rates simultaneously. c. Request industry describe how the modem and modem hub (if applicable) might accommodate scenario 2.b as well as the addition of VSAT terminals ranging in size from .9 meter to 3.8 meter operating on an WGS or XTAR transponder at varying data rates and v arying antenna aperture sizes simultaneously. d. Request industry describe how the modem and modem hub (if applicable) might accommodate SATCOM on the move systems while supporting the candidate X band Micro-Sat terminals simultaneously e. The government is not tied to a government standard modem when operating on WGS 3. Satellite Architecture: The government intends to utilize government owned and operated teleports to host the X band Micro-Sat terminals on the WGS constellation. Terrestrial connectivity will carry data to the appropriate government head quarters. On X TAR, the government would locate appropriate commercial teleports to host the X band Micro-Sat terminals and provide terrestrial circuits to reach back to the appropriate head quarters. The government does not intend to implement a mesh network capability. 4. Intended Use: The government intends to utilize the candidate terminal as a replacement for 64 Kbps (HSD) and BGAN INMARSAT terminal systems. Terminals migh t be used on the battlefield to provide 256-1544 Kbps data connectivity to an individual soldier, inside office buildings or hotels, and on ground vehicular platforms. Terminals may also be used to exfil sensor data providing beyond line of site connectivi ty to a sensor or multiple sensors on the battlefield. Terminal characteristics should mimic the INMARSAT terminal model in form, fit, and function in as much as possible. Manual satellite acquisition is acceptable and may be preferred since size, weight, power, cost, and complexity will be reduced when utilizing a manual acquisition terminal. The government is not opposed to an auto acquisition terminal but a simple terminal design is preferred. Any auto acquisition terminal submitted for consideration mus t be simple to use, small and light weight. Parabolic or near parabolic antennas are acceptable. The government expectation regarding antennas is that the antenna will be segmented and collapse into the terminal package. 5. System Characteristics: The government envisions a system to be comprised of one terminal and one baseband package. The terminal should not be larger than 2750 cubic inches, not heavier than 15 Lbs, and capable of being carried with one hand. Smaller an d lighter is preferred. The baseband package is beyond the scope of information requested in this RFI. The government envisions a system capable of being carried by one soldier (terminal in one hand and base-band in the other). 6. Operational Scenarios: a. A squad has secured an enemy objective and is detaining several individuals. The squad leader needs positive identification of the detainees and has biometric capability on hand. Detainees biometric information is relayed to a Tactical Operations Center  via the X-band Micro-Sat terminal where access to a master data base is utilized to compare biometric information of detainees on the objective to data stored in a data base at the TOG. Data returns to the objective, the appropriate individuals are positi vely identified and transferred back to the C2 node as directed. All other detainees are registered in the data base and released. b. A staff officer has been dispatched to a location somewhere in the world to serve as a liaison officer to a supported head quarters location. The staff officer utilizes the X-band Micro-Sat terminal to provide information to the supported unit and send situation reports back to his/her higher headquarters. The staff officer routinely participates in video teleconferences using the Micro-Sat X-band terminal as the transmissions media. c. A squad is operating in a remote area and utilizes the Micro-Sat terminal to gain access to SIPRNET and the Common Operational Picture (COP) to gain situational awareness of the operating environment and C2 direction from a TOG beyond line of site of th e squad. d. A team is emplaced near an area of interest to gain intelligence information of the objective. A video camera relays full motion video back to a TOC providing intelligence and subsequently, situational awareness to an assault force prior to mission exec ution. 7. Terminal Set Up Scenarios: a. Terminal designed with integrated antenna: A communicator sets up the x-band terminal in an office environment with a window that has a view to the geosynchronous satellite Arc. The communicator sets the terminal on a table near the window, plugs the te rminals AC power connector into the power socket (world-wide auto sensing AC power interface). The operator folds out the antenna and utilizes a satellite slide rule to point the antenna / terminal in the general direction of the target satellite. The term inal has some indicator light emitting diodes that light up as the terminal receives stronger and stronger signals from the satellite. The communicator physically moves the terminal left and right to gain the strongest signal. The communicator adjusts the antenna up and down to gain the strongest receive signal strength. Multi-colored d iodes provide the communicator visual information so that the communicator knows the terminal is aligned to the satellite and has sufficient signal strength to close the link. The terminal has already been provisioned with the satellite provider and gains receive lock with the teleport hub. The teleport hub sends a command to the remote terminal allowing it to go into the transmit mode. Transmit power to the teleport hub is automatically adjusted for the appropriate EB/NO and transmit power from the hub is also automatically adjusted to the remote terminal for appropriate EB/NO at the remote terminal. No user intervention with a satellite provider was necessary since the X-band Micro-Sat terminal uses circular polarization. The terminal provides an indicator  light that show it has receive lock and an indicator light to show transmit lock and indicator light that the terminal is operating properly and is in the network. The operator connects the base band equipment via a strand of Ethernet cable and begins sen ding/receiving data. b. Terminal designed with a remote able antenna: Same as above except the terminal is located in a convenient location and only the antenna is placed in the window. This design allows for a set up where there is not enough real estate to physically locate the terminal on or near the window, this design also allows the terminal to remain in an area protected from environmental exposure such as rain, only exposing the antenna to the elements. c. Terminal designed with a remote able antenna or an ability to leave the antenna integrated onto the terminal. Same as 7.a. above but provides maximum flexibility for users. This type of design is preferred by the government. 8. Terminal Design Goals: The government requests information on availability of a candidate terminal that meets or closely meets the following criteria: a. Size: Terminal not to exceed 2750 cubic inches b. Weight: Not to exceed 15 Lbs. c. Power: Auto sensing world wide commercial power capability (threshold); 24 volts DC capability so that the terminal can be operated using BA-5590 battery pack as well as the capability to utilize threshold AC power input (objective). d. Packaging: All components integrated in the terminal. Terminal has a handle so that the operator can carry it with one hand. e. Environmental: The terminal will be utilized in harsh environments ranging from deserts to arctic conditions. The terminal needs to be capable of operation in rain, dust, and salt fog. f. Reliability: The terminal needs to be capable of continuous operation at the maximum data rate in the environmental conditions outlined in paragraph 8.e. 8.g. Antenna aperture size: Capable of storing in the 2750 cubic inch volume requested. Industry ma y respond with terminal variants; small antenna apertures /packages that support lower data rates and larger antenna apertures! packages that support higher data rates. The government envisions antenna apertures sizes ranging from 11-20 inches. 9. Production Capability: The government requests information from industry that demonstrates production capacity for candidate terminals. For a copy of a picture please email your request to jamie.kiser@tao.army.mil.  Responses to the RFI shall be provided to Jamie Kiser not later than 28 Sep 2007, any responses received after this date will not be reviewed.

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 test program procedures for commercial items.  Simplified acquisition procedures will be followed.  (ii)  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  (iii)  This combined synopsis/solicitation will result in a firm fixed price commercial supply contract.  (iv) This requirement is a small business set aside. The NAICS Code is 424130. The small business size standard is 100 employees, or less.  (v) The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect at the time of publication.  Provisions and clauses incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and AGAR can be accessed on the Internet at http://www.arnet.gov/far and http://www.usda.gov/procurement/policy/agar_x/agar04/index.html (vi) This requirement is for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Center for Plant Health Science Technology (CPHST) Otis Pest Survey and Detection and Exclusion Laboratory.  The CPHST supports PPQ regulatory decisions and operations through methods development work, scientific investigation, analyses and technology.  The USDA, APHIS, PPQ research and development work requires the acquisition of these cups and lids for the rearing of gypsy moth larvae.  (vii) REQUIREMENT AND QUANTITIES: This requirement consists of two (2) line items which are as follows: CLIN 001  - 200,000 Solo brand 6 oz translucent polystyrene plastic cups.  CLIN 002 - 210,000 Solo brand DS306 (04000) tab paper lids.  See below for the exact technical specifications for these two line items.  (viii) Shipping will be FOB destination, therefore, shipping of the items must be included in the price for all line items.  (ix)  The selected contractor must be able to deliver all requested equipment by November 15, 2007.  Deliverables and acceptance of the deliverables for the Solo cups and lids will be FOB destination USDA, APHIS, CPHST, Otis Method Development Center, Building 1398, Otis ANGB, MA  02542. (x) The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE for this contract is from date of award through delivery of all the supplies. (xi) OBJECTIVES: The Otis Pest Detection and Exclusion Laboratory has been rearing the gypsy moth larvae since the late 1970's.  This cup and lid combination was selected after numerous scientific studies were conducted with all containers and lids available at the time of testing.  Numerous tests have been performed throughout the 30+ production years.  This combination of cup-lid provides the optimum rearing environment for the production of healthy gypsy moth life stages.  These life stages are used by USDA researchers to develop techniques for use in managing gypsy moth population in the United States.  The successful production of the gypsy moth larvae enables the Otis rearing facility to supply gypsy moth life states to State, University, and foreign researchers.  Therefore, it is critical the USDA continue to purchase only this type of cup and lid for the Otis rearing operations since it is the only combination proven to successfully rear healthy gypsy moth life stages.  Any substitute container-lid combination would require Otis to evaluate these substitutions to determine their effect on the growth of gypsy moth.  This evaluation would require two generations of observations and would take a minimum of 14 months to complete.   (xii) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  The cups and lids requested in this solicitation must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable:  6 OZ POLYSTYRENE CUPS - The cup is constructed of 15 mil (plus or minus 2 mil) thermal formed polystyrene plastic. The plastic is translucid in that it lets the light pass but diffuses it so that objects on the other side cannot be clearly distinguished. The container has a 6 oz capacity. It has a squat type shape with a rolled lip. The outside height of the container is 2 1/16 inches; the mouth of the container has a 3 13/16 inch outside diameter; the base of the container has a 2 9/16 inch outside diameter. The sidewalls are fluted but that is not mandatory. However, eliminating the fluted sidewalls may result in the cup having to be made with a plastic that is greater than 15 mils to make it sturdy enough to support the hot insect diet poured into the cup.  TAB PAPER LID DS306 #04000  - The lid used in conjunction with the 6 oz cup is constructed of untreated white paperboard that has a nominal .026 inch thickness. The lid is flat and 3 9/16 inch diameter and has a tab for lifting purposes. The lid is poly-coated only on one side.  A lid that is poly-coated on both sides is NOT acceptable because it is not suitable for rearing Gypsy Moth in the 6 oz cup. This type of paper lid is critical for the survival of larvae within the 6 oz rearing cup.  Since there is a limited list of authorized distributors for the Solo Packaging company division, if providing a Solo product the vendor must provide written proof with their offer to verify their authorized status to obtain and provide these exact products.  The proof may come in the form of a letter from the Solo Packaging Division stating the said contractor has the authorized status to sell these products, therefore the USDA will have assurance the vendor can provide this product.  Vendors selling a brand name or equal product must provide a letter from their company or provider.
(xiii) The provision at 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial applies to this solicitation.  (xiv) The provision at 52.212-2  Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this solicitation. Award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable responsible offeror whose quote conforms to this solicitation. The cups and lids will be evaluated for technical capability as described in the Technical Specifications (xii) above.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award without discussion, however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions later if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.  (xv) The provision 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.  The contractor shall either complete the on-line Offeror Representations and Certifications or return a completed copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications with their quotation. The Online Reps and Certs Application Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) can be found at  http://www.bpn.gov., or a hard copy of the provision may be attained from http://www.arnet.gov/far.

Requirements for the High Spectral Resolution Automated Raman Microscope are as follow: 
To adequately probe the different diameter and thickness of materials the high resolution Raman spectrometer needs to be equipped with a number of different lasers, which are computer selectable. The system must also provide necessary spatial and spectral resolution used to resolve the unique structural properties commonly seen in high-end proprietary security features and separate closely positioned vibrational transitions found in specialized solid-state materials and nanomaterials. For optimum performance and flexibility, it is required that the Raman system has a directly coupled microscope. Key performance criteria for the Raman microscope are: 
1. Spectrograph 
Focal Length: minimum of 400mm. 
Spectral Resolution: better than 1.5cm-1 (0.75cm-1/pixel) at 585nm 
Gratings: at least four computer selectable-gratings simultaneously mounted 
Scanning: continuous scanning mode. 
2. Detectors: 
Detector Ports: have at least two detector ports to allow the system to be configured with two multichannel detectors simultaneously to cover from at least 200nm to at least 1700nm. 
CCD QE and Sensitivity: quantum efficiency (QE) that is at least 30% from 200nm to 900nm and have a peak QE of at least 60%. 
CCD chip size: The instrument offered must provide a 1 inch CCD chip 
3. Filters: The system must be configurable with up to four Raman filters simultaneously mounted and aligned in the spectrometer. 
4. Microscope: A directly coupled true confocal microscope, including at least a 10X, 50X and 100X microscope objective 
5. Macrochamber: A separate macrochamber as well as a microscope. 
6. Confocal performance: The instrument must use a continuously variable automated pinhole to allow for the confocal measurement volume to be set independently of the spectral resolution, 
7. Lasers: must allow for up to four lasers simultaneously and permanently mounted while aligned in the spectrometer for automated rapid and easy switching between each laser. 

? 785nm laser: at the time of purchase, the system must provide an internally mounted 785nm laser with at least 300mW of laser power and provide a one micron spot at the sample. 

? 633nm laser: at the time of purchase, the system must provide an internally mounted 633nm laser with at least 17mW of laser power. 

8. Line scanning: Laser excitation with line scanning to minimize surface ablation. 
9. Hyperspectral Imaging: Support the ability to perform hyperspectral images at a high spectral resolution. Exact positioning of the sample and mapping area is required ?

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support Division (PS)  provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM)  is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS)  develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).


INTRODUCTION

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) monitors humanitarian conditions, assesses disaster impacts and coordinates ongoing disaster assistance efforts overseas.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  To fulfill its mandate to respond to disasters worldwide on behalf of the U.S. Government (USG), DCHA/OFDA projects itself overseas in a variety of ways.  It has established five permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office.  The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica, Bangkok, Thailand, Dakar, Senegal, Nairobi, Kenya, and Pretoria, South Africa.  The sub-regional office is located in Katmandu, Nepal.  In countries where DCHA/OFDA has a large humanitarian response portfolio, it has established Program Offices within the USAID Mission or U.S. Embassy.  The Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Indonesia and Burundi have hosted D/CHAOFDA program offices.  In the event of major disasters, DCHA/OFDA may deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to the affected country.

The Overseas Administration Team (OAT) is part of OFDA's Operations Division (OFDA/OPS) which provides administrative oversight and support to the DCHA/OFDA Regional Offices and to all DCHA/OFDA personnel posted overseas.  This includes administrative support to DARTs, which deploy rapidly and can remain in a country for several months or longer.  The administrative aspects of personnel and property are essential elements to sustaining programs overseas.  In addition to supporting field operations, OAT is responsible for providing administrative oversight and support to RMTs at DCHA/OFDA headquarters.  Further, OAT maintains the primary source of DCHA/OFDA's surge capacity staffing, called the Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) mechanism.  This is a roster of up to 75 part-time Personal Services Contractors (PSCs). 

OBJECTIVE

DCHA/OFDA requires an Overseas Administration Team Leader to meet its program objectives and ensure that surge capacity staffing requirements are met. 

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Overseas Administration Team Leader will: 
* Recommend staffing patterns, personnel management and organizational structure for DCHA/OFDA overseas operations; ensure that overseas offices are staffed and structured in such a way as to maximize their human resources while remaining sufficiently flexible to meet the ever-changing demands of DCHA/OFDA;
* Provide expert advice to control inherent management vulnerabilities that emanate from implementing new initiatives, such as establishing new regional and DART offices, or deploying overseas humanitarian personnel.  Ensure that risks are minimized and that basic management principles and controls are reflected in the program design;
* Ensure that field activities are carried out in coordination with US Embassies and USAID Missions, and in accordance with USG law and USAID policies and regulations;
* Identify potential interaction and teamwork with existing overseas operations, such as with established USAID Missions, with Department of State operations, and with private contractors, to maximize support at the lowest possible management costs;
* Integrate logistical support systems with administrative support mechanisms.  Integrate the personnel systems of the USG and private sector entities when appropriate.  Coordinate personnel practices with other donors as needed;
* Establish and close-out  all administrative aspects of Regional Offices, Program Offices and DART operations as necessary; design and implement management procedures to facilitate transition and handover to USAID/Embassy offices;
* Design innovative management approaches that incorporate more formal relationships with implementing partners, i.e., other USG agencies, Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), International Organizations (IOs), the United Nations, multinational donors and other private sector entities;
* Exercise supervisory responsibility for the management component during the design phase as well as in the implementation of field programs;
* Supervise all non-direct hire overseas administration unit staff in Washington and in the field;
* Manage the RATS program which provides up to 75 part-time employees to the pool of personnel available to DCHA/OFDA for timely and effective emergency response;
* Serve as the primary interface on administrative matters between DCHA/OFDA and U.S. Embassies and USAID Missions;
* Travel to the field and to Missions to ensure that administrative operations are carried out in accordance with USAID regulations and policies.  Significant overseas travel is required for this position;
* Provide innovative solutions to resolve administrative issues as necessary;
* Serve as OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis;
* Serve as a member of Washington-based RMTs, which provide services and support to DARTs deployed in response to disasters.  Duties on RMTs will vary.

Services rendered by the YMD shall consist of providing a base wide religious program, and supporting specific youth ministry needs in addition to those provided by the Elmendorf Chapel Team or volunteers, organizations, and agencies.  The major scope of work required shall focus on conducting activities for the military dependent youth associated with the Elmendorf AFB community and to support the established programmed services of the Elmendorf Chapel Ministry, to include programming, developing and implementing youth activities and general Christian Religious Education.

1.2	Responsibilities.  The following program and support requirements are considered minimum elements of ministry to junior and senior high youth:  Responsibilities are based on a 20-hour workweek.

(BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION)



1.  Requiring Activity:  OL-A AFCESA/CEMIRT
				   P.O.C.: Major PETER DOMAHOSKI
				
2.  Contracting Agency: 60th Contracting Squadron, Travis AFB CA
     
3.  Purchase Request #:  F3ZT897243A001  

4.  Description of Requirement:  Purchase six Cummins automatic transfer switches (ATS) in multiple power capacities with the following minimum specifications: Type OTPC; 4-pole; 277/480-Volt; 60-Hertz; NEMA-3R enclosure. The Cummins ATS are essential systems necessary to upgrade emergency power distribution capabilities of several in-use CEMIRT Emergency Power Systems (CEPS) ranging in size from 500-kilowatt to 1.2-megawatt.  

5.  Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 8.405-6(b):   Only one responsible manufacturer and no other brand or services will satisfy the agency requirement.  This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program as defined in FAR 8.401.

6.  Justification or authority for action:

(a.)	The Cummins ATS is specifically designed to seamlessly interface with existing Cummins containerized emergency generator packages.  The Cummins ATS incorporates proprietary circuitry and controls, system monitoring, and electrical safety features necessary for precise transfer/re-transfer of emergency power to critical loads.  The Cummins ATS is a direct replacement item for the existing obsolete load transfer systems currently on the CEPS generators.  The Cummins ATS is designed as plug-n-play component for the Cummins CEPS; thus, require no modifications to install in the containerized mobile power plants.  The Cummins ATS also includes circuitry for a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) add-on module, enabling remote network connectivity for real-time command, control, and monitoring capability. CEMIRT is presently designing and installing SCADA systems in critical Air Force-owned utility facilities around the globe. 
(b.)	Cummins or affiliate Cummins/Onan distributors are the only known source that can satisfy the government?s requirement.  There is no other product on the market designed specifically for the semi-proprietary CEPS equipment.  It is imperative that each ATS fully integrate with the in-use engine/generator configuration, ancillary equipment and associated electrical distribution and control software.
(c.)	Cummins fixed and mobile power generation/switching equipment are standardized throughout the Air Force. Most notably, the electrical branch of the Air Force civil engineering technical training schoolhouse, located at Sheppard AFB, utilizes Cummins/Onan power systems in their basic and advanced troubleshooting courses; making the Cummins/Onan brand familiar to a vast majority of personnel required to operate and maintain the CEPS when dispatched to supported agencies.  Purchase of non-Cummins ATS would require significant expenditure to re-design or modify existing hardware and circuitry to adapt the systems to the CEPS.  This alone would contribute to costly and unacceptable project delays.

7.  Market Research/ Other Facts:  Additional market research was conducted by unit technical specialists during product research. These unit members are continually involved in acquisition, installation, and training of Cummins/Onan systems and similar products. Based on their extensive knowledge, the requested automatic transfer switches will 1) expedite installation, troubleshooting, and maintenance of in-use Cummins/Onan containerized power packages; 2) minimize downtime by providing technicians a single point of contact for field support--versus contacting several different equipment providers; 3) capitalize on member knowledge of existing equipment and minimize funding required for training. 

8.  Steps to improve competition:   Unit technical experts continue to review and evaluate existing technologies while researching newer power producing and distributing innovations.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Title:  Conduct commercialization assessments of seven technologies developed at the NIST Labs.
BACKGROUND

While the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) scientists conduct breakthrough research that leads to the innovations expressed in its patent portfolio, the range of NIST effort does not extend to product development in any of its research areas.  The remaining work needed to fully exploit NIST patented technologies for commercial viability necessarily requires innovation on behalf of the private sector.  NIST wants to identify business opportunities in the form of potential licensees and/or partners that would be in a position to commercialize each of the seven (7) NIST technologies.
SCOPE OF WORK
The contractor shall use his technical and business expertise to identify the optimum pathway(s) to successful commercialize seven (7) NIST patented technologies that are listed below:
1)	Method of Stabilization of Functional Nanoscale Pores for Device Applications, 05-009, Kasianowicz, John J., Shenoy, Devanand K.,  Singh, Alok,  Barger, Willam R.

2)	Zeroeth Order Imaging, 06-003, Silver, Richard M., Attota, Ravikiran, Larrabee, Robert D.

3)	Process For The Removal Of Carbonyl Sulfide From Liquid Petroleum Gas, 98-030, Bruno; Thomas J., Lagalante; Anthony F.

4)	Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy System Using Differential Heterodyne Detection, 00-005, Ye; Jun, Hall; John L.

5)	Length Separation Of Carbon Nanotubes By Centrifugation In A Dense Liquid, 07-012, Fagan, Jeffrey Alan, Becker, Matthew

6)	Photovoltaic Solar Water Heating System, 91-023, Fanney; A. Hunter, Dougherty; Brian P.

b. Project History:  DDNV provides logistic support to the Atlantic Fleet. DDNV has 25 storage buildings with over 50 pieces of MHE.  The types of equipment they have are Raymond stock selectors, turret trucks and dockstockers, Drexel swing mast vehicles, Landoll pivot mast vehicles, and 4K and 6K forklifts.  Bldgs. W-143, Y-109, W-135 and W-148 are the heart of the Industrial Complex.  The back-up storage facilities are X-134, X-136, X-218, and V-52.  The majority of the buildings have columns on 20 ft. centers and W-143, X-134 and X-136 have freight elevators to transport receipts and issues via forklift to multiple storage floors.

DDNV has severe problems with forklift impact to storage racks, elevator doors, building columns, overhead doors, fire doors and conveyor systems.  DDNV needs a system that will identify the operator when a vehicle impacts the items above, shuts down use of the vehicles until it is reset by the maintenance department or warehouse supervisor, maintains a log of the offenders with the time, date and location of the accident and the duration of time the vehicle is locked out until the vehicle is reset.

The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1).

The contractor must provide a drawing that shows a basic electrical schematic on how the system will be wired in the forklift vehicle.  Contractors must also submit descriptive literature.  "Descriptive literature" for this for this solicitation means catalog cuts, illustrations, drawings, pictures, brochures or a web address that contains applicable product information.  Descriptive Literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the products offered that are specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design; (2) materials; (3) components; (4) performance characteristics; and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction, or operations.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  The contractor shall also include past performance information that clearly indicates the contractor is qualified and technically capable to provide the material in accordance with the attached specifications.

FAR 52-212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items
(a)  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Proposals shall be evaluated only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following two (2) non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:  Factor 1-Technical capability and Factor 2-Past Performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If a proposal has been determined acceptable (go) on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal, and who has either been found to have a satisfactory past performance history, no relevant past performance history, or for whom no past performance information is available, will then have its proposal evaluated for the lowest price.

Factor 1 - Technical capability-The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of information that clearly indicates the system being offered complies with all technical requirements in the Statement of Work.

Factor 2 - Past Performance-By past performance the Government means the offerors record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offerors adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offerors reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offerors business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In evaluating an offerors past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offerors proposal and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.  The information provided should reflect similar contracts for the same or similar type products.

(End of provision)

FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items Alternate I.  Offerors must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial items with their proposal or indicate that the registration has been completed at the ORCA website http://www.orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include this information with the quotation will render an offeror ineligible for award.

<DESC>RFQ VA-101-07-RQ-0408  Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) This is a combined/synopsis solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12 and 15, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation will incorporate provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-04.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 813920 with a standard restriction of $6.5 million.  The contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials and equipment required to MONITOR AND EVALUATE HOW CONSISTENTLY THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA) IACUC'S MEETS THE REGULATORY AND FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES GIVEN IT BY VA POLICY AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS. The following is an overview of the Statement of Work (SOW).  Please contact Corinthia Price at corinthia.price@va.gov for a copy of the SOW.  You must include in your request the Request for Quote (RFQ) number and the title. Consistent with its critical role as the institution's self-regulatory body, each institutional IACUC has the following basic charges: &quot;	Uphold and maintain the tenets of the most current Department of Veterans Affairs Handbook governing animal research (1200.7), the USDA Animal Welfare Act Regulations (AWAR), and the Public Health Service (PHS) policies.  &quot;	Provide impartial initial review of any protocol involving the use of animals within the institution. &quot;	Provide reviews of all modification requests to established and approved protocols involving the use of animals. &quot;	Provide assurance that staff and investigators are trained in current best practices in laboratory animal management and the humane care and use of laboratory animals. &quot;	Assure that all staff coming into contact with research animals are protected through a current and comprehensive occupational health and safety policy. &quot;	Provide a comprehensive, semi-annual review of the programmatic and physical infrastructure, including all locations which may be used to conduct VA animal research or house VA research animals. &quot;	Review and approve Standard Operating Procedures for the animal research facility. &quot;	Interpret and provide guidance to local research staff on any regulatory questions or concerns.   &quot;	Respond to all animal research related concerns on a station level. &quot;	Provide aid and assistance to the staff veterinarian, animal facility staff and Institutional Review Board (IRB) members on any animal or regulatory matter brought before the board, to include issues of potential mistreatment and protocol noncompliance. &quot;	Provide reports and feedback to the hospital Director regarding the state of the program and any corrective measures needed to ensure quality and compliance. Both VA policy (found in Handbook 1200.7) and the AWAR and the PHS Policy describe specific authorities and responsibilities for the IACUC. VACO and the CVMO make all efforts to monitor all elements of a stations research program.  Collectively however, these efforts have a weakness in that they only represent &quot;snapshots&quot; of IACUC function at points in time, and do not necessarily evaluate the ability of an IACUC to sustain a level of local monitoring and oversight needed to ensure a consistently high quality program.  Specifically, they do not allow VACO to evaluate the IACUC's ability to complete an entire monitoring &quot;cycle&quot; (identify problems, identify solutions and corrections, and ensure the timeliness and effectiveness of corrections) nor evaluate if the IACUC's documentation of business conducted at meetings and documentation available for specific projects is adequate. Such evaluations are difficult to perform without on-site evaluations.     Accordingly, the general scope of this contract is an evaluation of how consistently the IACUC meets the regulatory and functional responsibilities given it by VA policy and federal regulations.  Consistent with the concept of self-regulation, the IACUC must:  1.6.1	Review proposed uses of animals and ensure that such use is consistent with policies and regulations, and document the review in minutes and other documents to provide confidence that adequate review is being performed. 1.6.2	Monitor ongoing animal research to ensure that studies are being conducted as approved, and document monitoring activities. 1.6.3 	Identify deviations from policy and regulation, document them, develop a corrective plan and timeline, then monitor to ensure that corrective actions have been effective and timely. 1.6.4	Communicate with both investigators and the medical center Director as needed to ensure transparency and foster an environment where self-regulation can be optimally effective. 1.7.3.	The overall goal is for the contractors to get a sense of: A.	IACUC organization and general management; Level of IACUC effectiveness in the review of investigator requests for use of animals in biomedical or rehabilitative research within the VA B.	Level of IACUC effectiveness in the management of new and on-going investigator requests for use of animals in biomedical or rehabilitative research within the VA C.	Level of IACUC effectiveness in monitoring the overall animal research program. D.	Level of IACUC effectiveness in monitoring the animal research facility (both infrastructure and physical assets). E.	Level of IACUC effectiveness in the identification of programmatic and facility deficiencies. F.	Level of IACUC effectiveness in the formulation and execution of plans for corrective action toward identified deficiencies. G.	Level of IACUC effectiveness in response to issues involving both the animal program, the users of the program or over-arching issues with biomedical research involving animals. H.	Level of IACUC knowledge in current best practices and regulations involving animal programs. 1.7.4	Reporting.  These reports shall be due no later than three (3) weeks after each site visit has been concluded.  Reports which are not received within eight (8) weeks after site visit shall be considered seriously delinquent and may endanger the remaining completion of the contract. The contract shall be completed and all reports delivered to the Director, Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development Service (121) no later than eighteen months (18) from the date of first document submission request.  If IACUCs or Medical Centers do not provide relevant documents in a timely fashion, the VA, Biomedical Laboratory Research &amp; Development Service will provide assistance in the gathering of requested background materials. The following deliverables will be expected by the VA: 2.1	The contractor will gather applicable materials for a pre-review of internal IACUC processes (these materials will include items described in section 1.7.1 plus others as deemed appropriate by the contractors) 2.2	The contractor will review requested materials, determine site visit timeframes and assemble an appropriate visit team to address issues below:	 2.2.1	Internal Functioning and Management of the IACUC: 2.2.1.1	Appropriate management processes and internal controls for the IACUC. 2.2.1.2	Project Management and planning performance for both the IACUC and the animal program. 2.2.1.3	Project Management and planning performance for occupational health and training. 2.2.1.4	Ratio of successful conversions from metrics and written regulations to program functionality. 2.2.1.5	Demonstration of successful and clearly defined relationships with internal and external review groups (Research and Development Committee, Biosafety Committee, Medical Center Radiation Safety Committee, CVMO, AAALAC and any affiliated institutions). 2.2.2	IACUC review and monitoring of hospital functions shall include, but not be limited to: 2.2.2.1	Appropriate review and monitoring of the animal facility physical plant (to include off-site labs and research holding areas). 2.2.2.2	Appropriate review and monitoring of the animal facility assets (personnel, capitalized and non-capitalized equipment and station support staff)  2.2.2.3	Appropriate review and input into costing practices (primarily review of per diem setting practices). 2.2.2.4	Appropriate review and monitoring of study and programmatic documentation. 2.2.3	Evaluation and Review Functions will include, but not be limited to: 2.2.3.1.	Review of compliance with all VA and Federal regulations 2.2.3.2	Review of compliance with all industry standards (i.e. Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International, American Association for Laboratory Animal Science and other groups.) 2.2.3.3.	Evaluation of understanding and responsiveness to changes in Industry Standards. 2.2.3.4.	Evaluation of understanding and responsiveness to changes in regulatory requirements. 2.3	Once the site visit has been performed, the team will be responsible for providing to the  VA a final document on findings and recommendations. 2.4	Upon completion of ALL site visits the contractor will provide a summary document which will detail the programmatic trends and suggested corrections, if any.  2.5	This final summary document MUST be submitted within eight (8) weeks from the date of final site visit. 2.6	All materials collected during the course of the site visit preparations are the property of the VA and must be handled in a confidential and secure manner.  The contractor must outline in their response, planned methods for handling and securing of paper and electronic documents. 2.7	All materials and reports generated during the course of the contract will become the sole property of the VA.   2.8	All materials collected and generated during the course of the contract will be returned to the VA for either destruction or appropriate records management.    IACUC Evaluation Factors In reviewing any bids or proposals the following elements must be evaluated, in lieu of sole use of best price.  	Technical merit- The vendor must be able to demonstrate through recent projects/programs that perquisites knowledge, skills and abilities in monitoring Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) exist.  The vendor must also be able to demonstrate a current working knowledge of all appropriate federal and industry regulations pertaining to Animal Research and IACUC composition. 1.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG23-07-R-TE4213 is hereby amended to respond to the following questions received by the deadline of 12:00 Noon EDT on Monday, September 10, 2007.

QUESTION 1: Section A, Item 4.  Shall be equipped with DES-CFB, DES-OFB and AES Encryption:
DES-CFB and DES-OFB encryption is contradictory with FIPS publication 140.  DES-CFB and DES-OFB encryption modes do not meet the requirements of FIPS-140 as of May, 2007.  According to NIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1 Transition Plan for the Use of Key Sizes and Security Strengths by Federal Agencies?  After the transition period ending on May 19, 2007: 
a. The use of keys of less than 80-bits of security strength shall not be allowed for use in a FIPS Approved mode of operation for use by Federal agencies. 
b.  A minimum of 80-bits of security strength shall be required through 2010. 
c.  From 2011 through 2030, a minimum of 112 bits of security strength shall be required. 
d. Thereafter, at least 128 bits of security strength shall be required. 
It is our understanding that this policy is in place to prevent discussing sensitive information using less than secure communication channels.  It is better for the user to understand the communication channel is unsecured than to have a false sense of security.
The requirement for DES-CFB and DES-OFB (56-bit key) encryption should be removed because it is not allowed for use by Federal Agencies.  Removing DES-CFB will also expand the number of commercially available products that are otherwise acceptable for this RFP.
Will the government eliminate the requirement for DES-CFB and DES-OFB?

ANSWER 1: No.  The government requires the capability to maintain communications with legacy equipment using DES encryption.  Coast Guard and other government agencies continue to operate DES-encrypted radio systems under waivers of the NIST publication cited above.

QUESTION 2: Section A, Item 11.  Shall be capable of upgrading to Project 25 Trunking:
Will the government accept replacement of the radio at a reduced price as an alternative to upgrading?

ANSWER 2: No.  Replacement of radios will increase the Government?s cost to deploy and maintain these radios.

QUESTION 3: Section A, item 14.  Shall have a minimum of 500 channels:  
This requirement eliminates a number of commercially available products that may otherwise meet the technical aspects of the solicitation.  
Will the government consider a product that offers 400 channels to be acceptable?

ANSWER 3: No.  The minimum requirement is 500 channels.

QUESTION 4: Section C, Item 2:  Multiple?Radio charger capable of charging 6 radios simultaneously.
This requirement appears tailored to a particular radio vendor.  Multi-Radio chargers are offered by various radio vendors that charge 4, 5 or 6 radios simultaneously.  
Will the government consider 4, 5 or 6 unit Multi-Radio chargers acceptable?

ANSWER 4: Yes.  

QUESTION 5: Can the government provide anticipated contract award date, expected initial delivery order date and expected quantity of units in initial delivery order?

ANSWER 5: It is anticipated that an award and the initial delivery order will be made by the end of this Fiscal Year. It is estimated that a minimum of 1000 radios will be initially ordered.

QUESTION 6: Section 1 Technical Capability:  The proposal should outline an effective, efficient and achievable capability for accomplishing the work within the timeline specified by either performance periods or documented in a deliverable schedule.

Can the government provide more details or examples of the information desired?

ANSWER 6: Answer: The criterion remains as stated.

QUESTION 7: Proposal Submission Section:  ??first binder shall contain your Technical and Relevant Price Performance information?
Did the government mean Relevant Past Performance information?

ANSWER 7: Yes

QUESTION 8: We consider that we have a realistic solution to the specification included in the RFP; however we recognize the need to gather specific internal commitments and we need more time.  Can we be granted a one-week extension to responding to this request?

ANSWER 8: No. The Coast Guard intends to make an award by the end of this fiscal year, hence the need to keep to the current proposal deadline as posted.

QUESTION 9: Is there a minimum order quantity the Coast Guard will procure through the single award.  There was some confusion regarding the $21.5M figure associated with 9500 units.

ANSWER 9: As stated in the solicitation, this will be a Requirements Contract for a period of 24 months with at approximate total of $21.5M. It is estimated that a minimum of 1000 radios will be initially ordered.

SUBJECT:  Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for an Overseas Administration Team (OAT) Leader (GS-14) in Washington, DC.

The purpose of this Amendment is to provide the Attachments referenced in the main solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

	MORTGAGE LOAN PERFORMANCE DATABASE ACCESS
I.  INTRODUCTION 
	Within the Office of Housing in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Office of Evaluation (OE) is responsible for the risk assessment of HUD-insured and -assisted single family and multifamily properties.  
	
Specifically, this procurement is for an annual subscription of mortgage loan performance database access.  Subscription includes:

1>	Residential Mortgage Loan Level Database both Prime and Subprime, 
2>	Mortgage Loan Delinquency Database both Prime and Subprime, 
3>	5 years of Market History and Access both Prime and Subprime.

Product and price proposals are sought from any company containing the following mortgage loan performance data for residential loans:

HUD is seeking access to a large residential mortgage database or databases for the United States that can provide risk analysis.  The database HUD is seeking should have a minimum of 35,000,000 loans and should be updated each month from loan level data provided by 9 of the top 10 loan servicers and both Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs).  A minimum of 75% of the active mortgages in the US should be represented in each of the databases that HUD is seeking.  The data sought represents residential mortgage delinquency and a residential mortgage servicing for both prime and subprime loans with a minimum of 5 years of history.

Loan performance data must contain but not limited to - the following fields: 

Credit score
Data period
Delinquency status
Debt-to-income ratio (DTI)
Geography (to include Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), Region, State and zip code
Interest rate
Loan balance
Loan-to-value ratio
Origination date
Prepayment penalty
Loan type loan term
Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) indicator
Property type
Spread
Loan age
Loan payment frequency
Loan purpose
Loan status
Risk  grade
Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) delinquency index and data
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) delinquency index and data

A description of the databases for subscription access, including the field names and record layout, are required.  In addition, several names of U.S. Government customers who have purchased the databases in the last several years is sought by HUD.
II. BACKGROUND
Apart from its involvement in single family and multifamily risk assessment and risk scoring, the Office of Evaluation (OE), located in the Office of Finance and Budget in the Office of Housing, is responsible for monitoring the performance of FHA?s single family and multifamily programs.  The Office of Evaluation prepares periodic reports for the FHA Commissioner on FHA business activities and oversees the statutorily mandated annual actuarial review of FHAs largest insurance fund.  OE is also responsible for assessing the financial impact on FHAs insurance funds of new or revised programs and policies, and for evaluating relationships between current economic and market conditions and FHA program goals and objectives.
With the advent of credit reform, the OE has become responsible for developing, maintaining, and updating cash flow models used to estimate credit subsidy rates for FHAs budget and liability for loan guarantee for FHAs annual financial statement.  These cash flow models use historical data for loans grouped into risk categories to calculate the net present value of cash flows over the life of a book of business.  Cash flows are estimated for premiums, claims, and recoveries.  A credit subsidy rate for each risk category is calculated by dividing the net present value of cash flows by projected endorsements.  If the credit subsidy rate is positive, FHA needs appropriations of credit subsidy (as well as commitment authority) before it can endorse new loans.  Under this procurement, HUD is seeking comprehensive data on conventional home loans.  This database assistance will allow 1) superior single family risk assessments and 2) more program and related data available to program managers to help improve program performance, hold down costs, and increase the effectiveness with which HUD can maintain and increase the supply of affordable housing.  As additional data become available, HUD also wishes to enhance the effectiveness of its portfolio risk assessment though the development of an outcome-based statistical model. Whereas the current model measures generic current financial health of individual properties, the outcome-based model will measure the likelihood of a well-defined outcome (such as default, delinquency, loan loss, etc.) and be more predictive of losses to HUD. This new model will serve as the base for an early warning system (for financial distress of the multifamily properties) that can be used by Headquarters and field staff to prioritize their assessment management activities.  Combined with other data, it will serve as a basis for performance indicators and for policy analysis aimed to improve multifamily underwriting, focus asset management, and reduce insurance losses while promoting affordable rental housing.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide questions and answers on this project. i.	If dirt is excavated, it shall be disposed of in the landfill?  On the base or at the county landfill?  The base landfill. ii.	Drainage requirements? If the soil does not perc, slope to drain and then run drainage to a headwall.  How will we determine whether or not the soil percs.  This information is normally determined by DPW.  DPW responded that the contractor will be requ ired to do their own perc test on the site.  There are issues with this, unless further notified please assume drainage requirements are not an issue. iii.	What is the deck height you want for the slides?  This is appropriate for a 2-5 structure, but not challenging or interesting to a 5-12 yo.  Please disregard early specification for 36 slides and design playground slides that will are appropriate for  the different age groups. iv.	Poured in place rubber might not be what you want.  It will wear out under the swings.  Interlocking tiles which have a 10 year warranty would be a recommendation.  The warranty on the poured in place is only a couple of years.  The customer has reques ted that quotes be prepared with a price for the poured in place rubber, with an alternative pricing for the rubber interlocking tiles. v.	How many bays are required?  (There are 2 seats per bay, and they must be the same to meet code-so, 2 ADA would be in one bay, 2 infant would be an additional bay, 2 belt seats an additional bay, etc.)  The Government is wishing to purchase playground e quipment to accommodate children with or without disabilities from ages 2-12.  The minimum requirement is two swings, however, it is doubtful that 2 swings would be able satisfy the different age groups.  Please provide an offer for all items requested tha t will satisfy all of the age groups. vi.	What base do you want under the poured in place rubber surfacing, concrete or stone?  The Government has not expressed a preference, we are requesting only industry standard. vii.	What color content is preferred for the rubber surfacing?  No preferred color. viii.	Is wood fiber acceptable for the swing area? No. ix.	Do you want the entire 150 x 150 area to have safety surfacing, or only the area needed for the fall zone requirements?  No the entire area is not applicable, only the area used for the playground. x.	Is it okay to have the swings and the playground area separated?  They need to be in one general area, the children should not have to leave one play area to go to another. xi.	Do you want any roof tops on the play structure? No. xii.	Submission of quotes shall be forwarded by Friday, September 21, 2007 at 12:00 pm.  Please provide the following information with your offer: The playground is in compliance with ADA and playground industry, and that it meets the requirements of a Bou ndless Playground (Not requesting a Boundless Playground).  Also please show how the playground will accommodate 80-100 children, age level 2-12, and accommodate wheel chairs and walking sticks.
