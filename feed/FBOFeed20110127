CLAUSE INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT
FAR 52.209-1 Qualification Requirements (Feb 1995)(a) Definition. "Qualification requirement," as used in this clause, means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed before award.(b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.		OC-ALC/BC		ATTN:  SOURCE DEVELOPMENT OFICE		3001 STAFF DRIVE STE 1AG85A		TINKER AIR FORCE BASE, OK 73145-3009		405-739-7244 OR 405-739-7243
 (c) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service covered by a qualification requirement has already met the standards specified, the relevant information noted below should be provided.Offeror's Name _______________________________Manufacturer's Name __________________________Source's Name _______________________________Item Name __________________________________Service Identification __________________________Test Number ______________________________ (to the extent known)(d) Even though a product or service subject to a qualification requirement is not itself an end item under this contract, the product, manufacturer, or source must nevertheless be qualified at the time of award of this contract. This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract. Unless determined to be in the Government's interest, award of this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit evidence of qualification.(f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed requires reevaluation of the qualification. Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification. The reevaluation must be accomplished before the date of award.52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers:
1.	Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement2.	Past Performance 3.	Cost/Price
Technical and past performance, when combined are approximately equal to cost or price.
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This synopsis describes the acquisition strategy and upcoming solicitation for the Army Enterprise Service Desk (AESD) Spiral 2 requirement for CONUS and OCONUS services in support of the U.S. Active, Guard, and Reserve Army, Department of Army Civilians and entitled Contractors, Friends, and Family.
The Army is transitioning towards a service management model which promotes a total customer focus in order to better deliver Information Technology (IT) services to the Warfighter.  The Enterprise Service Desk / Enterprise Support Management System (ESD/ESMS), based upon the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework, are critical enablers of this service management paradigm.  
As the Army begins to operationalize LandWarNet (LWN) on a global scale, unifying theater-based operations for the delivery of Information Technology (IT) services through regional Network Service Centers (NSCs), there is a continuing need for an Army-wide ESD across a number of subordinate and federated organizations to ensure reliable IT service support to LWN IT service consumers.  
This ESD will be implemented incrementally, and it is envisioned that each ESD increment will support a larger portion of LWN IT Services until all services are supported.  The ESD is enabled by an underlying Enterprise Support Management System (ESMS).  The ESMS has two primary roles.  First, the ESMS has codified workflows supporting the ITIL processes of incident, problem, change, and configuration management. These workflows ensure that Service Support is executed in a repeatable manner across the Enterprise.  Second, it contains asset inventory data, performance data, capacity data, and data about relationships to other assets, people, and services.  These data facilitate the ESD's LWN service support mission.
The Enterprise Service Desk, based on the principles of the ITIL V3 framework, is the single point of entry for all IT support services for LandWarNet.  The ESD, supported by the ESMS and the related services required for continued and effective operation of this critical Army capability are collectively known as the Army Enterprise Service Desk or AESD.  
To meet this critical mission the Government intends to award a five (5) year, multiple-award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract competed via Full-and-Open competition in accordance with FAR Part 15 The scope of this multiple-award IDIQ Contract will include Task Order Management, Transition and Migration Planning and Execution, Enterprise Service Desk, Call Handling Solution, Distributed Dispatch and Field Support, ESD Fielding, ESMS Fielding, Enterprise Support Management System Development, Configuration, and Release Management, Enterprise Support Management System (ESMS) Operations Support, and ESMS Platform Hosting.  The Government then intends to compete various Task Orders amongst these Contract holders unless an exception to Fair Opportunity is appropriate.  
The competed Task Orders will vary in scope and duration but many will be of five (5) years duration with two (2) year base periods and three (3) one-year options.  Within this structure Contractors performing successfully from a technical and price perspective may see options exercised and the continuation of their Task Order performance.  Contractors failing to perform may see the Government elect not to exercise Task Order options and to instead re-compete the Task Order scope amongst all IDIQ Contract Holders.  At a minimum, Task Orders to be competed immediately upon contract award will include (1) a Call Handling Solution requirement, (2) an Enterprise Service Management System (ESMS) Development and Operations requirement, and (3) Service Desk requirements in multiple, parallel Task Orders.
The evaluation of Offeror proposals for award of the IDIQ contracts will place significant emphasis on a technical solution and implementation approach to the Army's immediate and evolving Call Handling Solution requirement through the use of a Sample Task Order.  Additionally, significant evaluation weight will be placed on Offeror's Past Performance, Corporate Experience, and Certification across the scope of the Contract and viable Offerors and their Teams will have substantial, relevant Past Performance, Corporate Experience, and Certifications in the majority of the scope areas.  Furthermore, and due to the Task Order industrial security requirements, the DD-254 posted to accompany the Contract Performance Work Statement will stipulate a Top Secret facility clearance (FCL) as a requirement and therefore a condition of Contract award.
The Government intends to release a solicitation in mid- to late February with proposals due in mid- to late March.  The Government intends to award the IDIQ Contracts on Initial Proposals unless extraordinary circumstances require Discussions.  
The information provided above reflects the Government's current intentions but is subject to change.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Lorita_M_Mills@nbc.gov.

<DESC>BACKGROUND.<br />The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to continue supporting the NIDDK Genetics Repository. The repository will allow the continued storage, maintenance, and quality control, and equitable, ethical distribution of DNA and other resources important to the study of diseases under the mandate of the NIDDK. It facilitates sharing of resources, thus encouraging work by a broad group of investigators and perhaps, increasing the sample size and the resulting power of a study to identify the genetic determinants of a disease. It helps to ensure that research participants will be making a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts. The current contractor is the Rutgers State University, Contract No. HHSN267200800018C.
<p>The cell immortalization and other tasks are highly technical, and require extensive experience and expertise. The success rate for cell immortalization is extremely variable depending on how well the established methods are implemented as well as on the quality and volume of the initial blood sample. As the value of many genetics studies rests on the ability to analyze the DNA of relatives, inability to recover DNA from any particular sample may negate the value of multiple samples. In addition, samples collected from pediatric patients may be very small, but valuable and irreplaceable. Therefore, it is essential that the success rate for establishing cell lines be as close to 100% as possible. Furthermore, the ability to track thousands of genetic samples, preventing sample mix-ups and cross-contamination while maintaining a high-throughput processing system, is crucial to the integrity of the studies being supported. The Contractor's project director must have extensive experience in successfully providing these genetics and sample processing services, including blood cell immortalization and DNA extraction and distribution, to a large group of investigators. The Contractor's staff must be highly trained to carry out exacting technical tasks accurately and reproducibly. As all the work is with samples is from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples. Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.<br />The objective of this acquisition is to continue the NIDDK Genetics Repository to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:</p>
<p>&bull; Receive blood samples from NIDDK funded grants;<br />&bull; Process these data and materials to create cell lines, cryopreserved lymphocytes, and/or DNA or RNA samples;<br />&bull; Receive externally produced immortalized lymphocyte cell lines; and <br />&bull; Widely distribute all materials to qualified investigators in the scientific community in a variety of customized formats.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS.<br />&bull; Establish biospecimen preparation, shipping, receipt, and tracking systems for numerous individual multi-center clinical studies;</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from samples;</p>
<p>&bull; Establish one or more subcontracts for timely and cost-effective shipping of biosamples between multiple sites and the repository;</p>
<p>&bull; Create and store viable cell lines via Epstein-Barr virus transformation of lymphocytes from blood samples, with a success rate of 98% or greater and expanding the lymphoblastoid cell lines;</p>
<p>&bull; Receive and store lymphoblastoid cell lines prepared at other facilities and carry out quality control assessments;</p>
<p>&bull; Cryopreserve blood cells for eventual transformation and/or DNA extraction;</p>
<p>&bull; Extract and store DNA from cell lines or from isolated blood cells and, with designated samples, separating the white blood cells (buffy coat) from the plasma;</p>
<p>&bull; Carry out limited genotyping for verifying sample identity and quality;</p>
<p>&bull; Distribute cell lines and biosamples to investigators granted access by the Project Officer, including arraying in a variety of formats, packaging, handling, and coordinating sample shipments to domestic and international sites;</p>
<p>&bull; Withdraw and destroy samples from the repository as directed in writing by the Project Officer;</p>
<p>&bull; Establish and maintain Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide security and back-up systems and a plan for disaster recovery;</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain high quality, secure information systems to allow detailed tracking and reporting of sample receipt, processing, storage and distribution, rapid retrieval of samples, storage of QA/QC information associated with the sample, seamless interaction with the Database Repository, and listing of investigators using the repository;</p>
<p>&bull; Work in a cooperative fashion with the Project Officer, the External Advisory Committee, and the Steering Committee.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.<br />A base year plus four one year option periods is anticipated.<br /><br />It is anticipated that Request for Proposal No. NIHLM2011122 for the NIDDK Genetics Repository will be issued at the fedbizopps website, <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>, on or about February 11, 2011. Proposals will be due on or about March 29, 2011. This competition will be conducted using full and open competition procedures.</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The Naval Air Weapons Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) intends to award a sole source Bridge extension to contract # N00421-06-C-0074 with CACI Systems, 14370 Newbrook Dr, Chantilly, VA, 20151 for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) supporting C4ISR electronic systems and subsystems that are used by combat support agencies to communicate with deployed staff and assets. The original contract type is a Cost plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract. In addition, a 12 month Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) extension was awarded on 16 May 2010. This requirement will result in the modification of subject contract providing for an extended period of performance running from 16 May 2011 to 31 October 2011. Without the services provided by this contract, there would be a severe negative effect on SCR's ability to maintain the current wartime operational tempo and deployment schedules of the various communication systems.. <br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The incumbent contractor (CACI Systems) currently has fully trained personnel and a fully developed management system in place for execution the required work, resolicitation for the twelve month period would not only risk a break in service, but would incur excessive costs to the government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Additionally the LAP personnel must be specially trained to work with explosives.  For each step of the manufacturing process, sophisticated test and measuring equipment is required to ensure the final products comply with Government requirements.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining equipment, anodize and phosphate systems, ultrasonic and x-ray test equipment and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.  A ballistic test range must be available to perform First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests on these cartridges.  Other critical skills required to manufacture these 25mm and 30mm cartridges include, but are not limited to:  ammunition process/design engineers, explosive experts, set-up mechanics and operators, quality control engineers, certified ultrasonic and x-ray technicians, metallurgists and ballistics test personnel.<BR><BR>Specifications: The 25mm M793 TP-T, 25mm M910 TPDS-T, 25mm PGU-23/U TP, 25mm PGU-25/U HEI, 25mm PGU-32/U SAPHEI-T, and the 30mm MK239 TP-T, HEI-T cartridges are to be procured to Performance Specifications which are classified as Distribution Statement "D".  The 30mm PGU-13B/B Remanufactured HEI, 30mm PGU-13D/B HEI, 30mm PGU-15A/B TP, LW30mm M788 TP, and the LW 30mm M789 HEDP cartridges are to be procured to Technical Data Packages (TDPs) which are classified as Distribution Statement "D".  Distribution Statement "D" means distribution is authorized to the Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. DoD contractors only (Critical Technology).   These TDPs/Performance Specifications contain technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, (Title 22, U.S.C., Section 2751 et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C., app 2401, et seq. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of the TDPs/Performance Specifications.  TDPs/Performance Specifications will not be provided at this time.<BR><BR>Planned Acquisition:<BR>The Government is seeking interested sources to fulfill FY13-17 requirements.  It is contemplated that two awards may be made for these requirements.  <BR><BR>Submission Information:<BR>Interested U.S./Canadian firms who feel they are capable of manufacturing the above cartridges are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government: 1) A brief summary of their companies' capabilities, facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience, 2) Their monthly production capacities with assumptions about number of shifts and any other production factors that may affect their monthly capacities, and 3) The advantages of combining production of all of the above listed cartridges into a single procurement.

<p>Patents End to End (PE2E) is the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office's (USPTO) project to deliver a next-generation IT infrastructure supporting Patents business operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This project will replace the nearly four dozen aging legacy systems used today with a single system that unifies electronic processing over the entire patent application lifecycle (hence "end-to-end").<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The PE2E system will serve the needs of not only internal users such as patent examiners and supervisors, but also external customers including patent applicants, patent attorneys, patent researchers, and the general public.</p>
<p>Prior art references are paramount in the prosecution of a patent application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The examiner and the applicant/inventor cite references to support the disclosure and to determine the patentability of the invention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently, the USPTO records and saves a copy of the prior art documents for each application even though the document might already reside in many other applications in the USPTO system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This inefficiency is prevalent with Non-Patent Literature and Foreign Patent References.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, currently the USPTO does not provide examiners with bibliographic metadata for prior art other than patents, so the examiner has to enter that metadata even if the document has been used many times in previous office actions.</p>
<p>The new Patents End to End system will contain an internal database of bibliographic reference metadata to be used both by examiners citing art and by applicants submitting art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(It will also contain a full text database of relevant art, but that is not the subject of this RFI).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>This RFI seeks to obtain information from interested parties, including the vendor community, about potential opportunities to acquire bibliographic metadata reference information in bulk and preferably with minimal cost. The USPTO is seeking comments on the identified problem and solutions that will make the data available to the office, preferably free of charge. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The USPTO is also seeking comments about formats for this data.</p>
<p>This RFI seeks information about the availability of bibliographic metadata.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of this RFI, the term bibliographic metadata refers to the citation to the item, if applicable, including: title, author(s), publication, date, volume, number, pages, Document Object Identifiers (DOI), etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As secondary information, if indexing or other kinds of value-added metadata are available free of charge, that information is welcome.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of Technology Innovation and Acquisition (OTIA) will be hosting an Industry Day for vendors interested in learning about near term acquisitions that will support the Department&rsquo;s new strategy for security technology along the Southwest border. The conference will be held Thursday, February 17, 2011 at the Phoenix Convention Center, Phoenix, AZ, from 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. in the West Ballroom Room 301A. The sign-in process will begin at 7:45 a.m.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Attendance is limited to three individuals per company.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This effort contributes towards fulfillment of the following CBP objective:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; margin-left: .25in; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><em><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Establish and maintain effective control of air, land, and maritime borders through the use of the appropriate mix of infrastructure, technology, and personnel.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">In 2010 Secretary of Homeland Security Napolitano directed a Department-wide assessment of the SBI<em>net</em> program that incorporated an independent, quantitative, science-based &ldquo;Analysis of Alternatives&rdquo; to determine if SBI<em>net </em>was the most efficient, effective and economical border security technology strategy available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><span style="color: #333333;">Following the completion of that assessment, which showed that there is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution to meet our border technology needs, </span>Secretary Napolitano decided to <span style="color: #333333;">end SBI<em>net</em> as originally conceived and to embark on a new strategy for security technology along the Southwest border.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 11.25pt; background: white;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #333333;">The new strategy, which will utilize existing, proven technology, is tailored to the unique needs of each border region, and will provide faster deployment of technology, better coverage, and a more effective balance between cost and capability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">In order to support the new strategy, CBP is seeking technology solutions that detect, track, identify, and classify illegal incursions to provide Border Patrol agents with improved situational awareness between the Ports of Entry (POEs). The Government&nbsp;is looking for&nbsp;complete, fully integrated, and proven commercial-off-the-shelf/government-off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) solutions. &nbsp;The Government is not interested in solutions that require measurable developmental effort to integrate COTS/GOTS subsystems.&nbsp; The Government intends to use fixed price contracting strategies for all procurements related to the border security technology solutions.&nbsp; The Government will also have a strong preference for open architecture solutions.&nbsp; In this context, &ldquo;open architecture&rdquo; means an inherent ability to &ldquo;plug-and-play&rdquo; (consistent with well-defined interface descriptions)&mdash;including switch-out of hardware and software components from other suppliers&mdash;without any additional integration costs or any additional involvement from the original equipment manufacturer(s).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There is no intent to develop any items or systems under the program. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The <span>new border technology strategy has been divided into three technology solution areas and this Industry Day will center on these three technology solution areas provided as follows:</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Agent- Centric Solutions</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Between the POEs, patrolling Border Patrol agents are one of the primary resources for detecting, identifying, and classifying Items of Interest (IoI).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>As such, additional agent-portable technology is needed to provide agents with a larger field of view and additional detection, tracking, identification and classification capability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Such technology assets need to be rugged and easily portable. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Mobile Sensor Solutions</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">CBP requires sensors that are transportable and can be set up and broken down easily by individual Border Patrol agents. These sensors may be deployed to remote and rugged areas and may be left in the field for varying durations based on traffic patterns. These assets need to be capable of being moved easily as the threat shifts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Mobile assets will provide enhanced detection, tracking, identification, and classification capability. Mobile assets may be overtly (e.g., installed on vehicles) or covertly deployed (e.g., buried underground or camouflaged). Agents may deploy these sensors and operate them remotely, or remain on site. Agents will communicate their findings with one another and their respective stations in order to affect a response.<br />&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Fixed Sensor Solutions</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">CBP requires sensors to be deployed at fixed sites that provide a persistent detect, track, identify, and classify capability with an extended field of view. Automation of these capabilities is desired. Border Patrol agents desire the ability to remotely identify whether an IoI is a human, animal, conveyance or other, and the ability to discern the level of threat associated with an IoI. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The ability of the agents to respond can be enhanced by including technology that covertly guides agents to the location of IoIs. Additionally, incorporating a detection capability that does not rely on line-of-sight visibility enables CBP to cover gaps and better operate in varying terrain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is envisioned that&nbsp;data from some or all of the fixed sites may be transmitted to a&nbsp;centrally located&nbsp;Common Operating Picture&nbsp;(COP), which fuses the various sensor&nbsp;data and provides a complete situational awareness picture over a large area.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any proposed COP must be fully developed and operational, must be completely integrated with all of the other systems offered by a proposer, must have demonstrated maturity, should reinforce open architecture standards, and&nbsp;should allow for "plug-and-play" of various sensors.&nbsp; The Government does not intend to procure a COP separately from the hardware or sensors. &nbsp;The Government expects to procure an integrated, fully-operational, turn-key capability including all associated hardware and software, as a non-developmental item.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal; tab-stops: 81.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The conference will address all three categories of capability needs presented above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Government may address any of the categories in more detail as an initial focus area based on the Government&rsquo;s immediate needs at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Participants interested in attending the conference must pre-register no later than 14 February 2011, by emailing the attached form to <a href="mailto:Jeffrey.Henkel@cbp.dhs.gov"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Jeffrey.Henkel@cbp.dhs.gov</span></a>. If space permits, CBP will allow attendees to register at the event, however, preference will be given to those who have pre-registered.

<DESC>Special Notice: The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) is awarding a Purchase Order for the purchase of 25 each Calibration Kit, Visibility, to Belfort Instrument Co. Sole Source Justification: The Government knows of only one source, Belfort Instrument Co. The Calibration Kit is specifically manufactured by Belfort Instrument Co. for the National Weather Service (NWS) Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) program. The ASOS Visibility Sensor was tested and selected at considerable Government's expense to be the baseline Visibility Sensor approved for the ASOS. Accurate field calibration checks performed using the Calibration Kit, Visibility Sensor, Belfort Instrument P/N 32339 is critical in ensuring the sensor reports accurate data. Any redesign and remanufacturing costs could not be recovered by using competitive processes. The Government does not have the design rights of the manufacturer drawings for this part. Market Research: The Government conducted a market research and found there are no other calibration kits that can be compared to the calibration kits manufactured by Belfort Instrument. If there were other calibration kits they could not be used without extensive testing. The Government could not recover the cost of testing if they had to compete for a replacement calibration kit. Belfort Instrument is the only known company that can provide a calibration kit using P/N 32339 that meets the Government's requirements. A sources sought was posted on FedBizOpps under NWWA12001150627KLC on January 4, 2011 for a 10-day posting and no responses were received.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<BR><BR>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,<BR><BR>(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and <BR><BR>(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<BR><BR>(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<BR><BR>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<BR><BR>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<BR><BR>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(ii) Examples. <BR><BR>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<BR><BR>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<BR><BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<BR><BR>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<BR><BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)<BR><BR>(1) Listed End Product<BR>	Listed End Product	 	Listed Countries of Origin:<BR> 		 	<BR> 		 	<BR> 		 	<BR><BR>(2) Certification.

b.	All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information.

If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
e.	If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
(8)	Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9)	Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10)	Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11)	Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected
individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
(1)	Notification;
(2)	One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(3)	Data breach analysis;

(5)	One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and

CONTRACTOR RULES OF BEHAVIOR
This User Agreement contains rights and authorizations regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This User Agreement covers my access to all VA data whether electronic or hard copy ("Data"), VA information systems and resources ("Systems"), and VA sites ("Sites"). This User Agreement incorporates Rules of Behavior for using VA, and other information systems and resources under the contract.
1. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ALL ACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES UNDER THE CONTRACT:
a.	I understand and agree that I have no reasonable expectation of privacy in accessing or using any VA, or other Federal Government information systems.
b.	I consent to reviews and actions by the Office of Information & Technology (OI&T) staff designated and authorized by the VA Chief Information Officer (CIO) and to the VA OIG regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA. These actions may include monitoring, recording, copying, inspecting, restricting access, blocking, tracking, and disclosing to all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel as directed by the VA CIO without my prior consent or notification.
c.	I consent to reviews and actions by authorized VA systems administrators and Information Security Officers solely for protection of the VA infrastructure, including, but not limited to monitoring, recording, auditing, inspecting, investigating, restricting access, blocking, tracking, disclosing to authorized personnel, or any other authorized actions by all authorized OI&T, VA, and law enforcement personnel.
d.	I understand and accept that unauthorized attempts or acts to access, upload, change, or delete information on Federal Government systems; modify Federal government systems; deny access to Federal government systems; accrue resources for unauthorized use on Federal government systems; or otherwise misuse Federal government systems or resources are prohibited.
f.	I understand that such unauthorized attempts or acts are subject to action that may result in criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. This includes penalties for violations of Federal laws including, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1030 (fraud and related activity in connection with computers) and 18 U.S.C. 2701 (unlawful access to stored communications).I agree that OI&T staff, in the course of obtaining access to information or systems on my behalf for performance under the contract, may provide information about me including, but not limited to, appropriate unique personal identifiers such as date of birth and social security number to other system administrators, Information Security Officers (ISOs), or other authorized staff without further notifying me or obtaining additional written or verbal permission from me.
g.	I understand I must comply with VAs security and data privacy directives and handbooks. I understand that copies of those directives and handbooks can be obtained from the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). If the contractor believes the policies and guidance provided by the COTR is a material unilateral change to the contract, the contractor must elevate such concerns to the Contracting Officer for resolution.
h.	I will report suspected or identified information security/privacy incidents to the COTR and to the local ISO or Privacy Officer as appropriate.
2. GENERAL RULES OF BEHAVIOR
a.	Rules of Behavior are part of a comprehensive program to provide complete information security. These rules establish standards of behavior in recognition of the fact that knowledgeable users are the foundation of a successful security program. Users must understand that taking personal responsibility for the security of their computer and the information it contains is an essential part of their job.
b.	The following rules apply to all VA contractors. I agree to:
(1)	Follow established procedures for requesting, accessing, and closing user accounts and access. I will not request or obtain access beyond what is normally granted to users or by what is outlined in the contract.
(2)	Use only systems, software, databases, and data which I am authorized to use, including any copyright restrictions.
(3)	I will not use other equipment (OE) (non-contractor owned) for the storage, transfer, or processing of VA sensitive information without a VA CIO approved waiver, unless it has been reviewed and approved by local management and is included in the language of the contract. If authorized to use OE IT equipment, I must ensure that the system meets all applicable 6500 Handbook requirements for OE.
(4)	Not use my position of trust and access rights to exploit system controls or access information for any reason other than in the performance of the contract.
(5)	Not attempt to override or disable security, technical, or management controls unless expressly permitted to do so as an explicit requirement under the contract or at the direction of the COTR or ISO. If I am allowed or required to have a local administrator account on a government-owned computer, that local administrative account does not confer me unrestricted access or use, nor the authority to bypass security or other controls except as expressly permitted by the VA CIO or CIO's designee.
(6)	Contractors use of systems, information, or sites is strictly limited to fulfill the terms of the contract. I understand no personal use is authorized. I will only use other Federal government information systems as expressly authorized by the terms of those systems. I accept that the restrictions under ethics regulations and criminal law still apply.
(7)	Grant access to systems and information only to those who have an official need to know.
(8)	Protect passwords from access by other individuals.
(9)	Create and change passwords in accordance with VA Handbook 6500 on systems and any devices protecting VA information as well as the rules of behavior and security settings for the particular system in question.

I will only use encryption that is FIPS 140-2 validated to safeguard VA sensitive information, both safeguarding VA sensitive information in storage and in transit regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA.
(11)	Follow VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization to protect VA information. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR's orders.
(12)	Ensure that the COTR has previously approved VA information for public dissemination, including e-mail communications outside of the VA as appropriate. I will not make any unauthorized disclosure of any VA sensitive information through the use of any means of communication including but not limited to e-mail, instant messaging, online chat, and web bulletin boards or logs.
(13)	Not host, set up, administer, or run an Internet server related to my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA unless explicitly authorized under the contract or in writing by the COTR.
(14)	Protect government property from theft, destruction, or misuse. I will follow VA directives and handbooks on handling Federal government IT equipment, information, and systems. I will not take VA sensitive information from the workplace without authorization from the COTR.
(15)	Only use anti-virus software, antispyware, and firewall/intrusion detection software authorized by VA. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR's orders regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA.
(16)	Not disable or degrade the standard anti-virus software, antispyware, and/or firewall/intrusion detection software on the computer I use to access and use information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA. I will report anti-virus, antispyware, firewall or intrusion detection software errors, or significant alert messages to the COTR.
(17)	Understand that restoration of service of any VA system is a concern of all users of the system.
(18)	Complete required information security and privacy training, and complete required training for the particular systems to which I require access.
3. ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR USE OF NON- VA INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES

b.	Remote access to non-public VA information technology resources is prohibited from publicly-available IT computers, such as remotely connecting to the internal VA network from computers in a public library.
c.	I will not have both a VA network line and any kind of non-VA network line including a wireless network card, modem with phone line, or other network device physically connected to my computer at the same time, unless the dual connection is explicitly authorized by the COTR.
d.	I understand that I may not obviate or evade my responsibility to adhere to VA security requirements by subcontracting any work under any given contract or agreement with VA, and that any subcontractor(s) I engage shall likewise be bound by the same security requirements and penalties for violating the same.
4. STATEMENT ON LITIGATION

<DESC>The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supplies, state required insurance, incidentals, and transportation necessary to perform snow grooming of snowmobile trails and provide a smooth surface, upon which an average snowmobile user can travel up to a safe speed of 30 MPH on all the trails that are listed within this contract.
<p>The intent of this contract is to provide a safe and smooth surface for snowmobile use and use by other non-motorized winter recreation users (Nordic skiers, snowshoers, snow campers, sled dog racers, etc.). The groomed trail shall be flat, smooth, free of moguls and bumps, and clear of hazards. Snow set up time should be planned so the set up groomed trail is a compacted, durable, groomed surface.</p>
<p>The winter snowmobile season historically has consisted of approximately 20 weeks. Snow conditions the past few years have allowed grooming operations to begin as early as late November or not until late December. Grooming may not be possible all winter long due to lack of snow or other weather conditions. Grooming operations may end as early as mid-March or continue into late April.</p>

Brand Name Justification

The EMC Networker product is certified to work with the EMC SAN and NAS, and VMware which we are using in production. EMC Network supports the VMware backup API which  improves backup performance and reduces performance impact of VM servers while being backed up.
 This backup solution is being used in a production capacity and therefore required for the Test and Development environment to effectively test performance, reliability, and security of software/hardware updates, patches, and configuration changes before deploying to production. The Test and Development backup system must match production for tape format compatibility.  The production and test environments are currently utilizing HP blades for other services.  Implementing like systems provides interoperability between systems and yields a reduced support cost in providing 'like' hardware for other production purposes.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only publication.  Solicitation number M6700111Q0073 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-49 24 Jan 2011.   This procurement is set aside 100% for SMALL BUSINESS.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 325188 and the small business size standard is 1000.   This requirement is being procured utilizing FAR Part 13 procedures.

This procurement is for the purchase of Sweet Water, to be used in the treatment of wastewater.
   This is a BRAND NAME ONLY procurement.   Quotes for other than the brand name item will not be considered.
 
The justification for Brand Name Only is due to the volatility enhancement for wastewater treatment of Class A EQ bio-solids for land application  required for compliance with the State of NC Land Application Permit.  Sweet Water is used in the Autothermal Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion (ATAD) Reactors as a carbon source for the thermophilic microbes to break down and consume the organics in the reactors which produce heat.  The reactors have to maintain 55 deg. Celsius for at least 24 hours to produce Class A EQ biosolids which can be land applied.  Without the Sweet Water, the reactors will not reach temperature and not produce the Class A biosolids.
  If that occurs, Class B biosolids are produced, which cannot be land applied, and the customer has no means to dispose of the solids produced.
Due to an unforeseen need for additional Sweet Water to process the bio-solids, current stock has been depleted.

Evaluation and Basis for Award:

Award will be made to the lowest-priced technically acceptable quote.  The Government intends to make a single firm-fixed price award to satisfy the requirement.

Pricing Quote Submission:

1.  The Government will conduct the price evaluation required by FAR 13.	
      a. The Contractors submitted price quote must reflect the unit price and extended/overall amount.
      b. All submitted pricing must be actual face-value pricing, having already accounted for any discounts offered and extended to the Government.
  All quotes submitted shall be the Contractors best pricing.
 
Delivery: 

1.  The Government requires delivery of contracted items within 10 days After Receipt of Order (ARO).  The Government prefers items to be shipped F.O.B. Destination.  Items will be shipped to:

Water Treatment Plant
Bldg FC440
Camp Lejeune, NC  28542

Wide Area Work Flow:  

1.  As a condition of receipt of this contract, the Contractor agrees to implement the Department of Defense (DoD) web-based software application titled Wide Area Work Flow  Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA).  This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents electronically.  WAWF-RA allows for complete visibility throughout the acceptance and payment process.

<p>CRITICAL INFORMATION REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION: all offerors should read the solicitation, including all attachments, posted in Fed Biz Opps. The requirements for the services and for submitting responses are detailed in the posting.

<p>1. Offerors shall submit an original and one (1) copy of their response documents.<br />2. Attachment A.1 has been amended to include three (3) new CLINs. Offeror must use this form to submit its Price/Cost Schedule.<br />3. A new attachment has been added to the solicitation. Attachment B.5 lists the location of the existing temporary housing units that could be replaced. It also indicates whether the existing units have steps, ramps and ADA special needs.</p>

<p>23. Is it fed land or private?<br />ANSWER: See Attachment B.5.</p>

Brand Name Justification

The EMC Networker product is certified to work with the EMC SAN and NAS, and VMware which we are using in production. EMC Network supports the VMware backup API which  improves backup performance and reduces performance impact of VM servers while being backed up.
 This backup solution is being used in a production capacity and therefore required for the Test and Development environment to effectively test performance, reliability, and security of software/hardware updates, patches, and configuration changes before deploying to production. The Test and Development backup system must match production for tape format compatibility.  The production and test environments are currently utilizing HP blades for other services.  Implementing like systems provides interoperability between systems and yields a reduced support cost in providing 'like' hardware for other production purposes.

<RESPDATE>020311
<ARCHDATE>02182011
<CONTACT>Kathy Snell, 817-222-4657

<a href="mailto:kathy.snell@faa.gov">kathy.snell@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>**This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability of ALL potential business sources (Small and Large).**   The Federal Aviation Administration in the Central Service Area is conducting market research to determine potential sources having the skills, capabilities, experience and bonding necessary to perform the described work.  No award will be made from this Sources Sought.  No solicitation, specifications or drawings are available, therefore, do request a copy of a solicitation.  All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition.
**The FAA is seeking to gain knowledge of the availability of all business sources (Small and Large) to perform the roofing replacements for the following type of projects:**    The Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Range (VOR) facility is a ground-based electronic system that provides azimuth information for both low & high altitude flight routes as well as airport approaches and is a critical component within the National Airspace System. The roofs of these facilities provide the interior equipment both a protective barrier from the elements as well as an electrically reflective surface required for the equipment to operate. Because the VOR must be totally removed from service for the duration of the roof replacement; work should be planned, scheduled, and completed in a manner so as to minimize downtime.
VOR roofs consist of a circular roof deck and a centered fiberglass cone antenna shelter which will be required to be removed prior to roofing. The cone is secured to the roof deck. VOR's utilize a system of monitor antennas for operation which are placed around the roof perimeter. Conventional VOR's have 16 monitor antennas which typically attach to the vertical perimeter edge of the roof and can be easily removed for convenience/protection during the roof work. Doppler VOR's have 50 side band/monitor antennas that must remain in place during roof work and will require welding patches/flashing around the base of each antenna.
The types of roofing material to be provided will be, but not limited to PVC Single-ply roofing systems with a 20 year full systems warranty, Firestone Rubber Gard Platinum single ply membrane systems with a minimum of 30 year full systems warranty, modified bitumen membrane roof system (Firestone, Owen Corning, Siplast, Tamko, TREMCO, DERBIGUM, Mule Hide) with a roof manufacturer's warranty.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238160, Roofing Contractors.  Small business size standard is $14.0M. **The Offeror will perform at least 15% of the work with their own forces.**
The FAA is anticipating award of one or several Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for this effort. The aggregate not to exceed amount for the IDIQ contracts for a specified area will be approximately $8.5M.  The task orders will range approximately between $30,000 to $60,000. Based on the Sources Sought Notice responses a determination will be made on how the effort will be divided throughout the Central Service area in one, two, or three areas and number of contracts to be awarded and competed amongst contract holders.  The Central Service Area is as follows:  Great Lakes Region (North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio).  Central Region (Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri). Southwest Region (New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana).
Capabilities Statement:  The following requests are designed to inform the FAA of any prospective contractors project execution capabilities.  Please provide your response to the following.  The submission is limited to 5 pages.
1. Offerors name, address, point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, DUNs Number.
2.  Offerors interested in bidding on the solicitation will need to identify the regions that you would be willing to perform this work (Great Lakes Region, Central Region, Southwest Region) or identify the states that you would be willing to perform in.
**3.  Offerors business size.**
4.  Offerors bonding and insurance capability.
5.  Offerors capability to perform a contract of this magnitude and complexity and comparable work performed within the last 5 years in the location area of interest, brief description of the project, customer name, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction, and dollar value of the project.  Provide at least 3 examples identifying the types of materials/installation performed.
The capabilities statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a Request for Proposal or an Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the FAA to an acquisition approach, but rather short statements regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing or developed expertise and experience in relation to these types of projects.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with Capabilities statement.  Submission of capabilities statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the FAA in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the FAA nor will the FAA pay for information solicited. 
All interested contractors should notify this office by email no later than February 3, 2011.

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components.</p>
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>
