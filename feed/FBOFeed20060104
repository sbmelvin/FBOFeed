<SUBJECT>99--Development of a TDWR Target Simulation System

<RESPDATE>022206
<ARCHDATE>03242006
<CONTACT>Phyllis Townsley, 405-954-7816
<DESC>The FAA has a requirement for a Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) Target Simulation System.  The intent of this market survey is to initiate industry involvement, develop and refine the procurement strategy, obtain price information, determine whether commercial items exist, determine the level of competition, identify market practices, and obtain comments on requirements. TDWR Background: The TDWR is a C-Band weather radar that puts runway specific weather products on an air traffic controller's situation displays, such as: windshear alerts, microburst alerts, gust fronts and heavy precipitation.  It is a 3-D radar with 0.5 degree beam width that processes range cells (range gates) of 150 meters.  Unlike point target detection, the TDWR must be optimized for weather targets so the receiver, signal processor and radar computer always generate scientifically reproducible weather products. Some TDWR Operating Parameters:  1.	Frequency: C-Band 5600 MHz to 5650 MHz  2.	Pulse modulated signal with a pulse width of 1 microsecond and rise/fall time 110-200 nanoseconds.  3.	PRF of 325 Hz to 2000 Hz that varies in a 6 minute volume scan of the radar.  4.	The radar return waveform has a lower level typically -120 dBm.  5.	The radar completes one volume scan in 6 minutes.  We would like to save 5-6 volume scans of waveform data.  6.	There are 23 "tilts" (i.e. Twenty three 360-degree tilts) during a volume scan. Each tilt varies in time, but the fastest is 12 seconds and all .  7.	Each tilt varies in time, but all are completed in one 6 minute volume scan.  8.	The noise figure of the radar return waveform is reduced by approximately 70 dB using a band pass filter outside the 10 MHz window. TDWR Receiver Specifications: 1.	Frequency Range:  5600 MHz to 5650 MHz (However, only a single frequency is used, receiver input is filtered to only accept 5 MHz around this single frequency for a 10MHz pass band.) 2.	Bandwidth:  910 kHz at 3 dB 3.	C-Band LO:  5630 MHz to 5680 MHz 4.	IF:  30 MHz 5.	System Clock:  10 MHz 6.	Image Rejection:  >50 dB at downconverter input 7.	Dynamic Range:  127.5 dB (total) 101.5 dB (instantaneous) 8.	Sensitivity Time Control:  26 dB 9.	Automatic Gain Control:  42 dB 10.	Receiver Sensitivity:  -110.8 dBm 11.	Pulse Width:  1.0 us +/- 0.1 us 12.	Pulse Repetition Frequency:  326.2 Hz to 1930.5 Hz 13.	Range Sample:  150 m 14.	Azimuth Sample:  1 deg 15.	Stability:  -60.7 dBc System Requirements: There is a need to develop a TDWR target simulation system that can capture the radar return waveform from a 10 dB directional coupler before the signal enters the receiver downconverter and to save the waveform on a hard drive.   The length of time to capture is 25-30 minutes and the FAA would like to manipulate the waveform using various software tools.  While capturing the waveform, there is a need to trigger the capturing tool for external analog interrupts and place markers in time for them. Once the waveform data has been saved, the FAA would like to playback the waveform (pump the RF signal) through the radar receiver that is cued by the recorded interrupt markers and by matching external analog interrupts.  This means the waveform will be played back when it receives an external cue that matches the recorded marker.  This will enable the FAA to truth test our radar receiver and signal processor to determine the changes made to it.  The goal is to get repeatable targets on the radar situation display with the saved waveforms.   The return waveform has a 10 MHz span at C-Band frequency and it would be ideal to save this waveform in a 32-bit word format. There are two analog interrupts that must be captured and played back. The first is the Antenna Control Pulse (ACP).  There is 1 ACP per 0.05 degrees of antenna motion. This results in 7200 ACPs per tilt. The other analog interrupt is the Antenna Reference Pulse (ARP) indicating the end of a tilt. Therefore, there are 23 ARPs in a volume scan.  Total analog interrupts needed in one 6-minute volume scan: 165,600 + 23 = 165,623. Attached for reference are three drawings that contain: TDWR Receiver Exciter (REX) block diagram, the exciter unit of the REX and receiver portion of the REX.  Interested vendors that may have capabilities to develop a TDWR target simulation system should respond with their proposed documentation (2 copies) to demonstrate their ability to the Contracting Officer.  Responses are due March 1, 2006.  The documentation must clearly demonstrate the ability to capture radar return data that is between the frequencies of 5600 MHz and 5650 MHz, and play it back through a radar receiver. If radar data captured is less than 25 minutes, then the playback system should be able to "stitch" together pieces of data that are at least 5 minutes of recording.  Questions may be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer.  Facsimile responses are not permitted.   The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this announcement.  Any information received as a result of this market survey will not be for use outside the Government but solely for the purpose of determining whether sources exist for this requirement.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.  This market survey shall not be construed as a request for proposal or an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Responders to this market survey may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.

A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSCPOL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].

* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
	TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                  ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to schedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

(h)	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSCPOL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                     ].

* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
	TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                  ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to schedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

(h)	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS for DTFH71-06-R-00003

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD), anticipates awarding a professional services contract to perform extensive data processing and analysis of pavement surface condition data for an estimated 5,400 paved route miles collected within 86 parks for the National Park Service (NPS), generate 86 NPS reports, and provide full functionality viewing software customized to allow viewing of synchronized digital video images along with processed data. On an established schedule, the Federal Highway Administration Road Inventory Program (RIP) will collect roadway data using an automated data collection vehicle equipped with digital cameras for recording downward, forward ahead, and right-of-way images.  Under this project, the Contractor will perform detailed data analysis of downward pavement images to determine distress type, severity, and quantities; calculate distress indices, roughness condition indices, surface condition ratings, and pavement condition ratings; measure roadway width using forward-view images; identify, locate and categorize specific roadway and sign features using forward-view images; and populate park databases with processed data.  In conjunction with the data processing and analysis, the Contractor will create electronic Cycle 4 RIP reports for each of the 86 parks.  In addition, the Contractor will develop and provide software that will allow viewing of synchronized digital video images along with processed data.  The software program must be able to accept queries to the database and display charts and grids.  It is anticipated that work will commence in Spring 2006 and the Cycle 4 contract work will be performed over a three-year period, with its completion in Spring 2009.  The value of this contract is estimated between $500,000.00 to $1,000,000.00.

IMPORTANT PAYMENT REQUIREMENT
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart part 4.1102, prospective contractors shall be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.  Also FAR clause 52.232-33 requires CCR registration for payment.  CCR registration is available on line at the following Internet web address: www.ccr.gov.

IMPORTANT SUBCONTRACTING PLANS REQUIREMENT

Required from all “other than Small business” when requirement is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) [FAR 19.702].  Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer Technical Representative, and Small Business Specialist are responsible for approving a reasonable and realistic plan. [FAR 19.705-4] [TAM 1219.201(e)(6)]. Legislated subcontracting goals: 19% Small Disadvantaged Business, 5% Small Women-owned Business Concern, 3% Small Disadvantaged Veteran-owned Small Business. Copy of each subcontracting plan (or contractor statement that no subcontracts are to be awarded) must be provided to Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization prior to close of negotiations, (or notice to proceed with IFB) [TAM 1219.705-5 and -6]. 

Architect-Engineering (A/E) procedures will be used to select firms, which must be capable of providing the required design and engineering services either independently or in conjunction with subcontractors.  To be eligible for contract award a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), register via the Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov

Pre-selection and selection will be based on the following criteria:

The Government will award to the lowest priced/technically acceptable responsible offeror. In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Contracting Officer intends to evaluate only the three lowest-priced proposals for technical acceptability. Other proposals will not be evaluated for technical acceptability unless one or more of the three lowest-priced proposals is determined technically unacceptable. In that event, the Contracting Officer will evaluate the fourth lowest-priced proposal, and so on until the three lowest-priced, technically acceptable proposals have been evaluated.

Award will be made to the lowest-priced, technically acceptable offeror. If three or fewer proposals are received in response to this solicitation, all will be evaluated for technical acceptability. Note: Competing technical proposals are evaluated against the solicitation requirements; they are not compared with each other. Each of the technical factors described below will be rated on a pass/fail basis.  The sum of the weight values assigned to each passing factor/sub-factor/sub-factor component must total greater than or equal to 80 percent for an offeror's proposal to receive further consideration.  Failure to receive a total passing score of 80 percent may result in rejection of an offeror's proposal notwithstanding passing scores for one or more technical factors/sub-factors/sub-factor components unless the offeror is determined to be in the competitive range for the purpose of conducting negotiations on the proposal.  Technical acceptability will be determined by evaluating each responsive proposal and comparing the results of that evaluation against the technical requirements specified in this solicitation.  Proposals that satisfy the technical requirements of the solicitation, in light of the evaluation criteria, will be determined technically acceptable.

As part of its proposal, the offeror must demonstrate its ability to successfully perform the contract work described in the RFP by processing a sample data set and submitting a Technical Acceptability Evaluation Package to the FHWA for review, evaluation and determination of technical acceptability.  From FHWA collected data in Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO), a single route, ROMO Route 0011 estimated to be 5.26 miles in length with 4 associated parking areas, constitutes the sample data set to process and include in the Technical Acceptability Evaluation Package.

The selection criteria will include the following factors.   All references to tables and appendices in the factors will be found in the RFP. 

FACTOR 1: DATA PROCESSING

The Government will test and evaluate each offeror’s ability to accurately and successfully process the ROMO Route 0011 sample data set to determine technical acceptability for data processing.  In order to “pass” the data processing requirement, the offeror must satisfy the criteria set forth in Table 1, Evaluation Factors by (1) performing detailed data analysis of downward pavement images to determine distress type, severity, and quantities, (2) calculating distress indices, roughness condition indices, surface condition ratings, and pavement condition ratings, (3) measuring roadway width using forward-view images, (4) identifying, locating and categorizing specific roadway and sign features using forward-view images, and (5) populating the ROMO Route 0011 database with processed data.  The Government will test and evaluate the offeror’s processed ROMO Route 0011 data and will determine pass or fail for each sub-factor and sub-factor component.  

FACTOR 2: REPORT CREATION

The Government will review and evaluate each offeror’s ability to accurately create a ROMO Route 0011 report that will be representative of a complete Park report created during Cycle 4 production.  In order to “pass” the report creation requirement, the offeror must demonstrate that it is capable of producing a report in resemblance with the DETO example, and satisfy the criteria set forth in Table 1, Evaluation Factors.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s ROMO Route 0011 report and determine pass or fail for this factor.

FACTOR 3: VIEWING SOFTWARE WORK PLAN

The Government will review and evaluate each offeror’s submission under this factor to confirm that all viewing software elements as described in Appendix J: Viewing Software Specifications of this solicitation are addressed.  The offeror’s work plan must demonstrate that it is capable of developing and providing software that will allow viewing of synchronized digital video images along with processed data and will satisfy the criteria presented in Appendix J: Viewing Software Specifications and the criteria set forth in Table 1, Evaluation Factors.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s Viewing Software Work Plan and determine pass or fail for this factor.

FACTOR 4: EXPERIENCE AND PAST PERFORMANCE

The Government will review and evaluate information about each offeror's experience and past performance and will rate offerors based on their documented experience and past performance as it compares to the work described in this solicitation and the criteria set forth in Table 1, Evaluation Factors.  Note that evidence of direct experience of the offeror, any joint venture partners or any offerors related by some form of ownership agreement, will be considered in the evaluation.

The Government will evaluate all information pertaining to offeror experience submitted with the proposal, and will rate the offeror as pass or fail on this factor.  In order to “pass” the experience requirement, the offeror will provide evidence showing the offeror has performed technically the same or similar work (data processing and analysis for automated data collection, generation of reports, and development of full-functionality image viewer software) within the last five years.  To satisfy this requirement, at a minimum, offerors shall submit a list of three (3) contracts awarded to the offeror for technically and geographically similar work of approximately the same dollar magnitude (or greater), and the name and address of the office or firm for which the work was performed.

Although this solicitation is open to all firms, the following is provided for minority, women, and disadvantaged business enterprises only: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), has a program to assist minority, women-owned, and disadvantaged business enterprises to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts. Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing. The maximum line of credit is $750,000. For further information and applicable forms concerning the STLP, please call the OSDBU at (800) 532-1169.

Interested firms having the capabilities for this work are invited to submit Part I of the SF 330 for the prime and/or joint venture firm, and Part II of the SF 330 for each member of the proposed team or subcontractors, by addressing a transmittal letter to the office shown. Joint Ventures must also submit a copy of the Joint Venture Agreement. The SF 330 should be completed per the instructions on the form and may be expanded, if necessary, to address the selection criteria fully.  

Submittals are due February 28, 2006 at 3:00 p.m. local time; send six (6) copies of the submittals and six (6) copies of the sample data set to:

<DESC>Subject: Contract Field Team Maintenance
Proposed Solicitation Number: FA8104-06-R-0026
Opening/Closing Date:  We anticipate issuing a draft RFP on approximately 27 Mar 2006, followed by a Pre-solicitation Conference on approximately 12 Apr 2006, followed by the issuance of the formal RFP on approximately 01 Jun 2006.
Contact Point: Brandi Priddy, Contracting Officer, Phone 405-739-4400 e-mail Brandi.Priddy@tinker.af.mil or Jeff Frederick, Contracting Officer, Phone 405-739-4297 e-mail Jeffrey.Frederick@tinker.af.mil
Description: Provide Contractor Field Team Services to support the United States Air Force and other DoD and Government agencies.  Contract Field Teams are a mobile work force used to supplement organic and contractor fixed facilities.  These teams accomplish modification/maintenance/repair on weapons systems and support equipment at operational government installations both within the Continental United States and overseas.  The work is accomplished on various Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine weapon systems and support equipment.  The solicitation contemplates the award of between four and seven contracts with time and materials contract line items.  However, the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reserves the right to award more or less, if it is in the Government’s best interest, considering the Government’s expected volume of work over the period of the task order contracts, availability of funding, the need to sustain adequate competition, and the availability of quality proposals, following completion of proposal evaluations.  Any contracts resulting from this solicitation shall be evaluated using source selection procedures set forth in AFFARs 5315.3.  The estimated date of contract award is 22 Dec 2006.  Length of contract is anticipated to be ten years total, with a two-year basic and 4 two-year options.  Each contract will be IDIQ and is anticipated to have a min/max of $5,000/$16.3B over the 10-year period.  A partial small business set-aside is anticipated.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered.  Any synopses, RFPs, amendments, etc. will be provided through the GPE at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Potential contractors must be prepared to comply with a vast variety of requirements not ordinarily experienced, including security, hazardous duty areas, immediate responsiveness to unusual needs, and adhere to demanding schedules.  For more information regarding Contract Field Teams, reference Air Force Material Command Instruction 21-141, 05 Aug 2005.  Dates for issuance of draft RFP, Pre-solicitation Conference, and Contract Award are tentative only.  If changes are made to these dates, updates will be posted at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES A BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  NO REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), SOLICITATION, OR OTHER ANNOUNCMENT WILL BE MADE.  THE U.S. COAST GUARD RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (RDC) WILL NOT ISSUE PAPER COPIES OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  THE "RESPONSE DATE" IDENTIFIED IN THIS NOTICE IS FOR WHITE PAPERS ONLY.  ATTACHMENT (1) IS A COPY OF BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT HSCG32-06-R-R00003.  THIS ATTACHMENT PROVIDES THE BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF THIS REQUIREMENT AS WELL AS INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERS AND DUE DATES FOR WHITE PAPERS AND FORMAL PROPOSALS.   ATTACHMENT (A) IS A SAMPLE STATEMENT OF WORK AND DELIVERABLES LIST TO BE USED FOR GUIDANCE PURPOSES ONLY BY OFFERORS SUBMITTING FORMAL PROPOSALS.

The scope of this BAA includes Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III. Phase I will be fully funded.  Phases II and III will each be options that may or may not be exercised by the Government.

Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III Research:  

Successful research will result in a device/system/capability that provides an approaching air, land, or waterborne (surface or subsurface) person or craft an unambiguous, cross-cultural warning that will distinguish innocent traffic from those intending harm. These warnings or this layered warning system, if ignored, will increase the certainty of (if not clearly demonstrate) hostile intent of that approaching person or craft.  

Phase I is short term – completed by the end of 1Q FY07. More emphasis is anticipated on individual devices and/or new technologies and their potential for improved performance rather than its complete system integration to an asset. However, devices considered and/or eventually implemented will be only as good as the systems/strategies they serve. Thus, due consideration should be given to characterizing the concept of operations and representative threat scenarios being addressed. Phase II is expected to produce a preliminary design. In Phase III, the detailed design should be completed and initial demonstrations performed in operational settings on U.S. Navy/Coast Guard assets to fully demonstrate their efficacy. 

Human behavioral factors and cognition analyses, entailing warning and acknowledgement, will be ingredients of this project, within the context of tactically relevant scenarios.  Additionally, acknowledgement and/or certainty of receipt of the warning are essential attributes of any system that will satisfactorily address this problem. 

Possible areas of investment include the creation of devices based on acoustic, electromagnetic, multi-modal, and projectile-based technologies. Warning technology is not limited to any one of the five senses or a specific combination of senses. Innovative solutions are sought, e.g., from virtual barriers to integrated suites of devices across a varied technology basis. Systems and technologies investigated should be focused on the maritime environment. The research effort should provide the warning capability at ranges of approximately 2,000 yards for surface contacts, 20,000 yards for air contacts, and 500 yards for sub-surface contacts.  Decision support methods and tools, as well as stimuli and response algorithms and human effects, should also be considerations.

<ARCHDATE>02282006
<CONTACT>Mr. William R. Waggoner (703) 4321-4161
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Quantico, VA intends to award a Sole Source, Time and Materials contract with Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) options to Harris Corporation, 2800 Jordan Boulevard, Malabar, FL 32950.  This source possesses unique knowledge and capabilities required to perform this service.  The contract’s Period of Performance includes one base year and four option years extending to August 2011.  The value of the contract is expected to be under $8,000,000. The proposed contract action, for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302, is for dedicated depot support management and sustainment for the Lightweight Multi-band Satellite Terminal (LMST) Block 5 Transit Case Systems, AN/USC-65(V)1 & (V)2, Lightweight High Gain X-Band Antenna (LHGXA), AS-4429, and the Large Aperture Multi-band Antenna (LAMDA), AS-4429C.  This requirement involves both depot level and resident site support services and materials necessary to provide the ongoing depot level engineering support, depot storage and issue, and depot repair and overhaul, including redeployment of overhauled/ upgraded systems for the LMST, AN/USC-65(V), LHGXA, AS-4429, and LAMDA, AS-4429C, and their respective component repairable Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and assemblies.  The scope of work provides for the diagnostics, components, and technical services required for the restoration of defective equipment back to !  factory specified operating condition.  The restored items will be returned to supply system stock or issued for immediate use to support field requisitions.  The services portion of the contract includes support in the areas of technical, engineering, and logistical services.  In addition, the contract provides resident site support through Field Support Representatives (FSRs) for the subject equipment deployed worldwide.  In addition, all depot maintenance, repair, rebuild, overhaul, and redeployment required to correct anomalies is accomplished.  The Government did not acquire a Level III drawing package, to be used for in-depth troubleshooting and engineering analysis of system problems and anomalies.  Furthermore the proprietary nature of much of the technical data precludes the availability of such drawings (i.e., a complete data package) support for the systems for which this contract is intended.  Services will be performed at the contractor's site. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Respondents must provide level of effort and dollar estimates to acquire a full understanding of the design of the equipment.  As part of the written response, a respondent must be able to prove to the Government how depot level and field problems can be identified and corrected without the aid of detailed design drawings.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A written response must include evidence of the respondent’s ability to support the described equipment.  Interested parties with the capability of meeting the proposed requirements are requested to provide an E-mail to the MCSC point of contact, Mr. William R. Waggoner, (william.r.waggoner1@usmc.mil) not later than 1400 (2:00 p.m. EST) expressing interest and outlining their capabilities and qualifications to perform the e!  ffort.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, has a requirement to contract for the development and fabrication of a versatile, safe and environmentally friendly water-impact location identifier to serve the test and evaluation needs of advanced munitions development programs. This project, identified as the Soft Impact Location Capability (SILC), will provide a modular, portable system to support full-envelope testing of advanced ordnance systems using shallow water ocean impact areas in lieu of traditional land-impact ranges. This approach locates ordnance impact areas in modest water depths (12-100 meters) that enable post-test recovery of the projectiles.  System must support remote command and control of the system and data telemetry over distances out to 50 n. miles.  A single contract will be awarded for the delivery of a set of first article components, and then followed by the delivery of the production quantities.  Procurement History:  Using a spiral development process, two contracts were previously awarded under BAA-043338  September of 2004, to develop initial prototypes under the spiral 1 phase.  One contract was awarded to C&M Technology, Inc. of Old Saybrook, CT for $512,142 and the other contract was awarded to METOCEAN Data Systems Ltd. (MARTEC Group) of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada for $512,000.  Both of these contracts resulted in a sea-test demonstration of the respective prototype systems.  Under spiral-2 development, the new acquisition being advertised herein will identify additional enhancements and requirements beyond what has been previously demonstrated by either C&M or METOCEAN.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.

<DESC>Washington Savannah River Company (WSRC) is the Management & Operating Contractor for the United States Department of Energy at the Savannah River Site (SRS), located near Aiken, SC.  WSRC is seeking prospective suppliers interested in providing labor, materials, equipment and services to design, construct, start-up and operate a steam generating facility at the Site’s 700-Area.  The primary purpose of the steam is for HVAC needs; however, it is used intermittently for process requirements.   The projected average steam demand will be approximately 15,000 pounds per hour.  Winter peak demands are anticipated to be approximately 35,000 pounds per hour.   The current operating pressure of the steam system is 325 pounds per square inch gage.  The steam operating pressure can be a minimum of 150 pounds per square inch gage the maximum pressure should not exceed 325 pounds per square inch gage.   The steam will be saturated.  The facility will be located on SRS property.  Suppliers will likely be responsible for funding modifications to existing steam pressure reducing stations, as needed, if a different pressure steam is proposed.  The supplier will be responsible for evaluating existing systems, structures, and components to ensure that they are not adversely affected by the steam conditions being provided by the new steam facility.  Reliability conditions for the system may require 24 hour-per-day on-site surveillance.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) may be initiated in the near future.  Any subsequent subcontract or lease award will be made on a best value basis.  Prospective suppliers are requested to express their interest in writing to Mr. Lawrence Coffey at the following address no later than 1/27/06.

TITLE:   COLLABORATION FOR ISR PLATFORMS

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 06-10-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 by 1 May 06; FY 07 by 1 Aug 06; FY 08 by 1 May 07 and, FY 09 by 1 May 08 and, FY 10 by 1 May 09. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sept 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of increased situational awareness for ISR cross platform collaboration and cross platform cueing.

Today’s intelligence operators and analysts continue to rely on solutions that are largely domain or sensor-type specific.  Additionally, the closed architectures of the various systems make the combination of each system’s capabilities into a single component costly and, in some cases, not possible.  This BAA addresses the need for an open-architected and scalable solution to these issues.  The requirement is for an integrated, operator-focused, multi-intelligence knowledge association system that can ingest data from multiple ISR sensors and intelligence sources and support cross platform cueing, cross platform collaboration, Time Critical/Sensitive Targeting, strike planning, and support to overall battlefield situation awareness monitoring, and reporting and provide Situation Assessment tools that can be adapted to a variety of missions including Area of Interest monitoring and alerting; High Interest Track monitoring and alerting; and enhancing operator understanding through cross referencing known information and databases.

The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, demonstrate and transition system technologies.  This program will employ and exploit existing technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units while developing new capabilities and technologies. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a roadmap of continued spiral development over the five year program. In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complementary activities including, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, data collection and management, and a distributed collaborative engineering environment. 

The developed capabilities may be transitioned to the RC135 fleet to include Rivet Joint and Senior Scout, C2C, National Systems, the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) and other ISR platforms. 

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $1.5M; FY 07 - $7.5M; FY 08 - $5.5M; FY09 - $5.9M; FY10 - $4.5M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $350K to $2.2M per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).   Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

AFRL intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that proposers selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies.  Key performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF).  Proposers desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization’s approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know. 


3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror’s will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

The  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute?s Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center for the National Human Genome Research Institute intends to negotiate an award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health
625 North Wolfe Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, to continue an ongoing collaborator of providing pre-doctoral training in genetic counseling.   The Statement of Work is as follows: Background and Objectives: The Department of Health Behavior and Society in the Bloomberg School of Public Heath at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a shared interest in scientific progress in the field of genetic counseling, as well as in the training of the next generation of outstanding investigators that will advance the field in the interest of national health.  Based on the history of excellence in genetic counseling research at both JHU and the NIH IRP, it is valuable to jointly cooperate in the training of masters? level and doctoral level students in genetic counseling which it is hoped will lead to better collaborative interactions and joint scientific research between the faculty and scientists from these institutions.  Description of Work: Specifically, the NIH IRP will provide, through designated members of its research staff and classroom facilities, didactic instruction, academic support and thesis mentoring of pre-doctoral students enrolled in the Department of Health Behavior and Society?s Genetic Counseling Program at the Bloomberg School of Public Heath at the Johns Hopkins University.  The Johns Hopkins University will provide didactic instruction, academic support and thesis mentoring including the awarding of masters? and doctoral degrees to candidates that have successfully completed the requirement specified by the University and its faculties.  This relationship will also continue to link together two groups of investigators located on geographically separate campuses for the advancement of knowledge and research in the discipline fo genetic counseling.  Period of Performance: January 2006 through December 2008.   Place of Performance:  The department of Health Behavior and Society in the Bloomberg School of Public Heath at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland. The sole source determination is based upon the ongoing collaboration between the Department of Health Behavior and Society in the Bloomberg School of Public Heath at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The JHU is the only University in the proximity of the National Institutes of Health that has an accredited program which offers the unique combination of courses and research facility needed to sustain a Genomic Counseling Program which meets the objectives of this requirement.   An award to any other source for the items would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements, is not applicable to simplified acquisitions.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541990, Size Standard $6 million.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties are requested to review the above requirements, and submit a statement of interest  which includes; a firm fixed price, documentation of similar research conducted and the benefits in obtaining the Government?s objectives;  at least three (3) references documenting successful past performance in meeting the Government?s minimum specifications; and a proposed delivery plan.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) plans to re-compete its Contracted Advisory and Assistance Services II (CAASII) contract to meet its continuing requirement for contracted support on a worldwide basis within the broad range of Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS). This covers, three major categories of A&AS: Management and Professional Support Services; Studies, Analyses, and Evaluations; and Engineering and Technical. All HQ ACC directorates are considered primary using activities for this contract effort; however, other organizations and agencies assigned to support ACC may require similar CAAS services on an as needed basis. The current CAAS II contract provides for A&AS to HQ ACC directorates as well as the 505th Command and Control Wing at Hurlburt Field, Fl. The contract serves as a vehicle to provide broadened technical and analytical tools, support or improve policy development, management, and administration, or improve the operation of systems supporting the mission.  Services are also required during several phases of planning, programming, acquisition, and implementation cycles of various Government systems, and compliments the Government’s technical expertise in accomplishing its’ mission.  All services requested under this contract are non-personal in nature and requested by a Task Order generated by the applicable functional area and Contracting Officer (CO). 
   
The ACC PMS/XR in partnership with ACC CONS is planning an Industry Day Forum for 4 Apr 05.

The Procurement Oversight Advisor position will report directly to the MCC.  The Procurement Oversight Advisor will work closely with the Procurement Supervisor position in the Honduran accountable entity (MCA-Honduras).

<DESC>THIS NOTICE AMENDS THE CLOSING DATE TO FEBRUARY 15, 2006.
USAID/Colombia, Office of Democracy and Governance, anticipates award of a three year contract with options for two-one year extensions for the Judicial Reform and Modernization Program. The  JRMP will support Colombian judiciary initiatives to be more independent, effective and transparent. This new effort will include results areas to broaden, deepen and build on justice sector reform achievements to date, while responding to new challenges and opportunities to strengthen the GOC justice system. The program will also broaden access to justice through an array of initiatives offering free and timely access to legal services for millions of economically or socially disenfranchised, violence impacted and/or geographically marginalized Colombians.

Four lower level USAID Intermediate Results (IR) areas are anticipated within the JRMP. They are:      

o	IR 1.1.1:  Effective National Implementation of the new Criminal Procedures (Accusatory System) Reform (CPAR); 

o	IR 1.1.2:  Strengthened Court Administration and Management (CAM); 

o	IR 1.1.3:  Increased Access to Justice (ATJ ); and

o	    IR 1.1.4:  - Enhanced Civil Society Roles in Justice Reform and Modernization (CS-JRM).    

For all of the above, assistance will be emphasized in extending justice services to rural, conflict affected, and marginalized populations.

In addition to the above, the USAID program should also be programmatically positioned and structured for possible implementation of an additional future Program Modifier (contingency) intermediate result; implementation of the Justice and Peace Law. This program modifier would be implemented only if future programmatic authorization and additional funding is provided for implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.  

The estimated ceiling amount of the contract is not to exceed $20.5 million. The Contingency Modifier shall not exceed $2 million. 

The RFP is posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fbo.gov)  In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no RFPs will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. Questions must be directed by e-mail to Olga Vallejo, ovallejo@usaid.gov and Sunil Xavier, sxavier@usaid.gov .

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   Amendment #2 Question #1:  In the Description near the beginning is the sentence "Data regarding the industrial liquid addition to solid waste landfill is needed".  Also, near the end is the sentence "The contractor shall prepare and adhere to attachment #1 concerning a  QAPP as it is applied to the analysis of secondary data". These statements appear to be related, but we do not see how they pertain to this quotation. As we understand it, this is a quotation to put together and install a system of hardware and software.  Nowhere else in the description or the  table of deliverables is there any mention of running experiments and collecting data, or doing a literature search to find secondary data. Certainly a QAPP will be needed before collecting data, but there will be no data generated during the installation phase of the project.  So, may these tasks  be excluded? Answer:   The project officer has determined that the requirement for a QAPP is not needed for this requirement.  The following sentence has been removed from the Statement of Work:  "The contractor shall prepare and adhere to attachment #1 concerning a quality assurance project plan  (QAPP) as it applied to the analysis of secondary data".  Task #3 has also been removed from the Deliverable Table.     Amendment 1 to RFQ-OH-06-00046 The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the lysimeter requirement.    US EPA requires four (4) lysimeter vessels.  Therefore, the SOW and all  attachments are changed to indicate that this procurement if for 4 lysimeter vessels.  The RFQ is also amended to reflect the correct size of the lysimeters.  Each lysimeter stack is to be a height of ten (10) feet. In addition to the changes in the specifications, the following clauses are  added to the RFQ:  EPAAR 1552.233-70 Notice of Filing Requirements for Agency Protests; and 1552.211-79, Compliance with EPA Policies for Information Resource Management.  These EPAAR clauses are available at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/ptod/epaar.pdf.

<DESC>To Whom It May Concern:

The National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent agency of the United States Government, is seeking information regarding the long-term (10 or more years) availability of icebreaking services capable of enabling the re-supply of the U.S. Antarctic Program’s (USAP) McMurdo Station.  NSF is the U.S. Government Agency responsible for directing and funding the USAP, and manages the entire United States national program in Antarctica, including logistic support activities, so that the program may be managed as a single package.

Background

NSF is interested in contracting for icebreaking services to annually open a channel through 1-2 year 10/10ths sea ice, and then escort an ice-strengthened tanker and an ice-strengthened cargo ship to the pier at McMurdo Station, located at 77°51’ S, 166°40’ E.   NSF intends for this to be a long-term arrangement.   It is expected that a contract would include annual mobilization and de-mobilization periods (length of time to be determined based on location of home port) and an operating period in the Southern Ocean south of 60° S of approximately 6 to 8 weeks.  After that period the vessel would be off-contract and free to engage in other work.

Traditionally, the USAP has relied on the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to perform the McMurdo break-in and ship escort service using its POLAR class ships.  However, these vessels are 30 years old and are reaching the end of their design life.  NSF is now seeking alternative means of opening the supply channel to McMurdo Station through a reliable long-term arrangement, either with a commercial or governmental provider, or through a multi-national arrangement.     
 
NSF is not seeking binding offers to contract at this time; however, based upon the information received the Foundation may initiate discussions, seek offers, and award a contract with an owner or operator per the authority at 42 U.S.C. 1870(c).


The United States Antarctic Program

Scientific research, and operational support of that research, is the principal activity supported by the United States Government in Antarctica.  The goals are to expand fundamental knowledge of the region, to foster research on global and regional problems of current scientific importance, and to utilize the region as a platform from which to support research.  For projects involving fieldwork, the USAP supports research that can only or can best be done in Antarctica. 

The Program has been in continuous operation since the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year and continuation into the foreseeable future is anticipated.  U.S. activities in Antarctica support the Nation's adherence to the Antarctic Treaty, which reserves the region for peaceful purposes and encourages international cooperation in scientific research.  At present, 45 nations adhere to the treaty, and 29 of them are involved in Antarctic field activities.  The United States cooperates scientifically and operationally with many of the Antarctic Treaty nations.

The major logistics hub for the support of this science is McMurdo Station.  McMurdo is located on Ross Island in the Southern edge of the Ross Sea.  It is the furthest south exposed land to which a ship can sail.  Refer to http://nsf.gov/od/opp/prss/ for a more complete description of the USAP research support facilities including McMurdo Station.


Typical Schedule and Operations

The icebreaker typically arrives at 60° S on or about December 25.  Anticipated departure from McMurdo is mid-February of the following year (6-8 weeks after arrival).   The basic tasks are to open a channel to the McMurdo Station pier, and escort a tanker and a freighter through the sea ice and channel to the pier and back to the open ocean as required

The freighter to be used during the 2005/2006 season will be the AMERICAN TERN (17,350 tons, 158.8m/23.16m).    The tanker to be used will be one of five sister ships of the T-5 class (33,093 tons, 187.5m/21.2m).   Use of supply ships of similar capacity and size are anticipated over the life of the contract.  Additional information on these vessels may be found at:

http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=americantern&type=ContainerShip

… and 

http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=paulbuck&type=GovernmentownedTanker.

The U.S. Navy, Military Sealift Command provides these vessels for the USAP.  The tanker arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about January 16 each year, and departs on or about January 20 each year.  The freighter arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about February 1 each year, and departs on or about February 11 each year.

Sea Ice

The fast ice in McMurdo Sound has typically been between 7 to 10 feet maximum thickness for a distance of 10 to 20 miles from McMurdo.  It is often first or second year ice and had rarely been third year ice until very recently.  Appendix I provides a listing of the extent of sea ice and the vessels used since 1957.   For the past four years there have been extraordinary ice conditions due at least in part to the presence of large icebergs that were partially blocking McMurdo Sound.  For those past four years there has been extensive first year ice with some inclusions of second year ice extending from McMurdo to about 100 miles north.  Ice thicknesses were as great as 12 feet.  Ice in the channel has blown out to open water once in that four-year period, but the surrounding ice extending approximately 14 miles north from McMurdo is multi-year ice.  The two largest of the icebergs have moved out of the area since last year and it is expected that the coming season’s ice should start to return to a more normal status in the short term, but clearly conditions can change rapidly and persist for extended periods.

A chart showing sea ice thickness measurements for 1987 to 2004 is included as Attachment 2.  Recent archival images may be viewed at: http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/subsets/?RossSea/, and http://www.polar.org/sat_image/

Evaluation Information

Interested parties are free to provide any information that they believe may assist NSF in its evaluation of the availability and reliability of icebreaking services; however, the Foundation will not pay for any information submitted.  Except as identified herein, no specific format is required.  

Among the evaluation factors that NSF would consider in determining suitability of an existing or to-be-built vessel for icebreaking services would be:

·	Vessel’s ice classification and maximum ice thickness and speed of advance for continuous progress
·	Vessel’s displacement
·	Statement of availability
·	Ship’s registry
·	Vessel’s or vessels’ name and specifications using BIMCO Supplytime 89, Annex A as the format
·	Name/address of vessel’s owner and vessel’s operator (if different)
·	Certificate of current classification
·	Time remaining prior to any major maintenance activity and dry docking
·	Approximate price per day, and any extras (e.g., taxes, victuals, commissions, communications)
·	Expected mobilization and demobilization charges and port of initiation/return
·	Past performance contact information
·	Special operating restrictions or conditions

It is highly desirable that the vessel have sufficient fuel storage to complete the entire Antarctic operation without any re-fueling from McMurdo.  Please specifically indicate whether the intended vessel has the fuel storage capacity to enable this.  

If the vessel must receive fuel during the period of time while operating in the Southern Ocean, McMurdo can provide an all purpose diesel fuel, JP-5.  Specifications for this fuel are set forth on Page 4 of the publication titled Fuel Users Guide, 2000.  It can be found at http://usapc.army.mil/miscellaneous/2000%20fuel%20users%20guide%20(sep%202000).pdf.  Respondents are asked to review this fuel specification and comment on its suitability.  If another diesel fuel must be used (e.g. MGO or MDO), NSF can have it delivered by the tanker coming to McMurdo.  Please provide an estimate of the quantity of fuel that must be delivered (fuel consumed during mobilization and during ice breaking operations up to the time of the scheduled tanker arrival).  There is no tankage for storage of specialty fuels in McMurdo, thus the fuel must be delivered directly from the tanker.  The tanker cannot deliver heavy fuels.  

Where fuel is expected to be provided at McMurdo, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the approximate price per day.

In the event of a need for heavy fuel, if necessary, the icebreaker could go to New Zealand to refuel – this will take time away from icebreaking duties and is not desirable.  Respondents are asked to indicate if this mode of refueling will be required. 

The Committee of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) is currently developing ballast water management plans for the Antarctic.  A draft management plan is attached.  Please comment on your ability to comply with this plan.


Thank you in advance for your interest in the acquisition programs of the National Science Foundation.  Though NSF will consider any information interested parties choose to submit at any time, the privilege of your submission on or prior to February 28, 2006 is requested.  Inquiries of a technical nature may be addressed to Mr. Michael Van Woert, Executive Officer, Office of Polar Programs, at the letterhead address, Room 755; by telephone to +1 (703) 292-8030; or by e-mail to mvanwoer@nsf.gov.  Submissions and other inquiries may be addressed to the undersigned at the letterhead address, Division of Contracts and Complex Agreements, Room 475; by telephone to +1 (703) 292-8252; or by e-mail to jpate@nsf.gov .

This announcement is a sources sought notice.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD is seeking potential sources for information and no cost product samples of commercially available, non-developmental head and neck restraint systems which may have applicability to military aircraft escape systems.   Submissions will be evaluated to determine if they have potential to mitigate neck injury during the ejection sequence.  Submissions will also be evaluated to confirm that the head mobility needed during normal flight is not inhibited.  Of particular interest to the government are items that may do one or more of the following:  A) Provide restraint for the head during the initial stages of ejection while the aircrew is in the ejection seat.  B) Provide restraint for the head during the later stages of ejection after separation from the seat has occurred.  C) Provide aerodynamic shielding for the helmet during the initial stages of ejection while the aircrew is in the ejection seat.  D) Decrease head borne mass in an ejection while maintaining head and facial protection.  E) Decrease the helmet aerodynamic profile during an ejection while maintaining head and facial protection.  This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY:  Current ejection seat technology provides restraint for the torso, pelvis, arms, and legs up to the time of seat separation from the aircrew.  However, there is no restraint provided for the head and neck other than the headpad behind the head.  There have been a number of technologies explored for neck protection with varying degrees of success.  These have included:  divesting helmet mounted devices, venting helmets, tethering helmet to head pad, tethering helmet to shoulders, supporting neck with airbags, aerodynamic brim on head pad, and aerodynamic fences around head pad.

FACTORS AFFECTING HEAD AND NECK INJURY RISK:  There are a number of factors creating an environment of increased risk of neck injury during ejection.   1) The aviator population has been expanding to include lighter aircrew.  Currently ejection seat aircraft are being designed to accommodate male and female pilots from 103 to 245 lbs.  A typical 103 lb female will have muscular and skeletal neck structure that can not withstand a great deal of loading without injury.  2)  The addition of helmet mounted devices to military aircraft has resulted in ejections with greater head borne masses.  This increase in mass results in increased neck loading during the high g loads experienced in an ejection.  3)  The addition of helmet mounted devices has resulted in an increased aerodynamic profile of the helmet during ejection.  This increase of surface can result in increased neck loading during the high aerodynamic forces experienced in high speed ejections.  4)  The fact that there is no restraint for the head and neck during the initial phases of the ejection other than the head pad can lead to high neck loading in an ejection.  Even the limited restraint provided by the head pad is sometimes lost when the head goes around the side of the head pad.  5)  The fact that there is no restraint for the head and neck after separation from the seat can lead to high neck loads during parachute opening shock.

PURPOSE:  Product samples and supporting information provided in response to this announcement will be reviewed to determine whether the device provided has potential to mitigate one or more of causes listed above.  All devices should have a minimal detriment on the pilot’s ability to physically perform their flight tasks which includes extensive head and neck motion during the course of a mission.  Those submittals which show the most promise will be tested by the government with the goal of evaluating the devices effectiveness in reducing injury risk throughout the entire ejection event.  Test methods employed may include but not be limited to windblast tests to simulate aerodynamic effects during the initial stages of ejection and horizontal accelerator tests to simulate effect inertial loading during the catapult, drogue, and parachute opening shock phases of ejection.  In addition to testing, integration assessments may be performed to examine the potential for the device to interface with the full range of aircrew anthropometry, aircrew equipment, ejection seat equipment and the aircraft cockpit.  Data gathered from these tests will not only help the government to determine the current state of technology in this area, it will also provide a basis for developing requirements for any future efforts to procure head and neck restraint devices.  

INFORMATION AND MATERIALS REQUIRED:  Interested parties will be asked to provide at least two product samples to support the testing and assessments outlined above.  In addition, written submittals of test data, design information, performance limitations or instructions for use would be helpful in determining the potential benefits of the device and insuring it is tested in a way which fully evaluates its performance.  The written information is key to determining whether the system has merit and warrants further testing.  

Submittal Information:  This IS NOT a Request For Proposal nor does the government intend to pay for any information/items submitted in response to this synopsis.  This synopsis does not commit the government to award any future contracts.  Interested sources should send product samples and related information to NAWCAD by 15 February 2006.  The product samples and information should be sent to Matthew Conrad,NAWCAD Bldg. 2187 Suite 1280, 48110 Shaw Road Unit 5, Patuxent River MD  20670.  Product samples will be returned only at the source’s request and expense unless the samples are destroyed during testing.  Test data obtained on a submitted device will be shared with the source and if requested, a debrief of the governments findings will be provided.  All technical questions must be submitted in writing and mailed to the above address or emailed to the POC provided below.

G&T established the System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program to assist emergency responders in performing their duties.  The SAVER Program established and is supported by a network of partners and associates who perform the actual assessment and validation activities.  Visit the SAVER Program Web site at http://saver.tamu.edu for more information on the SAVER Program or to view additional reports on a variety of emergency responder specific technologies. All information received will be treated as public knowledge; therefore, vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this Request for Information (RFI).  Specific information sought includes: (1) A brief description (75 words or less) of the product or service; (2) Potential applications and usefulness in emergency operations usually deployed in missions that include but are not limited to search and rescue, explosives, health hazards, etc.; (3) Functionality based on the potential applications and compatibility/interoperability of the system or device with other emergency responder technologies and equipment; (4) Costs, including unit, operating, warranty, and maintenance costs, and repair facility location; (5) Technical specifications and industry standards such as size, mounting, use in hazardous and harsh environments, power requirements, communications protocols, integration with logical systems, weight, and operating temperatures; (6) A copy of the product or serviceâ€™s data sheet and operating parameters; (7) A listing of current users (with points of contact); (8) The name and phone number/e-mail address of the individual that potential users should contact for more information on the device; and (9) Electronic copies of diagrams, drawings, and/or graphics that would assist the user in understanding the device or system.

Defense Logistics Agency
Defense Supply Center Richmond


PROGRAM OVERVIEW

Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for packaged petroleum, lubricants, oils, and compressed gases (Federal Supply Classes 6830 and 9150) became law on November 8, 2005.  Cylinders and valves (FSC 8120) are implicitly included in this initiative, and all ozone depleting substances are excluded.  The Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) will lead the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in this effort by transforming this portion of chemical supply chain through reductions in chemical use, waste, and lifecycle costs, for all of DLA’s continental U.S. (CONUS) customers and potentially OCONUS (overseas) customers.  Presently, DLA uses a multitude of sources, storage facilities, and delivery methods to satisfy its customers’ hazardous material needs.  DLA’s intention is to leverage the commercial industry and implement regional chemical management services programs across the U.S.  This initiative is designed to assure readiness, safety, and efficiency.  Ultimately, DLA’s goal is to improve lead-times, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction while allowing the customers to focus on their core competencies.

Anticipated Scope of Services:

Forecasting collaboration with customers - Accurately predicting future customer requirements/demand patterns.

Procurement/Purchasing - All actions related to acquisition planning, solicitation, evaluation, negotiations, contract award, contract administration, and contract management functions.

Inventory Management/Storage/Warehousing - The direction and control of activities with the purpose of getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time in the right quantity in the right form at the right cost.

Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) services (to include disposal) – To provide an effective, sound, environmentally safe and occupational health management system.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with other pertinent procedures, regulations, manuals, and guidance documents that support environmentally sound management.

Customer Direct - Ship directly to joint warfighter customers across a broad spectrum of locations both CONUS and potentially OCONUS.  Deliver items using shipping methods defined by terms and conditions of the contract (i.e. required delivery date, packaging requirements, delivery address, special instructions for emergency or other needs).  Track the delivery of items. 

Data Management - to include interoperability with industry and government systems.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW

Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for packaged petroleum, lubricants, oils, and compressed gases (Federal Supply Classes 6830 and 9150) became law on November 8, 2005.  Cylinders and valves (FSC 8120) are implicitly included in this initiative, and all ozone depleting substances are excluded.  The Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) will lead the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in this effort by transforming this portion of chemical supply chain through reductions in chemical use, waste, and lifecycle costs, for all of DLA’s continental U.S. (CONUS) customers and potentially OCONUS (overseas) customers.

Statement of Work for the Gypsy Moth (+) Disparlure String Dispense

 Background 

Gypsy moth pheromone dispensers are used in traps to detect infestation outside of generally infested areas. Once an infestation has been detected, a grid of traps (from 16 to 49 traps per square mile) is used to delimit the area of infestation. Although the number of the traps used in detection survey can be fairly well predicted from year-to-year, the use for delimiting will vary. 

Pheromone dispensers are also used for mass trapping as a control measure. This technique uses nine traps per acre, usage rates for this purpose varies. In addition pheromone dispensers are used to monitor populations in and along the edge of the generally infested area. 

Specifications — Standard Life (+) Disparlure 

PVC String Dispensers The PVC string dispensers are constructed of twisted nylon twine, coated with a mixture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and (+) disparlure (0.6 % by weight). 

Dispensers provided under this contract are subject to first article approval — Government testing using laboratory and field bioassays before effecting delivery. The dispensers shall fully satisfy specifications; and specifically, the following criteria in USDA conducted aging tests. 

Standard life dispensers shall provide an initial release rate of 100-200 ng/hr and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of aging in a greenhouse (average temperature of 32 degrees centigrade), they will have a release rate of> 30 ng/hr. The method describe by Leonhardt et al 1990 shall be used to measure release rates in the laboratory at a constant temperature of 35 degrees centigrade. The average residual (+) disparlure content of dispensers shall be at least 100 ug of (+) disparlure after 12 weeks of greenhouse aging. Data for emission rates and residual contents shall be developed on at least 10 replicate dispensers produced using the same process and equipment the manufacturer intend to use for the production run. 

Standard life PVC string design dispensers shall be constructed of multi-stranded nylon twine (1.5 mm diam X 14 to 16 cm long) coated with a mixture of PVC (+) disparlure (6.9 ul or (+) disparlure per gram of liquid PVC by weight). The total loading (+) disparlure concentration on the coated twine will be approximately 33 ug/cm of string length. Pages will contain the date of manufacture. Construction should be such that previously describe release rate and residual content specification are met 

Specification for (+) disparlure (cis-7, 8-epoxy-2 methyloctadecane) 

General Purity Government furnished (+) Disparlure Disparlure approved for use will be provided to the Contractor by the Government. The general purity shall be as follow: 

1. Colorless clear liquid a (slight straw discoloration may be tolerated) 
2. Completely distillable at 110 degrees C <0.5 m (0.5% residue). 
3. Reflective index n 1.4435 +1- 0.001. 
4. IR and NMR (match standard). 
5. Contains 95% cis 7, 8 — epoxy -2 —methyloctadecane as measured by gas chromatographic analysis on a 60 m by 0.25 mm i.d. capillary column coated with DB-1 (non — polar and programmed as follows): 

Two (2) mi isothermal at 100 degrees C, then 10 degrees/mm. to 250 degrees C, where it is held for 10 minutes. A flame ionization detector is used for analysis. The retention time of disparlure and the olefin impurity on the BC-l column with hydrogen carrier gas are given below. Other capillary columns of equivalent or better resolution may also give acceptable results. 
Compound: 				Retention -  Time (Min) 
cis7, 8-epoxy-2methyloctadecane 	+17.34 
trans-7, 8epoxy-2 methyloctadecane	 +17.21 
2-methyk-Z-7-octadecane 		+15.38 

Optical rotation: 25 
A 	+0.8 +/- 0.2 	(10% CC1) 
	       D 

Standards 
The approved (+) disparlure material meets both the enantiomeric purity standard and the biological activity standard as described below. 

Enantiomeric Purity 
1. Based on measurements on intermediates: > 99% (+) disparlure la. Based on measurements using USDA analysis (Oliver and Vadee J. Chem. Ecology 21(2)1995) contains less than 0.3% of the (-) disparlure isomer. 

2. The proposed method of synthesis shall be submitted with offers submitted in response to this solicitation along with the intended procedure for predicting the optical purity of the final product based on measured purity of the intermediates in the synthesis.

3. Published synthesis are listed below:

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY 

The (÷) disparlure produces a male trap catch of Lymatria dispar equal to or greater than that produced by a USDA standard (÷) disparlure at 4 concentrations (10 ug, 100 ug, 1000 ug, and 5000 ug/trap). The test procedure utilizes replicates in a complete randomized block design. Test compounds will be dispensed in 1000 ul of hexane onto cotton wicks. These dispensers are then placed in gypsy moth traps.

The contractor shall prepare a separate Technical quotation.   The technical quotation shall not include any pricing information.  The technical quotation shall be prepared in two parts.
1). CAPABILITIES/QUALIFICATION STATEMENT
This part shall include a description of the capabilities and qualifications of the contractor showing in their best light, why they are capable of doing the job, and why they should be considered for the work.  As a part of this section, quoters are requested to submit past performance information that as closely as possible matches the scope and type of work that will be required under this BPA.

2).  TEST WORK SAMPLE

The Test Work Sample is to be prepared using the information provided in the document entitled ¡§Test Work Sample Source Document¡¨ following all of the instructions presented in the Request for Quotations and attachments.

The quoter should provide with the Test Work Sample, a separate document showing the error(s) that they detected, and the corrective action taken.


ORAL PRESENTATION	
As a portion of their quotation, the quoter may, at the Government¡¦s election, be required to make an oral presentation to the Government, at the Government¡¦s offices in Lexington, KY, at a date and time of the Government¡¦s choosing.  The major intent of the oral presentation is to answer probing questions designed to reveal the extent of the contractor¡¦s, responsibility, capability, qualifications, experience, and understanding of the work.  Standard presentations, elaborate handouts and/or audio/visuals or time consuming presentations are not wanted and may be considered to indicate the contractor¡¦s lack of understanding of the Government¡¦s preference for economy and efficiency.
