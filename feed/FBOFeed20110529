<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. This is a Request for Proposal and the solicitation number is VA-101-11-0044. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51
This is a solicitation (see attached file) targeting only Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM) has a need for contractor/s to provide support to implement VA’s Enhanced-Use Lease program so as to enable the Department to formulate, evaluate, and execute multiple enhanced-use leases on a nation-wide basis.
The Enhanced-Use Lease Authority (EUL), Title 38 United States Code Sections 8161-8169, allows the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to out lease facilities (available land, buildings, and other resources) to improve services, provide facilities, and/or generate revenue.  EULs are long-term leases (up to 75 years) of facilities under VA’s jurisdiction of control to the public or private sector.  The facility can be used for both VA and compatible non-VA uses.  In return, VA receives cash and/or goods, services, facilities, or other “in-kind” consideration.
To date there have been over 58 EULs executed nationally.  Examples of projects executed via EUL include senior housing for Veterans, transitional and permanent housing for homeless Veterans, affordable housing for Veterans, assisted Living for Veterans, medical and research facilities, parking garages, child care centers/adult day health care and VA Office Co-locations.  
VA intends to acquire the services necessary to satisfy this requirement through competitive means under Public Law (PL) 109-461, and Information Letter (IL) 049-07-08 Veterans First Contracting Program. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 8127(d), SDVOSB firms must complete 51 percent of the work.  VA is also encouraging SDVOSB to create joint ventures under FAR Part 9 among one or more SDVOSB firms to help facilitate performing the tasks required and to subcontract where needed the appropriate percentage for needed expertise.  
The complete solicitation document file is attached. All questions should be emailed to maina.gakure@va.gov by June 1, 2011 and a response to the questions will be posted as an amendment to the solicitation. The associated NAICS code is 531390 (Other activities related to real estate) 
This solicitation closes on Monday June 13 2011 at 10.00 am (EST).  Point of contact is maina.gakure@va.gov or 202 461 6849. Interested contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and verified at www.vetbiz.

PLEASE SUMMIT AN ELECTRONIC COPY OF THE PROPOSAL JUNE 13 2011 CLOSE TIME
