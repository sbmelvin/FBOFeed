<SUBJECT>A--SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION--Noninvasive or minimally invasive delineation of DNAPL in the subsurface
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-CTCPIPA-RFI-1
<RESPDATE>040502
<ARCHDATE>04202002
<CONTACT>Tiffany Zachry, Communications, Phone 435-755-8237, Fax 412-577-2660, Email zachryt@ctcgsc.org
<DESC>Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC) is seeking information on current technology that can be applied in a proof-of-concept demonstration to delineate the source term of dense, nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs).  The technology must be noninvasive or minimally invasive and must not pose any risk of migrating DNAPL sources.  The primary objective of this proof-of-concept demonstration is to locate the extent of DNAPL in the vadose zone at the A-014 Outfall of the A/M Area at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Site.  Upon successful demonstration, the technology(ies) are expected to be applied to other DOE locations with known or suspected DNAPL contamination.

Historical records indicate that between 1952 and 1979, a significant amount of process waste was discharged into a process sewer system and released at the A-014 Outfall.  This waste consisted of chlorinated solvents (72% tetrachloroethylene [PCE], 27% trichloroethylene [TCE], and a small quantity of 1,1,1-trichloroethane) and other co-disposed waste materials (acids, caustics, salts, and lubricants).  Based on previous investigative results, a soil vapor extraction system was installed and has been in operation since 1996 to remove chlorinated solvents by way of applying vacuum through several extraction wells.  Contamination in the region encompassed by the zone of influence of these extraction wells has been substantially reduced, based on FY01 ground-truth results of 275 samples from six borings in the area.  However, DNAPL contamination has been found in several areas within 50 feet of the extraction wells: at depths ranging from 6 feet below surface level to 30 feet below surface.  DNAPL was confirmed by gas chromatographic analysis of collected soil samples and by employing a ribbon NAPL sampler.  The new findings reveal that some region(s) in A-014 Outfall remain contaminated with DNAPL, and delineation of the extent of this contamination is the focus of the proof-of-concept demonstration described in this Request for Information.

The site geology, which consists primarily of layers of sand, silt, and clay (predominately kaolinitic), is heterogeneous both vertically and laterally and is typical of the Atlantic coastal plain.  The majority of DNAPL contamination is believed to exist in a shallow region, i.e., less than 65 feet below surface level.  The new investigative area for this proof-of-concept demonstration is estimated to be 150 feet long * 100 feet wide * 65 feet deep.  There is a significant number of surface interferences in the area or close by including an overhead power line, stainless steel and PVC wells, a soil vapor extraction unit, and a stream monitoring station.

Only United States entities/citizens are requested to respond to this announcement. Interested parties are asked to submit a white paper not to exceed three pages (per technology area) and a maximum of two resumes (not to exceed two pages each).  The white paper must contain: (1) a description of the technologies potentially applicable to the proof-of-concept demonstration, (2) a brief summary of experience in this technical field, and (3) the expected spatial resolution for free-phase DNAPL.  The format is at the discretion of the potential offeror.  All proprietary information should be marked.  Responses will be handled accordingly.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Only those respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered to participate in a vendors' day event, which is planned for the morning of April 18, 2002.  The vendors' day event will include a site tour, a briefing on previous investigative findings, and a question and answer session.  Invited vendors will incur all expenses associated with participating in this vendors' day event, as no payment from CTC will be available.

Qualified respondents may be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  However, this notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposal, and it is not a commitment by CTC to procure products or services.  Responding vendors should provide information regarding this announcement to the identified point of contact via electronic transmission.  This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by CTC, nor will CTC pay for the information solicited.

POINTS OF CONTACT: Chester J. Maciag, Program Manager, 315-330-3184, email: chester.maciag@rl.af.mil; Joe Giordano, Technical Advisor, 315-330-4199, email: joe.Giordano@rl.af.mil; Joetta A. Bernhard, Contracting Officer, 315-330-2308, email: joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil.  AFRL/IF is soliciting White Papers for various studies, capabilities and experiments to increase the Air Force's understanding and capabilities in the area of INFORMATION WARFARE within the context of Joint Vision 2020 and AFDD 2-5. US Forces require rapid access to a wide variety of information to perform their missions. The information required must be reliable and specific information tied to planned operations must be protected. We must preserve and ensure the integrity of our information from exploitation and corruption while denying, delaying, or confusing our potential adversary's ability to act in battle. Innovative research and development approaches are being sought in the INFORMATION WARFARE areas of, (1) information warfare planning functions, (2) improved concepts to deny the adversary's ability to decide and act in battle, (3) maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our information elements, (4) the ability to recover from information attacks, (5) automated methodologies to determine susceptibilities and vulnerabilities of information systems, (6) methods to secure commercial-off-the-shelf applications, (7) capabilities to determine what information systems will be attacked for indications and warnings, trans-attack, and post-mortem phases  (8) capabilities for digital, computer, and network forensics and analysis.  Concepts and capabilities are needed to support a wide variety of missions including worldwide joint and coalition missions. Priority will be given to those ideas which most significantly increase the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our information systems and which have the widest global applicability. In addition, consideration will be given to those concepts with an understanding of adversarial command and control structures as well as the variations in threat systems. The new concepts and capabilities should address the Counter Information needs of US and allied systems for information warfare. The full spectrum of military operations should be considered.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.   Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a 3 - 5 page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, women-owned small, or small disadvantaged business, or Historically Black College, University, or Minority Institution. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company, Section B: Task Objective, and Section C: Technical Summary.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Chester J. Maciag, Reference BAA-96-10-IFKA, AFRL/IFGB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, (2) innovativeness of proposed approach and/or techniques, (3) assessed improvement to Information Warfare capabilities, and (4) the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fees. Also the offer's capability and capacity to achieve the objectives of this BAA will be used. No other evaluation criteria will be used in selecting proposals.  Criteria 1-3  above will also be used to determine whether the White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submissions under this BAA.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  All responsible firms may submit a white paper which shall be considered.  Principal funding of this BAA and the award of contracts started in FY97. Individual awards will not normally exceed 12 to 24 months in duration, with dollar amounts normally ranging from $200K to $750K. Total funding for this BAA is $15M. 
Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to a foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, AFRL/IFKA, ATTN: Joetta Bernhard, 26 Electronic Pky, Rome, NY 13441-4514, or phone at (315) 330-2308, for information if they contemplate responding. 
The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  The work to be performed may require a SECRET/NOFORN facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET/NOFORN information at time of award.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be ''significant concerns'' and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta Bernhard, (315) 330-2308. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Linda Reed, Deputy Chief, Contracting Division, at (315) 330-7748. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. 
An information briefing is not planned.  To maximize the possibility of award in FY02, it is recommended that white papers be received by 01 JUL 2002. White papers submitted after that date will also be considered but funding may be limited.  This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 2002.  To receive a copy of the AFRL/IFK publication ''BAA & PRDA: a Guide For Industry",  Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) for a research effort entitled "Proof Test Design & Analysis: NASGRO (Nonlinear Fatigue Crack Growth) Modules." NASA/MSFC intends to purchase subject research effort from Southwest Research Institute (SWRI), San Antonio, Texas.  This procurement includes development, integration, and verification of software modules which incorporate existing flaw geometries and proof test methodologies with elastic-plastic fracture mechanics solutions, previously developed by SWRI, into the NASGRO fracture mechanics code.  These software modules are an essential part of NASA's needs for design and analysis of structural elements in space flight hardware and ground support.  SWRI has the unique capabilities and techniques that cannot be duplicated in a timely or cost effective manner.  The elastic-plastic fracture and proof test methodologies developed by SWRI are immediately available and directly applicable to the development of these software modules.  Only SWRI can provide the technical expertise required to continue this work within the period of performance and estimated cost.  Prior involvement with elastic-plastic fracture and proof test research efforts has placed SWRI at the forefront of technical understanding of elastic-plastic methodologies as well as how to integrate these methodologies into the NASGRO code.  Market research indicates that no other source has pursued or developed practical analytical tools for design and assessment of proof testing in the elastic-plastic regime.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 22, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. NASA/GRC intends to purchase these services from UES, Inc.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Since UES has a patent on the K5 series of TiAl, no other source is presently known to possess a similar composition that can successfully withstand temperatures above 875 degrees C.   Interested firms have until March 5, 2002 to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their qualifications/capabilities.  Such qualifications/capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses received after this date or without the required information will be considered nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered.  A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Mr. William Donaldson, Contracting Officer, (781) 271-6091, Ms. Janet Maille, Contract Specialist, (781) 271-6372
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a notice to all potential offerors that, on or about 22 March 2002, the (MILSATCOM) Program Office anticipates the release on the HERBB website (www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil) of Request for Proposal F19628-01-R-0033 for the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-Of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) Contract.  The overall objective of the FAB-T program is to design, develop, fabricate, install and test a family of terminals.  The terminals will support Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) MILSATCOM system communications modes which include high data rate (XDR) up to eight megabits per second.  The terminals will be configured to allow future upgrading through modular or layered hardware upgrades using common components and standardized interfaces.  The terminal must also be backward compatible with the existing EHF systems, e.g., MILSTAR, UFO-E.  A "family of terminals" is envisioned to support a variety of missions, users, and platforms. Missions include:  nuclear airborne and ground fixed/ground transportable C2, nuclear airborne force element and airborne command post operations, non-nuclear airborne force element and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR).  Users include:  National Command Authority, STRATCOM, Army, Navy, ACC, and AMC.  Platforms include:  B-2, B-52, E-4B, E-6B, and ground fixed and ground transportable Command Post Terminals. The program objective for the family of terminals includes leveraging hardware and software commonality to provide a cost-effective solution to a variety of requirements.  An evolutionary acquisition approach is envisioned using spiral development.   The first capability increment is a 72 month development effort that is time phased to meet operational needs for a B-2 force element capability, command post partial capability for satellite command and control, development of the full command post capability, and a B-52 prototype.  The contingency antenna will be an option CLIN.  Funding for this increment is expected to be approximately $300M.  Future program increments will include but not be limited to GBS-receive, Ka, and Ku. Past performance information will be due 14 days after RFP release.  We will be using a split proposal process for this solicitation.  Offerors will be provided 30 days from RFP release to provide the technical proposal and an additional amount of time to provide the cost proposal after completion of evaluations.  Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted.  Firms responding to this request shall indicate whether they are a large business, small business, very small business, small-disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  Respondents must specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm.  Interested Contractors desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System.  This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, not should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from interested firms during this phase of the acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or the Contracting Officer, but communicates concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government official.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of responses, source selection, or formulation of acquisition strategy.  The Electronic Systems Center's Ombudsman is Colonel Joseph Maryeski, ESC/CO, (781) 377-5106. The Ombudsman should be contacted only with issues or problems that have been brought previously to the attention of the Program Manager and/or ContractingOfficer and could not be resolved satisfactorily at that level.  Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  Please direct any questions on this NOCA to ESC/MCK, 50 Griffiss Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-1620, Attn: Mr. William Donaldson, Contracting Officer, (tel: 781-271-6091, e-mail:  Bill.Donaldson@hanscom.af.mil) or Ms. Janet Maille, Contract Specialist, (tel: 781-271-6372, e-mail:  Janet.Maille@hanscom.af.mil).  The Government anticipates a Request for Proposal release on or about 22 March 2002 with a contract award on or about 28 June 2002.  See Note 26.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager previously identified.

<DESC>This announcement is for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the Intelligence Data Handling System (IDHS) Intelligence Information Processing and Production (I2P2) program.  Robins Air Force Base, GA seeks to award a 12-month "Bridge" extension to the current I2P2 contract, F09603-97-D-0008, which expires 30 Jun 2002.  The incumbent contractor is General Dynamics, CAGE 14210.  The follow-on acquisition, called "Intelligence Information, Command and Control, Equipment and Enhancements" (ICE2) is currently underway but will not award in time to continue uninterrupted CLS coverage by the Government's need date of 01 Jul 2002.  The security regulation supporting this program require contractor personnel be cleared to the TOP SECRET/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) level to perform at the more than 200 sites worldwide.  The security clearance process takes nine to twelve months to accomplish.  In addition, there is a requirement for Technical Expert Status Accreditation (TESA) for performance at sites in Germany.  The TESA process is a means by which the German government agrees to waive taxation for contractor personnel with high degrees of technical expertise.  Without this certification, the contract costs for Germany are increased by 140 percent.  The TESA process cannot start until after award of a new contract.  These requirements limit the proposed bridge effort to the incumbent.  Point of contact for information pertaining to this acquisition is Darryl C. Turner, Contracting Officer-I2P2, WR-ALC/LEKVB, Phone:  (478) 926-0880, Fax:  (478) 926-4927, email:  Darryl.Turner@robins.af.mil

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Extramural Research (OER), to procure professional services on a sole source basis with Ms. Delores B. Montgomery, Temple Hills, MD, to continue services currently being provided by the contractor under an existing purchase order.  The contractor will continue to provide the expertise required in the development and classification of a number of Federal General Schedule, Senior Executive Service, and Title 42 position descriptions, crediting plans, evaluation statements, performance plans, and other associated documentation.  The period of performance will be April 15, 2002 through April 14, 2003 with one-year option period.  The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that deliverables are classified consistent with up-to-date position classification and job grading standards published by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Either sample position descriptions or sufficient background information for each requirement under this purchase order will be provided to the contractor to facilitate her efforts and can be used as a basis for creating, revising, rewriting, and classifying the new and reinvented positions of the OER.  The contractor shall also be required to develop crediting plans, develop comprehensive evaluation statements, perform job analysis, and conduct desk audits.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that all requested deliverables conform to current NIH and OPM requirements for such documents.  These position descriptions and associated documentation, when and as requested, will be for the recruitment, retention, reclassification, and/or promotion of staff recently involved in several reorganizations and realignments within the OER.  The immediate and continuous commitment of a professional service contractor is necessary to insure that position classification and job grading standards are applied consistently in the orderly realignments already in progress.  Ms. Delores B. Montgomery has provided professional consultant services in the classification and compensation area to the OER and its component offices since 1997 on an as needed basis.  It is now apparent that as a result of additional and continuing reorganizations, functional realignments in the OER, and new and updated job grading standards and position classifications published by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), another fifty or more position descriptions and crediting plans, or related evaluation statements, performance plans, statement of differences, and justifications are needed over the next two years to fully reflect the proposed staffing of the ongoing update and realignment of OER's existing organizational structure.  Ms. Montgomery has over thirty three (33) years of experience in writing position descriptions for Federal grades and series.  Ms. Montgomery possesses the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the work.  In addition, Ms. Montgomery, has already submitted preliminary drafts of position descriptions for newly defined activities in several of our component offices, and is awaiting further instructions for classifying these positions.  Ms. Montgomery has the background knowledge and documentation to complete the classification of proposed positions as well as a thorough understanding of the OER, its mission, and function both in relation to the Office of the Director as well as to the other Institutes, Centers, and Divisions of the NIH.  While these additional requirements were not anticipated when OER chose Ms. Montgomery to consult on classification issues, it is now in the best interest of the government to solicit Ms. Montgomery to complete the process of classifying and reevaluating duties and functions performed in OER and its component offices.  With all of the background information at hand, familiarity with the classifications already done and their relationship to each other, Ms. Montgomery is the only person capable of completing our staffing requirements with fairness and consistency.  Timeliness is also a factor in acquiring the services of Ms. Montgomery because new positions, resulting from the establishment/reorganization of offices, must be completed before the end of the Fiscal Year.  Therefore, it is the intention of the NIH, Office of Extramural Research, to procure on a sole-source basis the professional and specialized services of Ms. Delores B. Montgomery.  Introducing a new contractor at this point in time would add significant amount of time, government coordination, and therefore costs to the government.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIH.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide professional service as stated above.  Responses should sufficiently demonstrate the firm's ability to meet the government's requirements.  Responses are required within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. NLM-02-081-UHP.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, NLM on (301) 496?6127.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, FL, intends to solicit and award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Philips Analytical, 12 Michigan Drive, Natick, MA 01760, (770) 578-5115.  This award will be made under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Commercial Acquisition and FAR Part 13.5 test program for certain commercial items.  This is notification to interested parties.  The solicitation number for this announcement is F33DOL20500100.  This contract is for a HTK 16 High-Temperature Camera component upgrade to an existing Philips XPert-Pro X-Ray Diffractometer currently in use at the Energetic materials Branch HERD Facility.  The upgrade will allow experiments to be conducted at elevated temperatures for the purpose of structure determination and phase behavior examination.  The system consists of the temperature chamber, a controller, and an adapter to fit onto the existing equipment.  Four different heating filaments are included so that different temperature ranges can be reached and adequately maintained in the different atmospheres expected to be utilized during testing.  The temperature chamber has a moving sample holder that adjusts for the thermal expansion of the heating element.  The temperature controller allows the chamber to be heated up to 1600C and can ramp up from room temperature to this maximum in approximately 20 seconds, thus alleviating thermal delay during measurements.  The camera has an integrated alignment slit which allows for very accurate positioning even at elevated temperatures.  A high vacuum system will allow experiments to be conducted in a variety of atmospheres (vacuum, nitrogen, argon, etc.), which is pivotal to the work currently being performed by the Advanced Energetics team.  A verification sample is used to check the setup of the system and validate the results obtained.  A complete listing of items required is available upon request.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 334517.  Please identify whether or not you are a small or large business based on the NAICS code.  The size standard for the NAICS code is 500 employees.  If your company is capable of providing these items, qualification packages should be received within 15 days of publication for this synopsis.  All responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M., Central Standard Time on 20 March 2002.  Send all packages to Christi OLeary, 205 West D.

<DESC>The Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is recompeting their current contract with Quality Biological, Inc., Contract Number N01-AI-65278.  This solicitation will be a 100% Small Business Set-Aside, NAICS Code 54171, 500 employees.  DAIDS is committed to the development of HIV/AIDS vaccines and other prevention strategies (e.g., topical microbicides) for worldwide use in stemming the AIDS epidemic. While industry, government, and academia have all targeted considerable resources to this end over the past 15 years, identification of an efficacious vaccine against HIV/AIDS has yet to be accomplished.  Therefore, the highest priority of the DAIDS continues to be the discovery and evaluation of HIV/AIDS vaccines.  In this effort DAIDS supports basic, preclinical, and clinical research to identify vaccine strategies against HIV/AIDS.   To facilitate this research, the DAIDS has long provided the research community with standardized, quality-controlled reagents through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program.  However, large-scale preclinical and clinical vaccine and prevention research studies, such as those carried out by DAIDS-sponsored Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units (SVEUs) and the expanded international HIV Vaccine/Prevention Trial Networks (HVTN and HPTN), require larger quantities of such reagents not typically available through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program.  Therefore, to advance the vaccine development process, DAIDS is seeking ways to generate and acquire reagents and technologies as needed for sponsored AIDS vaccine/prevention research and development projects.  Many such reagents are not commercially available and require customized production and quality control.  Reagents required for this research include but are not limited to viral gene products and associated peptides, adjuvants, cytokines, virus stocks, expression vectors (including recombinant plasmid DNAs and RNAs), monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, topical microbicides, and sometimes unforeseen but timely produced reagents.  These reagents will be generated for evaluating vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy.  The current Contractor supports a facility to produce or otherwise acquire these types of reagents for AIDS vaccine research and has the capability to store, maintain, assure quality control and distribute large quantities of reagents.  This contract is utilized by nearly all facets of the vaccine development program funded by DAIDS.  Grantees, contractors, and other investigators regularly make requests through this DAIDS contract to obtain essential reagents for their vaccine development studies.  In addition, novel procedures are often developed for optimizing the production of these reagents (e.g., greater yields and higher purity).  Offerors will be expected to:  1) produce (either through purchase or other means), purify, and test reagents for the DAIDS Vaccine and Prevention Research Program; these reagents include an array of viral proteins and peptides, virus stocks, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, topical microbicides, vaccine adjuvants and cytokines, and any additional reagents deemed necessary for the DAIDS vaccine program, 2) have capabilities for genetic cloning and sequencing, 3) be capable of producing and testing unique and customized reagents at the request of the program, including preparing and/or producing soluble proteins, expression vectors, and gene products (including experimental AIDS vaccines) under current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) or Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) as appropriate for their intended use, and preparing and/or producing these in large-scale production lots, 4) be able to analyze all acquired or generated reagents for purity and integrity, and to provide for their quality control and assurance, and 5) provide appropriate facilities for receipt and inventory tracking, storage, maintenance and distribution of all reagents.  The Contractor will be monitored by regular communications between the NIAID Project Officer and the contract Principal Investigator and through site visits by DAIDS staff.  NIAID will receive written reports (quarterly updates and annual reports) as well as reports of data from individual studies in progress.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of seven (7) years, beginning approximately February 14, 2003.  The total effort is estimated to be approximately 76,285 total labor hours or 37 FTEs.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIDS-03-01 will be available electronically on or about March 14, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract --and will also be posted on FedBizOpps.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is soliciting proposals for the Preparation of the Report on Carcinogens.  The objective of this contract is to procure assistance in preparing the Report on Carcinogens (RoC) and the Background Documents used in the review of nominations for listing and delisting in the RoC.  The RoC is a congressionally mandated document that lists agents, substances, mixtures or exposure circumstances that are known or reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens.  The responsibility for preparing the RoC has been delegated to the National Toxicology Program (NTP).  Substances, agents, mixtures or exposure circumstances that are being considered by the NTP for possible listing or delisting in the RoC  are evaluated by a review process consisting of sequential reviews by distinct scientific review committees.  The Background Documents are documents which summarize all relevant exposure, regulatory and carcinogenicity information specific for each nomination and are used in the reviews for possible listing or delisting of substances in the RoC.  The statement of work consists of two Tasks: the preparation of Background Documents for review of nominations to the RoC and the preparation of the RoC itself, both of which shall be measured end products.  The preparation of the Background Document project has two types of end products associated with it, the establishment of "expert panels" (estimated not to exceed 10 per year) and the preparation of the completed Background Documents (estimated not to exceed 10 per year).  An expert panel, consisting of scientist(s) with expertise and/or knowledge pertaining to the carcinogenicity for a specific nomination will be identified to help in the preparation of each background document.  The background documents are reports used in the review process that summarize all relevant exposure, regulatory and carcinogenicity information specific for each nomination. The preparation of the RoC project requires the production of one type of end product (estimated not to exceed three for the entire contract), the pre-publication draft of the RoC.  The RoC is a composite of Summary Profiles, each of which contain a breif description of the carcinogenicity, exposure and regulatory information for a specific agent, for all listed human carcinogens. NAICS 541710. Period of performance will be for six years. The estimated level of effort for each year is 1,880 professional (PhD. Level) person-hours, 3,760 professional (M.A. level or below) person-hours, and 4,700 administrative person-hours.   The expected release date of the RFP is  March 27, 2002 with proposals due on May 10, 2002. A copy of the solicitation will be available on the internet at: http://www.niehs.nih.gov/dert/rcb/rfp.htm. Those individuals who wish to access the on-line version should follow the instructions provided in the on-line solicitation package. After examination of these documents, any firm interested in responding to this RFP must request the entire RFP in writing via email at 
doylej@niehs.nih.gov, telephone (919) 541-0424, or fax (919) 541-2712. This requirement is restricted to 100% small business set-aside. See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to procure on a sole source basis with Tom Charlton, No. Kingstown, RI to develop a simple model of thermally induced errors in coordinates reported by coordinate measuring machines (CMMs), under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) ONLY ONE SOURCE REASONABLY AVAILABLE.  Specific tasks include:  1) developing the machine classification schema; 2) developing the mathematical model of the coordinate responses to thermal inputs; and 3) identify details important for the implementation of the class models in uncertainty simulation.  A written report upon completion of each task is required.  This is a sole source procurement because the Contractor is an internationally recognized expert on the effects of temperature on positioning machinery such as CMMs and is the world's foremost expert on the subject of thermal compensation.  The proposed Contractor initiated the very first drift testing of a commercial CMM and crafted the difficult compromise language on thermal derating that appears in ANSI/ASME Std. B89.4.1 Performance Evaluation of CMMs; and, developed the first methodology to correctly handle the errors associated with translation of the axis of rotation due to thermal growth in a four-axis CMM.  A firm fixed price purchase order is expected to be awarded by March 25, 2002.  The period of performance will be twenty-four weeks.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; no competitive solicitation will be issued; however, the Government will consider all quotes or other information received by 03/18/02.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) is not available. See note 26.

<DESC>Amendment No. A002 to EMV-2002-RQ-0011 is issued to provide answers to questions asked by prospective sources and to extend the date for responses to this RFQ.

Question:  Please clarify that the Government is needing a KU only capable antenna.

Answer:  Yes, KU only.

Question:  Does the Government really desire two each waveguide kits?

Answer:  Yes, the Government wants two kits.  The Government has an existing KU band dish that we want to outfit with quick disconnects.

Question:  Vertex manufactures two type of waveguid kit.  One to provide for waveguide hook of the feed TX port down to a boom mounted RFT, the second extends the waveguide run to the edge of the reflector and then includes a section of twist-flex W/G to extend this to an equipment case on the ground.  Which waveguide kit do you need?  In either case, is the second kit a spare for the first, or do you want to extend the RX port beyond the feed - if so, where to?

Answer:  The Government desires the second waveguide kit described above which extends the waveguide run to the end of the reflector and then includes a section of twist flex W/G to extend to an equipment case on the ground.  

Question:  What is the nominal length of the 2 each waveguide kits required or are you looking to procure only the quick-release flanges to mate with the 2.4m Flyaway and your existing WR75 waveguide?

Answer:  The information provided in the question/answer preceding this question/answer should answer this particular question.  

Question:  Is the quick disconnect waveguide for a boom mounted HPA or should it go to the end of the feed boom for a rack mounted (in a case) HPA?  

Answer:  It should got the end of the feed boom for a rack mounted HPA.

The date and time for receipt of responses to this solicitation is extended to March 15, 2002 (Friday) at 10:00 AM EST.

A ? REQUIREMENT
THIS IS A RE-SOLICITATION OF A PREVIOUS HBCU/MI SET-ASIDE ANNOUNCEMENT.  In an effort to obtain more depth and breadth within the topic areas white papers are now being solicited from non-HBCU/MI universities and from industry on a non-fee-bearing basis as well as any HBCU/MI who may have missed the first announcement.  All white papers will be evaluated according to the evaluation criteria of this announcement and all other terms remain unchanged.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) requests proposals for University-based Laser Technologies for Information and Materials Advancement (ULTIMA). The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Phillips Research Site (PRS), Directed Energy Directorate (DEBS), Kirtland AFB, NM solicits proposals to develop research in advanced laser, electro-optical technologies, observatory instrumentation and applications, and potential dual-use scientific research that enhances AFRL, Air Force, DoD or National Scientific programs and requirements. The ULTIMA program is especially interested in pushing the state of the art in the following technical areas:

1.  Laser Research.  Research, analysis, development, and demonstration of technologies associated with laser sensing for applications such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), imaging, remote sensing, detection, and laser communications.  Development of hardware and software such as eye-safe lasers for commercial and military applications, high-speed or high?resolution/fidelity sensors, wavefront control, pointing and tracking, ultra-lightweight mirrors or collectors, imaging algorithms, and discrimination algorithms.  Concept and system operation developments for activities such as UAV or satellite-based laser sensing, active and passive satellite sensing and imaging (including geo-synchronous satellite imaging), and space-based relay mirror concepts, applications and technologies.

2.  Observatory Potential Dual-Use Exploitation.  Development of new areas of research, experimentation and instrumentation to augment national caliber observatories and facilities such as Magdelena Ridge Observatory, White Sands Missile Range, Apache Point/Sunspot, and Geo Light Imaging National Testbed (GLINT). Besides these particular facilities, this area includes proposals of field measurements at these or other proposed facilities as appropriate. This technology area also includes any ideas in instrumentation for general telescope facilities, whether it be for technology demonstration, observatory control, science measurements, or data analysis.

<CONTACT>Carol A. White, 303-445-6345 (fax)
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with National Environmental Sciences, Inc., 23 Mountaire Court, Clayton, California, to acquire the services of a taxonomic expert that will assist Reclamation in the separation and identification of larval and post-larval fish found in daily fish salvage activities at the Tracy Fish Collection Facility and Red Bluff Experimental Research Pumping Plant, California. The taxonomic expert will also examine and quantify external damage found in the fish samples as part of this endeavor, and additionally, will provide on-site fish taxonomic training to Tracy and Red Bluff staff.  Expertise required for this effort includes the ability to identify and differentiate over 130 species found in the Sacramento River at Red Bluff and the San Francisco Bay/Delta area, and most importantly, the identification and separation of the endangered Delta smelt from a non-endangered closely related species.  Because of the extreme difficulty in separating these two closely related species for the purposes of quantifying take limits, it is essential that the selected taxonomic expert be a nationally recognized expert in fish taxonomic efforts, with critical expertise in larval identification and differentiation between the two species of specific concern, and the other species found within the Sacramento River and the San Francisco Bay/Delta.  The taxonomic expert must be one that is determined capable of performing the separating task, and is acceptable to overseeing government regulatory agencies. The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services that will satisfy the agency requirements.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms that believe they can provide similar required services are encouraged to iden written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Firms believing they can provide similar required services must provide conclusive supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated critical requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received from date of publication of this synopsis and intended award will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by FAX at (303) 445-6345, Attention: White.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710 which is 500 employees.

<DESC>The U.S. Border Patrol is actively seeking information and solutions to improve its unattended ground sensor (UGS) program.  Information is requested to evaluate current and new technologies that may be used to improve or replace the present system for future nationwide deployments.  The Border Patrol has been using UGS systems since the early 1970s as a means to detect illegal entries into the United States.  Many thousands of these devices have been deployed and are in use along the Country's borders.  In order to maintain compatibility with existing equipment, the Border Patrol has kept with 25-year-old standards and specifications.  These restrictive specifications have hindered the introduction of new technologies or innovations.  In order to encourage new technology proposals, backward compatibility will no longer be mandatory.  A typical UGS system as deployed by the Border Patrol consists of a detector/transmitter, a repeater, a receiver, and a computerized reporting system.  The detector/transmitter classifies movement and direction of persons and vehicles and reports via wireless means to a distant location.  The devices are required to be concealed from intruders and the general public and are therefore usually buried.  The devices are required to operate for long periods of time without maintenance.  At present, these devices are buried for periods up to and exceeding one (1) year before battery replacement is necessary.  Detection technologies currently employed use seismic, passive infrared and magnetic phenomenologies.  Distances between the detector/transmitter and receiver can be hundreds of miles with intervening mountains.  Repeaters are used to overcome the problems caused by these distances and obstructions.  The receivers are usually located at a Headquarters facility and sometimes at sub-office locations.  Portable receivers are often used to assist in the installation of devices or for local monitoring purposes.  Typically, the receivers located at the Headquarters facility connect to a dispatch reporting system that displays alarm information on a computer monitor.  GUIDELINES:  Offerors should use, but not be restricted by, the following guidelines for their proposals.  The use of new concepts and technologies is encouraged.  The Border Patrol wishes to detect and identify persons walking both singly or in groups, and land vehicles such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles.  Direction information is desired.  Watercraft detection capabilities will also be considered.  Currently, seismic, passive infrared and magnetic phenomenologies are used to detect intrusions.  Other detection methods and techniques are encouraged.  Because of the nature of the operation, the ability to deploy these units in a covert manner is essential.  For most installations, burying is the preferred method.  The devices are required to operate for long periods of time without maintenance.   In areas of extreme cold, it is not possible to access these devices because the ground is frozen for several months out of the year.  Since the devices are intended for use throughout both northern and southern borders, they must be designed to resist the severe elemental extremes of these locations.  The devices are typically exposed to extreme heat, cold, moisture, alkaline and acidic soils, insects and animals.  Alarm reporting shall be accomplished using wireless techniques.  New and emerging technologies, effective utilization of transmitter power, modulation techniques, size and weight are critical design parameters.  Resistance to jamming, interference, and interception are very important considerations.  When reporting an alarm, each device must be capable of being uniquely identified within a nationwide system and should have the ability to report operating parameters of the device.  Because of the hundreds of miles that some of the reporting signals must travel, repeaters are often used.  Often these repeaters are located in developed sites with available commercial power.  Some are located in remote unprotected locations and must be concealed and powered by alternate power sources.  The present system receiver communicates the sensor information via a serial communications port to an in-house dispatching system where it is correlated with a database for identification and statistical alarm reporting.  The computerized dispatch system is a proprietary system developed and maintained by the Border Patrol and is not part of this inquiry.  Use of commercial off the shelf (COTS) products are encouraged whenever possible.  Responses should be detailed enough to illustrate the operational feasibility of the sensor system to include intrusion detection and transmission methods to a monitoring location.  Responses should also indicate an existing ability to manufacture a fully functional system for evaluation. 
Responses to this request for information are not offers and cannot be accepted to form a binding contract.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.

<DESC>This sources sought/market survey synopsis is being conducted for the ROES training package development at the Department of Veterans Affairs Denver Distribution Center.     ROES v3 is a software application providing order entry and related functionality to VA Denver Distribution Center (DDC) customers.  The DDC's chief customers are medical clinicians in the audiology and prosthetics professions.  The application is primarily web-based, but also includes some client/server components.  The application consists of several separate, but related functional modules. Implementation of ROES v3 will be accompanied by delivery of a training package, providing instruction to end users on the proper usage of the application.  The package must be designed around online delivery, i.e., the package must be capable of residing on either a web site or removable media such as CD-ROM. The ideal training package will include the following features/capabilities: 	Combined and synchronized audio-visual presentation, utilizing visual computer screen representations of the application, animation simulating end user tasks, and audible narration/instruction accompanying the on-screen presentation. 	Interactive interfacing, allowing the end user to practice appropriate data entry and be presented with resulting actions, also allowing for self-paced progression through the training. 	Context-sensitive help, allowing the end user to gather information about all significant on-screen application components. 	Integrated testing/knowledge evaluation functionality, allowing for verification that the end user saw and understood the major concepts presented during the training. 	Course completion tracking by individual, allowing for identification of an individual and confirmation that that individual completed the training, including the ability to pass that information externally for integration into database systems. 	Progress tracking functionality, allowing an end user to leave the package and return to the same point at a later time. The DDC is assembling a list of potential sources for outsourcing the development of this end user training package.  Commercial sources possessing the expertise, resources, and ability to develop such a package should provide the following materials to the DDC: 	Description of the business/company, including corporate background and corporate mission and philosophy.

<DESC>Battelle is contemplating issuing an RFP for a single vendor to provide fabricated metal devices.  Under a Non-Disclosure Agreement, selected vendor would use design specifications to fabricate all-titanium or titanium alloy devices.  The devices are laminated structures consisting of numerous components bonded into a single unit with multiple internal hermetically isolated regions.  The bonded area of a device < 40 in2 (260 cm2) and the maximum dimension is < 7.25 in (18.5 cm), projected as a circle.  Requires expertise in conventional machining, including boring, tapping, milling, and surface grinding, of titanium to high tolerances (e.g., surface grinding to 0.0005-in. flatness and parallelism, and a 16-?in. surface finish).  Also requires expertise in photochemical machining of titanium stock in precise patterns and etch depths, and diffusion bonding of laminates to produce a hermetic device.  Inert-atmosphere titanium-titanium welding and/or titanium-stainless steel bonding may be necessary to complete fabrication.  Interested parties should fax a brief statement of capabilities outlining past experience in these fields of fabrication to the Point of Contact at the number listed below.

<SUBJECT>Investigating Remediation Alternatives for Low-Level Radioactive Mill Tailings
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is currently investigating alternatives for containing or removing the 11.9 million tons of low-level radioactively contaminated mill tailings at the former Atlas mill site in Moab, Utah. The former Atlas Site encompasses 400 acres and is situated on the banks of the Colorado River.  The DOE is primarily focused on two remediation alternatives: cap-in-place or relocation of the tailings for off-site disposal.  The DOE has not yet determined the approach it will take nor has it developed a firm requirement or specification for executing this project.  When that occurs, DOE will initiate the appropriate procurement action to solicit proposals for performing the work.  Continuation of this project is subject to the development of an acceptable remediation plan and Congressional appropriation of funding. If you have constructive ideas regarding this project, and wish to share them with the DOE during this investigative stage, you are welcome to do so. DOE is only interested in proven technologies.  Be advised that your ideas, suggestions, or proposals regarding this project will be considered by DOE to be entirely unsolicited.  Accordingly, the DOE makes no promises or commitments to pay or reimburse you for any costs associated with the development or presentation of the material furnished to us or to award you, either now or in the future, a contract for any work associated with this project.  The DOE will not return any materials furnished in response to this notice.

The solicitation, when issued, will seek proposals to implement USAID/Ugandas Strengthening Support Systems activity, which will focus on increasing the capacity of national level support systems to sustain social sector service delivery in an improved enabling environment.  The activity will help to sustain and reinforce the necessary conditions for improved health, longer and more productive life, greater access to employment opportunities, and increased productivity by addressing the key problems of: high fertility, morbidity and mortality, rapid population growth, illiteracy, poor educational performance, and declining educational quality.  The activity will be implemented through a cost reimbursement contract for a period of five years.  The Draft RFP will be posted through March 15, 2002.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Security Risk Assessment Methodology for Water Utilities - Train the Trainer
<DESC>Training Available
Sandia National Laboratories
Security Risk Assessment Methodology for Water Utilities
Train-the-Trainer

Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) under an agreement with the Awwa Research Foundation developed and delivered a course to train water utilities, water utility consultants, security consultants, and other affected parties on the Risk Assessment Methodology for Water Utilities (RAM-WSM).  The demand for the course has been overwhelming.  Therefore, in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Sandia is developing a train-the-trainer version of the course to allow other professional trainers to begin offering this course throughout the United States.  The 4-day train-the-trainer course will be offered a total of 2 times, at Sandia's facilities in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at the end of April and early in May, 2002.  There will be space for a total of 64 individuals between the two courses.  Each entity desiring to receive this training and certification to train others will be limited to 4 trainers.  Space (4 individuals out of the 64 available) is being reserved for a not-for-profit entity.  There may be more than 4 slots available for not-for-profits, but a minimum of 4 will be reserved.

The goal of the program is to provide certified trainers that will be available to consultants, water utilities, and government/tribal entities to support the EPA's objective to have vulnerability assessments conducted at water utilities.  To attain EPA's goal, all certified trainers will be required to publicly provide this training course a minimum number of times.  Details are contained below.

Proposals are being sought from qualified firms that meet the Selection Criteria listed in the next section.  The proposals will be evaluated by a review panel, representing regulators, water utilities, water utility associations, and Sandia personnel.  Details on the required criteria, desired criteria, and the proposal requirements are contained below.  At the end of the course, each trainer who has successfully met the course requirements, will be offered a license to use the course materials to train others.

A fee of  $1,000 per person will be charged to each trainer, excluding not-for-profits, to attend the course.  The target audience for courses subsequently offered by the certified trainers will be comprised of the following groups:

1.	Technical consultants offering vulnerability assessment (assessors) support to the water industry.
2.	Water utility staff and management desiring to complete their own assessments.
3.	State, local, EPA, tribal and other regulatory staff.  Instructors will be taught how to abbreviate the materials to cover the salient points of the course for this audience.

Selection Criteria:

Required Criteria (100 points total)

1.	Experience in conducting professional development courses targeted at audiences of  management, experienced engineers, scientists, technicians, and related professional disciplines.  Criteria to be evaluated will include the number and type of courses offered, training of the instructors, and feedback from course participants. (40 points)
2.	Knowledge and experience with industrial security.  Criteria to be evaluated will include security training, security design and/or installation, and written recommendations or references from clients for which security services were provided.  Reputation and experience of company with respect to integrity and proven assurance that the sensitive information making up the course content will be properly secured.  (30 points)
3.	Knowledge of and familiarity with drinking water and wastewater utilities.  Criteria to be evaluated include experience with training, design and/or construction, formal training of the instructors, and feedback from course participants. (30 points)




Desired Criteria (6 bonus points)

1.	Experience with risk analysis to include security upgrades and mitigation.  Criteria to be evaluated include formal training, and/or completion of risk analyses. (2 points) 
2.	Experience with security technologies.  Criteria to be evaluated include design and/or installation of security hardware and/or formal training. (2 points)
3.	Number of professional trainers available.  Criteria to be evaluated include the number of staff available that have been engaged, part or full time, in providing professional training. (2 points)

Protection of the course materials and course content

Firms chosen to attend this course must agree to maintain the integrity and security of the course materials in accordance with the course distribution agreement.  All future attendees of any course taught by the certified trainers must sign a Nondisclosure Agreement so that security information can be shared with relevant stakeholders, but not be generally available in the public domain.   Additionally, employment of all course attendees with a reputable water utility, consultant, or other entity must be verified.

Course Dates

The course will be offered April 29 - May 2, and May 28-31.  These are the only two dates that are available to receive this training.  Preferences for which course to attend will be considered, but trainers from all firms responding to this solicitation must be available on both dates.
Course Offerings

All successful firms/trainers receiving this training will be required to publicly (open to target audiences mentioned earlier) offer the course a minimum of 2 times in the 3 months following the training.  

The train-the-trainer course will have a test-out section to certify that the participants understand the material and can convey it to others.  The primary intent of offering the train-the-trainer program is to train the water industry on the security risk assessment methodology.

To ensure the on-going quality of the course, Sandia will require that all course offerings by the certified trainers include written feedback that will be reviewed by Sandia.  Sandia trainers will also randomly attend the courses offered by the certified trainers to provide feedback to the trainers.  Certified trainers are allowed and encouraged to provide training internal to their respective companies.  All the same requirements apply. 

Licensing Fees

The materials for this course are licensed through Sandia to the firms/trainers that successfully complete the train-the-trainer course.  The materials are copyrighted by Sandia and can only be distributed in accordance with the license agreement.

Each attendee at a course subsequently offered by one of the certified trainers will be charged a fee of $20 to receive the copyrighted materials.  How much each attendee is charged (in addition to the licensing fee) to receive this training from certified trainers is solely at the discretion of the certified trainer and their respective firms.
