<DESC>The U.S. Army Engineer District, Alaska (POA) intends to include sole source specifications for the aircraft hangar doors in the FY05 Aircraft Maintenance Hangar (AMH) (Army Project Number 41753) at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, under the Multiple Award T ask Order Contract (MATOC).  The only system known to meet the required specifications is the Megadoor Vertical-lift Fabric Project Doors (System 1500).  Sole source determination is based upon the need for aircraft hangar doors that open vertically, are insulated and resist infiltration, and are made up of multiple sections, operated either individually or in groups.  The overall hangar opening, with all doors open, will be approximately 225 feet wide by 36 feet tall.  The opening will have up to three (3) separate door sections with swing-up intermediate mullions.  Vertical opening doors do not require lateral door pockets and eliminates the rails and/or floor tracks required with sliding doors.  Double-fabric doors with horizontal stiffeners provide structural resistence to wind loading, resistence to infiltration,  and provide thermal performance to approximately R-3.  A series of multiple doors with swing-up mullions will provide the user with the most flexibility in housing a variety of aircraft sizes and configurations while limiting exposure of the hangar bay to  the elements. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the descretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether  to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by 15 June 2005 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Surveillance Branch, currently has an immediate requirement for 88 each Megabucket Assembly Units (MAU) for a required modification to replace the existing Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE-3) Transmitter/Receivers (T/R's) Minibucket, Microbucket, Maxibucket, and Power Supply to address obsolescence and supportability issues for all ASDE-3 radar systems.  An MAU is required to replace the functionality in the minibucket, microbucket, and certain fuctionality in the maxibucket and the system power supply.  The MAU must be a system uniquely designed to interface to the existing ASDE-3 T/R unit, and must also be able to interface to the ASDE-3 Radar Video Processor, Remote Monitoring Subsystem Interface (RMSi) computer, an RS232 device server and an ASDE-3X Radar Data Processor.  The standard for this replacement is high and the FAA must ensure confidence in the selected vendor's ability to meet the design's requirements.! Tracewell Systems is currently the only known source for the MAU because they have a COTS MAU assembly that can meet the FAA's requirements.  Their system meets the FAA's electrical and mechanical specifications within the existing space allowed by the removal of the ASDE-3 equipment.  The FAA will not have to redesign the ASDE-3 T/R to accept Tracewell System's MAU and will be able to deploy this modification to the field to avoid operational shutdown due to supportability issues. To receive consideration as a potential source, any other concern must provide in writing a description of their MAU and demonstrate how it will function with the existing ASDE-3 radar systems. Vendors must respond in writing to the Contracting Officer identified in this market survey.  Mark responses to the survey with market survey number #38-01837, to arrive by June 8, 2005.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire this equipment.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on this initial submittal.  The final determination by the FAA not to open thie requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Surveillance Branch, has an immediate requirement for 73 each Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE-3) Radar Video Processing System.  The ASDE-3 service life extension program (SLEP) has an initiative to replace the transmitter/receivers (T/R's) Radar Video Processing (RVP) boards with a PC based RVP that performs the same functions of the existing ASDE-3 RVP boards. These RVP boards are only known to be available from Primagraphics because they currently have a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) PC based RVP solution with both the radar input and output cards.  The RVP must be able to reside in the existing space allowed by the removal of the ASDE-3 equipment and meet the FAA's electrical and mechanical specifications.  Primagraphics COTS solution meets these requirements and thus will preclude the FAA need to redesign the ASDE-3 T/R to accept a differenct design approach for the RVP. To receive consideration as a potential source, any other concern must provide in writing a description of their RVP board and demonstrate how it will function with the existing ASDE-3 RVP system. Vendors must respond in writing to the Contracting Officer identified in this market survey.  Mark responses to the survey with market survey number #38-01848, to arrive by June 8, 2005.

Description:  F110-GE-129 Anti-Icing Valve is approximately 8-inch cube with a 2-inch diameter tube 30 inches long attached to valve at center of the tube.  The Anti-Icing Valve is pressure-activated solenoid, regulator/shutoff valve that regulates the bleeding of compressed engine air. The Anti-Icing Valve is an electro-pneumatic device.  The valve has two modes; closed and regulating.  When an electrical signal is received from the aircraft, ice sensors or a manual switch in the cockpit, the Anti-Icing Valve switches to the regulating mode, open and regulates the flow of warm air to the engine inlet.  In the regulating mode, the valve modulates as necessary to maintain a given outlet pressure to the front frame of the engine based on the inlet pressure from the bleed air system.  Additionally, when the valve is in the regulating mode, the pressure switch provides an electrical signal to the cockpit to indicate the valve is operating.

These qualification requirements apply to line item(s) 0001 through 0002.  Approved Source is Whittaker Control Division, North Hollywood, CA.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with the only qualified source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has an on-going requirement for the purchase of high-density oligonucleotide microarrays and NPPOC chemical reagents (proprietary nucleotide chemicals) for their synthesis to be used in the Genome Research Facility at NASA Ames Research Center. NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from NimbleGen Systems, Inc. of Madison, WI 53711, under the authority of FAR Part 13.501(a), for the acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  The arrays are required to be used with the Ames lab’s NimbleGen Maskless Array Synthesizer (MAS) System, thus the arrays must be compatible with the existing array synthesis system. The synthesis apparatus is custom designed to accommodate only NimbleGen microarrays.	The specifications of the oligonucleotide arrays are: (1) Individual size = 16 microns square; (2) 400,000 custom sequences per array as specified by NASA with an unlimited number of custom design formats; (3)	Each array will be manufactured on a 1” x 3” glass slide; (4) The contractor will perform hybridization, scan, and preliminary analysis of results for each array. Background: In September 2002, NASA Ames publicized a sole source requirement for the purchase of a NimbleGen MAS System and oligonucleotide arrays.  Based on previous purchases, we anticipate requiring approximately 200 arrays per year. Deliverables: The contractor will provide high density oligonucleotid arrays, customized by NASA Ames, on an as-needed basis.	 Period of Performance: NASA Ames intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement with NimbleGen Systems, Inc. to provide the arrays as described above.  The period of performance shall be five years.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 13, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>NATALIA FISHER-JACKSON, Contract Specialist, Phone: (919) 541-3564 , E-Mail: fisher-jackson.natalia@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with The Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals, Northern Arizona State University, P.O. Box 15004, Flagstaff, AZ 86011-5004.  The contractor will provide the following services: Task 1.  Develop and Implement TEISS Web Course. The contractor shall develop a web-course on emission inventory (EI) general concepts, techniques and the use of the TEISS to conduct an EI for reservation lands.  The web-course, open to 20 participants, shall be taught twice during the project period.  The contractor shall revise the web-course based on input from the participants of the two classes.  The web-course materials and staff to answer questions and provide guidance shall remain accessible throughout the year. Task 2.  Develop data management tools and documentation.  Most tribes are using Excel tables as their default data storage formats, and use a variety of methods for transferring their data into their files.  Tribes are in need of guidance and mechanisms to conduct data entry validation (double-key programs), range checks and automatic flag assignments, formatting data for EPA?s Air Quality System (AQS) entry, consistently and accurately importing data from outside sources such as the National Weather Service (NWS) and analysis laboratories, and data reporting.  Furthermore, the development of a consistent approach to data storage and formatting would allow simpler communication and data exchange. ITEP has developed Excel spreadsheets for each criteria pollutant, and blank Access databases for both filter  (data-received-from-lab)-based and continuous (data-downloaded-from-analyzer)-based instrument systems, with associated procedures and tutorials.  However, additional work is necessary to make these templates useful to the tribes.  The contractor shall perform a thorough review and testing of the previously developed data management spreadsheets, macros, and databases, and make technical revisions to these templates to make them more user friendly and to ensure accuracy.  In addition, the contractor shall develop detailed user?s manuals that include practical examples for both the Excel and Access templates.   Task 3.  Develop data mapping tool documentation.  Maps provide a visual description of the data that is invaluable for tribal air departments who need to convey information to their tribal leaders and community members for whom English may be a second language and tables of numbers not useful.  While tribal environmental offices may obtain GIS systems, staff time is so limited that the learning curve for mapping software tools can be insurmountable.  Assistance with mapping air quality data using inexpensive, easy-to-use systems is urgently needed.  NAU/ITEP and tribal instructors have assembled a tutorial on using ArcView 8.3, but this tutorial needs additional work to be useful to the tribes.  The contractor shall review and test the ArcView tutorial and make technical as well as editorial revisions to ensure that the guidance is technically accurate and appropriately documented for the novice user of the software.   Task 4.  Develop data analysis and quality control tools and documentation.  It is important that tribal air offices understand the implications of the results of ambient air quality monitoring and be able to convey that information to their tribal governments  prior to releasing the data to the public.  Tribes often use outside consultants and contractors for data verification and validation functions.  As a result, tribes are often not as confident as they could be in the quality of their data, and therefore do not report and otherwise make use of the data to the full extent possible.   Using the previously developed template spreadsheets and database structures as a starting point, the contractor shall design spreadsheets and other protocols for data analysis, for estimating precision based on collocated sites or span checks, and for estimating accuracy based on external and internal audits.   These spreadsheets shall be automated templates for control charts that allow the visual display of quality control information.  In addition, the contractor shall provide thorough and accurate documentation of the templates in the form of user?s guides that include example applications of the tools.  Task 5.  Develop data reporting tools and documentation.  Tribal ambient air quality data is not as disseminated as widely as data from other sources. EPA?s Air Quality Subsystem (AQS) is not specifically tailored for tribal data submission, and the AQS help desks and personnel are not familiar with setting up data entry systems for tribes.  The contractor shall develop and document simple stand-alone modules that operate in Microsoft Access that write text files formatted for AQS data entry/reporting for validated data. In addition, the contractor shall develop user?s guides for these reporting modules that include step-by-step instructions in their use and practical examples illustrating their application.  EPA believes that the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals is the only vendor capable of satisfying the Agency's requirements. The circumstances permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements."  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exists and, therefore, no RFP is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide a capability statement but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will not be honored.  All interested parties must respond by June 15, 2005 @ 2:00 P.M. to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attn: Natalia Fisher-Jackson, RTP Procurement Operations Division (D143-01), 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC 27703.   Interested vendors shall:  1) include information on the proposed services which clearly supports the requirements outlined above; 2) fully explain your capabilities and qualifications and; 3) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  Response to this synopsis must be made in writing.    No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.     ndors shall:  1) include information on the proposed services which clearly supports the requirements outlined above; 2) fully explain your capabilities and qualifications and;  3) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  Response to this synopsis must be made in writing.  No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, 
Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Jurabek Nurmahmatovich Nurmahmatov, Minister of Energy, Tajikistan Ministry of Energy, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA  22209, Attention:  Tajikistan Rehabilitation of the Kairakkum and Varzob Cascade Hydropower Projects Feasibility Study. The Ministry of Energy of Tajikistan (“Grantee”) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for rehabilitation of the Kairakkum and Varzob Cascade hydropower projects.

Two hydropower projects owned by Barqi Tojik are in need of rehabilitation, the Kairakkum and Varzob Cascade hydropower projects.  The Kairakkum 126 MW hydropower project in Northern Tajikistan was commissioned in 1957 and is the primary source of electrical production in Northern Tajikistan. Rehabilitation would serve to make the units more efficient and to increase their reliability.  Rehabilitation is considered of the highest priority for the Ministry because of the dilapidated condition of the equipment and the lack of other domestic sources of electricity for Northern Tajikistan.  By replacing the existing Russian-built turbines with higher efficiency turbines with a greater output, total annual electricity production at the plant is expected to increase from 629 Gigawatt hours (GWh) to 888 GWh.  

The Varzob Hydroelectric Cascade is a series of three hydroelectric plants on one stretch of the Varzob River in central Tajikistan.  The project is an important source of power for Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, as it is located close to Dushanbe.  One of the hydropower plants has been mothballed due to the old technology and poor condition of the equipment at the plant.  The remaining two hydropower plants require new turbines, transformers and other equipment.  The rehabilitation is needed to keep the two plants working although no increase in generation is expected.

The overall objective of the Feasibility Study is to establish the technical, commercial and financial feasibility of rehabilitations of the Kairakkum and Varzob Cascade Hydropower projects.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $415,850 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English to the Grantee c/o USTDA by 4:00 PM, July 1, 2005 at the above address or by email to the address specified in the RFP.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires an electron beam lithography system for the NIST Advanced Measurement Laboratory (AML) Nanofab.  The e-beam lithography system is to be used for both direct write lithography and mask writing. 

The Contractor is responsible for supplying the lithography system as well as any vibration, acoustic, and electromagnetic isolation required to meet the technical specifications.  

The NIST AML Nanofab will be operated as a shared access user facility.  This means that the staff of NIST and its partners, subject to provisions, training, and user fees, will be permitted to independently operate much of the equipment.  

The e-beam lithography tool being procured will likely have only two certified operators.  The tools will be operated in a manner such that a wide variety of materials can be processed.  The facility will be directed by NIST’s Semiconductor Electronics Division. Unlike other Nanofabs, the NIST AML Nanofab is unique in that it is located next to the most advanced metrology tools in the world, and its focus will be on fabricating nanoscale structures necessary for metrology and standards in support of the semiconductor industry, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and homeland security.  

This requirement is being procured using Simplified Acquisition 
Procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items via full & open competition.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number 
SB1341-05-Q-0673.

The RFQ is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about June 7, 2005, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant purchase order.   No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

THE DUE DATE FOR QUOTATIONS SHALL BE IDENTIFIED IN THE SOLICITATION.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole-source acquisition with the International Social Security Association (ISSA) of Geneva, Switzerland with the intention of awarding a contract for the services described in this announcement. SSA has a need for research and dissemination of information on international social security programs. Experience and developments in social security programs maintained by other nations are analyzed by SSA and related to SSA program and policy deliberations. Executives within SSA use this information, as do other executive agencies, the Congress, researchers and the public. This activity generates the standard reference document, Social Security Programs Throughout the World (SSPTW).  SSPTW is an internationally respected publication which has been produced by the Social Security Administration since 1937. A continuous flow of accurate and reliable data on international programs is critical to this program effort.  This requirement calls for the contractor to collect information on social security programs in approximately 172 countries, analyze the data, and produce four separate volumes of SSPTW.  This requirement also calls for the contractor to update the CD-ROM databases that include providing searchable, linkable electronic versions of available social security laws; information on recent developments in social security; and the full text of  SSPTW. The contractor will be required to obtain and provide translations and any other support services necessary to the successful conduct and completion of the project. The CD-ROM will be available in four languages: English, French, Spanish and German.  The ISSA possesses unique qualifications and capabilities in the social security field to meet the project requirements and successfully carry out its objectives.  For the past 2 decades the ISSA has collected information on social security developments and trends worldwide. The ISSA has proprietary control of the information it collects for both SSPTW and the CD-ROM (data in the CD-ROM's  legislative database, NATLEX, is provided by special agreement with International Labor Office.)  The ISSA regularly produces a number of social security publications on related topics.  The ISSA specializes in social security and has unique and long-established contacts. The ISSA’s affiliate members in 139 countries, as well as associate members in 40 countries with whom it has established working relationships, support the Association’s aims: the protection, promotion, and development of social security throughout the world.  In addition, the ISSA has contacts with about 47 non-member countries for the purpose of obtaining social security program information.  Furthermore, the ISSA, which had been in operation since 1927, provides a symposium for the international exchange of information in all areas of social security as broadly defined. The ISSA is a nonpolitical international organization. U.S. agency conduct of this project would preclude access to otherwise obtainable information from certain countries.  The ISSA has the capability and support services such as expert staff, physical facilities and translation capabilities, as well as social security contacts mentioned above, to ensure the systematic and consistent flow of materials required to effectively conduct this project.  The proposed contract is a fixed-priced term contract, with options for additional services.  Any organization that believes that it has the capability to perform this work may submit a statement of such capability.  This is not a request for proposal.  The cost for the preparation and submission of proposals will not be reimbursed by the Government. The size limitation for email attachments is five megabytes per individual email message.  Responses to this notice should be submitted by June 8, 2005, 3:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time. Respondents will not be notified of the results of an evaluation of the information received.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>General Information Document Type:	Special Notice	 Posted Date:		June 1, 2005 Naics Code:		519910  All Other Information Services Contracting Office Address US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, ATTN: MCMR-AAA, 820 Chandler Street, Frederick, MD 21702-5014 Description The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a sole source delivery order to U.S. Pharmacopeia, 12601 Twinbrook Parkway, Rockville, MD 20852. The procurement is to training support of the MEDMARX medication and pharmacy erro r reporting system to meet Military Health System (MHS) requirements and support Patient Safety.  The MHS has acquired the MEDMARX® Medication and Pharmacy Error Reporting System for use in all MHS facilities for medication event reporting.  MEDMARX® provides the MHS with aggregated, de-identified information on medication management in the MHS from da ta gathered on a by-event basis in the military treatment facilities (MTFs) of the Department of Defense healthcare system that is used in the patient safety reporting processes directed by the TMA Patient Safety Program (PSP) under the direction of the TM A Office of the Chief Medical Officer. The MHS Patient Safety Center uses the data reported from the MEDMARX® to conduct studies on MHS performance, map trends, and recommend areas for concentration of effort in medication management based on the informati on derived from the MEDMARX®.   The MHS is required to provide advanced user training in the use of the MEDMARX® application on a continuing basis in the MHS at both the MTF level and in concentrated Patient Safety classes conducted on a quarterly basis.  In addition, the Patient Safety Center requires the provision of a monthly data set containing the most recent MHS data in MEDMARX® so that it can conduct its own analysis and reporting of information back to the MHS and the Services. The subject acquisition supports RITPO and MHS standards based initiatives by providing training and database support to a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software framework that was procured earlier on contract DASW01-03-P-0737.   This software is compatible with the existing RITPO enterprise architecture and consistent with current targets for the overall MHS enterprise architecture direction, therefore training and database support must be continued to support this solution.   Any firm that believes that it can provide the stated capability within the established timeframe are invited to submit written notification to the Contract Specialist within fifteen calendar days from the date of publication of this notice. Supporting evi dence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firms ability. Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist at: herbert.payne@amedd.army.mil. Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the government not to com pete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.  Email your questions to US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity at herbert.payne@amedd.army.mil.

<DESC>This program addresses current shortfalls in information integration resulting from limitations in technology and uncertainty/imprecision of data and information. The Program seeks to develop hardware and software technologies that (1) identify and integrate informational content from multiple information sources; (2) integrate the massive amounts of information; and (3) provide automatic correlation, fusion, and insight to support user-cognitive processes. Particular emphasis will be placed on automating the association of objects and events in the battlespace and automatically transforming this information into actionable knowledge (e.g., indications and warnings of intent).  

In current and future operational environments such as Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), warfighters require technologies evolved to support information needs regardless of location and consistent with the user’s level of command or responsibility and operational situation. To support this need, the DOD has developed the concept of Network Centric Warfare (NCW). The Chief of Naval Research (CNO) defines NCW as “military operations that exploit state-of-the-art information and networking technology to integrate widely dispersed human decision makers, situational and targeting sensors, and forces and weapons into a highly adaptive, comprehensive system to achieve unprecedented mission effectiveness.” 

Net-centric operations include communications and information assurance capabilities to enable all-source data access, multi-source processing, and tailored dissemination to Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) users across the network. The operational benefits sought are an increased speed, accuracy and precision of command; distributed self-synchronization; flexibility and adaptability to an operational situation; and decision superiority. To accomplish this, it must be possible to automate understanding of the battlespace by identifying objects, determining relationships among the objects, assessing intent, and automatically generating courses of action with associated risks and uncertainty.

d.	Schedule Plan

From these schedules, the CMc will give their input.  The CMc will verify estimating services the A-E provides.

Question:	Who controls A-E Submissions & Level of Submissions?  Who keeps the Design & Scope on schedule?

Response:	CMc is responsible to keep the schedule on-track.  The ultimate responsibility if the scope/schedule should slip will be that of GSA.  However, the CMc will be responsible to provide recommendations/concerns regarding the scope & schedule and report them in a timely manner to GSA.  GSA will enforce the A-E to act and proceed according to schedule.

Question:	Will the CMc do their own cost estimate or will they verify that of the A-E’s?

Response:	The CMc will analyze and verify the A/E’s cost estimate. The cost estimate must not exceed the project’s budget.

Question:	Will the CMc work with the A-E regarding the schedule and phasing of the project?

Response:	Yes, it will be a collaborative effort of all parties.

Question:	How will scope be controlled?  What about “Tenant Improvement” work?

Response:	Scope will be developed during the Concept Stage.  The CMc will be participating in this stage to help define the scope so that changes will be minimized as the project progresses.  There is no tenant improvement work currently included in the scope; however, such work may arise as the project progresses.

Question:	What is the contingency for the project?

Response:	 GSA will have a small contingency during the Design & Construction Phases; however, the CMc SHOULD NOT RELY ON THESE FUNDS BECAUSE THE A/E AND THE CMc WILL BE SELECTED ON DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE CRITERIA.

Question:	The CMc will have a higher confidence level should the A-E provide the level of detail needed.  However, what happens if unforeseen site conditions arise?

Response:	GSA WILL NOT request funds for escalation. The Budget must be met.

Question:	Is the ECCA closer to $30 million or $40 million.

Response:  Addressed in the RFP. The Estimate Construction Cost at Award is $36,000.000.

Question:	Will the four (4) Partnering Meetings be held in Washington D.C. or Indianapolis?

Response:	Partnering Sessions will be held in Indianapolis so that tenants can attend.

Question:	Commissioning Services- where do they start/end in regards to the CMc’s own commissioning services?

Response:	Panos Giannakopouls reads an excerpt from the draft RFP for 3rd Party Commissioning. 
•	The Commissioning Plan shall be provided by the Commissioning Agency
•	The Commissioning Agency shall conduct a focused review of te design prior to the construction document phase to ensure that each commissioned feature of system meets the owner’s requirements relative to functionality, energy performance, maintainability, system cost, indoor environmental quality, and local environmental impacts.
•	The Commissioning Authority must sufficiently observe installation of each type of commissioned feature to ensure that they are properly installed according to the contract documents and manufacturer’s instructions, and that other building components are not compromising the performance of the feature.
•	After the contractor completes the start-up and initial checkout of all items listed in the contract documents, the C. Agency applies appropriate techniques to verify that start-up and initial checkout of all commissioned equipment is successfully completed.
•	The C. Agency is to review and approve the contractor’s Testing & Balancing Contractor functional testing plan prior to the start of testing.
•	The C. Agency is to receive, review, and compile all General Contractor submittals.

Question:	The RFP indicates that the 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will perform mechanical/HVAC services only.  Is this true?

Response:	The 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will provide a commissioning plan, address lighting, environmental responsiveness and energy efficiency, HVAC, fire alarm system, sprinkler system, and LEED Commissioning.  GSA will clarify CMc’s scope regarding commissioning services.

Question:	Is there a duplication of commissioning services?  Commissioning should start during Design to gain a LEED point.  Refer to page 1-24, 4.35-“provide coordination.”

Response:	 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will provide the Commissioning Plan & Testing.  The CMc will do the work; the 3rd Party will observe, test, and verify.  GSA will clarify in amended RFP.

Question:	Is there swing space available?

Response:	There has been some space identified by building management and the previous A-E in the basement.  Some storage will also be converted into swing space.  This needs to be done to accommodate tenants.  GSA is aware that some tenants prefer not to move into this space.

Question:	Will the CMc work with the Building Manager to communicate and address tenant concerns?

Response:	During the Construction phase, the A-E as well as the CMc must have a Tenant Coordinator/Liaison.

Question:	Who will actually move fixtures, furniture, etc?

Response:	The CMc

Question:	Are there funds set-aside for security issues?  U.S. Marshall’s Services (USMS)?

Response:	Some funds are included in the project for guards.  USMS will fund aspects of the project according to their own agency requirements.

Question:	Will the GSA Building Manager be the communication point of contact between the CMc and the tenants?

Response:	Yes.

Question:	How many courtrooms are being renovated?

Response:	None.  No renovation of rooms- just Fire Alarm & Sprinkler systems.

Question:	What if the judge refuses to have fire protection and window replacement in their chambers?  Is there a requirement to make tenants comply?

Response:	We will comply with code.  GSA has a very stringent Fire & Life Safety (FLS) branch that is very involved in the project.  They will ensure that the project will be executed according to code.  They will take a firm responsibility that the code will be enforced.  All tenants will have to participate and comply.  The work will be done after-hours.  Planning is the key to success.

Question:	Are Security Clearances done through Homeland Security?

Response:	Yes.  It is the Contractor’s responsibility (A-E, CMc, CM, sub-contractors) to submit documents and obtain clearance.  Contractors need to be mindful that clearance takes time.

Question:	The RFP states that the selected CMc for pre-construction services will have the option to go to the construction phase.  Is this true?

Response:	Yes.  This is an option that GSA may choose to exercise.

Question:	Clarification needed for page 1-9 regarding: FY2005 Funds vs. Optional work.

Response:	GSA will provide the A-E’s schedule of submission.  It will be provided through an amended RFP or through meeting minutes.

Question:	Is the bonding requirement submitted at bid or at the construction phase?

Response:	At the Construction phase.



Question:	Construction estimates should be broken-out how?

Response:	3 Estimates needed:
•	FY05 Design – base work
•	FY06 Design – optional work
•	FY06 Construction – optional 

Question:	Provide clarification regarding the conversion of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) to a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).  Ref. page 1-4, 2.8.

Response:	Pre-construction should include the base work & option pricing.  The GMP will be established for Construction.  The pricing is due with the bid proposals.

Question:	The CMc will have no control over the Design of the project.  How can a GMP be established if there is no control over the A-E’s design.

Response:	The CMc selected will work with the A-E in the pre-construction phase to adhere to a GMP.


Meeting Concludes with a tour of the building.

All fututur questions must be addressed in writing to Bobbie Tyler.

The Government requests that the CMc contractor submit as an option to their contract, to provide full Independent Commissioning Services, for the pre-construction as well as the construction phases of the project.

<DESC>CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE DUE DATE FOR RESPONSES, DATE OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE MEETING AND THE DATE OF THE GOTS/COTS DEMONSTRATION DAY.  CHANGES ARE SPECIFIED BELOW.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR HOST-BASED SECURITY MANAGER SUPPORT.


SUBJECT:

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) for host-based security tools and centralized manager applications that could be deployed on host-machines across the DoD. Traditional efforts to secure Department of Defense (DoD) networks have been focused on placing defenses at the network boundary with less emphasis on end-point or host-based security. While such defenses as network firewalls and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) have proven effective at countering identifiable threats originating from outside the network boundary, they do not address the insider threat or defend against external threats that are able to penetrate boundary defenses or enter through backdoors. Such threats include viruses, worms or other attacks that target known or previously unknown operating system and application-specific vulnerabilities. In order to address the insider threat, increase end-point security, reduce end-point management requirements, and provide defense in depth, DoD is considering integrating existing capabilities and fielding enhanced host-based security products and associated integrated managers across the enterprise. 

Under the host-based security concept, security products are installed directly on network end-points. In general, this means installing agent-based tools on host machines (e.g., workstations, laptops, servers). In order to be effective across enterprise networks, host-based capabilities must be centrally managed to support installation, monitoring, updating, and configuration however, existing security product management requires an independent manager for each of the multiple products, in effect, reducing time available for detection and response efforts as a result of the excessive redundant management requirements.

DoD intends to integrate existing security products and capabilities, eliminate redundant management processes, and enhance end-point security through a unified security product and management suite. The intent is to reduce the impact of management traffic and redundancy of end-point security agents. For this RFI, the following descriptions will be used: 

Central Manager: The portion of the host-based security manager suite that provides the central management functionality is called the central manager.  The central manager provides centralized installation, management, monitoring, and configuration of host-based Information Assurance (IA) capabilities. This central manager will reside at Tier 3, however it must be able to accept policy and configuration changes from higher-level tiers. Security information collected by Tier 3 central managers will report to higher tiers as well as an external security information manager (SIM). 

Host Agent/Modules(s): Those tools (or portions of tools), which actually perform the tasks associated with protecting host machines, are referred to as modules in this RFI. The local host capability to communicate with the central manager and control modules is referred as the host-based agent or just agent.  The capabilities listed in Section 3.0 could be provided either by a single agent with multiple modules, the use of multiple agents/modules, or a combination of the two. Each module will implement the security policies to be enforced using a set of rules that may be modified by the central manager. 

Additional definitions regarding the functions and designations of host-based security components are given in Attachment 3. A copy of Attachment 3 can be obtained from either Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr. Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.


DESCRIPTION:

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), in support of the Computer Network Defense (CND) mission assigned to the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), is seeking information from industry, academia, and government that will assist in the deployment of host-based security capabilities to enhance the CND posture of the DoD computer network systems. 
The DoD host-based security concept for acquiring and implementing capabilities on DoD computers and computing platforms follows the Network Operations (NetOps) Joint Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the Global Information Grid. Under the NetOps CONOPS, the DoD is organized into three tiers to conduct CND. Tier 1 provides DoD-wide CND operational direction and support to all DoD components. Tier 2 provides DoD component-wide operational direction or support and responds to direction from Tier 1. Tier 3 provides local operational direction and support and responds to direction from a designated Tier 2 entity. Tier 1 entities include the CDRUSSTRATCOM and supporting entities, such as the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO), CND Service Certification Authorities (DISA and the National Security Agency [NSA]), the CND Law Enforcement and Counterintelligence Center, and the National Security Incident Response Center. Tier 2 includes CND Service Providers designated by Heads of Components to coordinate Component-wide CND and associated major command entities. Tier 3 includes all entities responding to direction from DoD Component Tier 2 CND Service Providers, e.g., local control centers that manage and control information systems, networks and services, either deployed or fixed at DoD installations. A copy of Attachment 1 can be obtained from the either Capt Strakos or Mr. Carr. Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.


REQUIREMENTS:

This section describes the desired capabilities for the Host-based Security Manager. The DoD does not expect that any one product will have all of the capabilities listed however, a goal of the Host-based Security Manager is to provide as many of these capabilities as possible under a single management architecture. A solution with multiple products under a single manager is acceptable for the purpose of this RFI. Individual products with a subset of these capabilities are also of interest, and vendors and/or government organizations with these solutions are encouraged to respond to this RFI. A copy of Attachment 2 can be obtained from the either Capt Strakos or Mr. Carr.  Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.

<DESC>President’s Management Council
Marginal Costs Seminar
Request for Information (RFI)

PURPOSE

The President’s Management Council (PMC) seeks information related to private sector solutions that might be used to measure the marginal costs of achieving different levels of performance in Federal government programs.

The purpose of this RFI is to identify available resources and different approaches agencies could use to measure the marginal costs of achieving different levels of performance in Federal programs.     

BACKGROUND


•	The President’s Management Agenda is a comprehensive strategy to improve the management and performance of the federal government.  
•	The Budget and Performance Integration (BPI) Initiative is one of the five government-wide goals designed to integrate program performance with budget decisions and ensure programs use high quality outcome measures and accurately monitor program performance.
•	To successfully achieve the BPI goals, agencies must meet six criteria.  One of these criteria is the ability to accurately estimate the marginal cost of achieving different levels of performance 
•	The marginal cost is the additional cost associated with producing an additional or fewer units of output.  A program would estimate the marginal cost of performance by determining the additional cost to achieve the next unit of performance or the savings from producing one less unit of performance.  For example, if the Patent and Trademark Office wanted to reduce average patent pendency from 31 months to 30 months, they would determine the additional resources that would be required to achieve this performance goal.  
•	Estimating marginal costs requires an understanding of fixed and variable costs.  Marginal cost calculations should also include a thorough explanation of any assumptions.

RFI QUESTIONNAIRE

1.	Describe current or past projects where your firm has estimated the marginal cost of production or performance.  
2.	Describe solutions (tutorials, best practices, other) that your firm developed that can be used to assist federal agencies in estimating the marginal cost of achieving different levels of performance.
3.	Indicate whether the solutions identified in #2 above are best applied to individual programs or can be used on a cross-cutting basis to assist agencies in estimating the marginal cost of achieving different levels of performance.

<DESC>RFI for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) Algorithms Request for Information  For innovative Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) algorithms and/or techniques. Pursuant to FAR 15.2, this notice is being issued as a Research and Development Information Sought.  Contract POC: Elbert Clarke, (256) 876-3149 (voice) (256) 876-8343 (fax) elbert.clarke@us.army.mil, US Army Aviation and Missile Command, AMSAM-AC-OS-RB, R edstone Arsenal, AL  35898 or Earnest Taylor, Contracting Officer (256) 876-8762, earnest.taylor@redstone.army.mil .  This is a pre-solicitation REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).   The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is currently conducting market research only.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does th e Government intend to pay for information received.  Responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  AMRDEC is interested in receiving information on ATR algorithms and/or techniques already in existence that can be utilized for real-time processing of imagery.  Algorithms from diverse technology fields including both non-military and/or military sources are sought.  The objective of this process is to assess the developed algorithms for perfo rmance against electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) imagery in support of US Army missile systems. An EO/IR sensor can be a critical part of this system.  The EO/IR sensor is used for detecting, locating, and targeting fixed, moving and time-critical mobile gr ound targets, whether those targets are in the open or obscured by natural or man-made means.  Innovative algorithms that have been developed for other sensors that are applicable to tactical missile seekers are also of interest.  AMRDEC is seeking algorit hms for automated target acquisition and information extraction from high-resolution EO/IR imagery associated with this and other similar missile systems.  The intended use of these algorithms is to provide a high probability of detection at the detection stage, followed by a classification stage utilizing the information content associated with each detection event.  Information includes features or descriptors associated with a target and/or background that can be used to contribute to classifying the pot ential target as to class (wheeled vs. tracked), recognition (armored personnel carrier vs. tank) and positive  identification (T72 vs. T62).  The desired algorithms should be as robust as possible to factors such as target aspect and scale, clutter backgr ound, and environment.   Algorithms that provide the capability to dynamically adapt to changes in target signatures and background environments would be especially desired.  The algorithms should be focused toward a concept where a minimum of targeting in formation is required once the missile system leaves the factory.  Algorithm approaches that work only at fixed ranges or those that require rigorous a priori knowledge as conventionally employed for ATR are not the focus of this RFI.  The interest lies in  a missile-closing scenario with correct detection and classification becoming more important as the missile enters into the terminal phase of flight.  As on-board processing power and available memory are limited for this application, it is requested that  throughput and memory requirements be considered   Responses to this RFI should only include candidate algorithms that are in a lab-prototype stage or those that have been successfully demonstrated for the application for which they were developed (including other non-defense fields such as medical imaging , hidden information, robotic vision, etc.).  The response should include a white paper of no more than 10 pages describing the algorithm(s) and results-to-date, as well as points of contact for Government sponsors, where applicable.  A rough order-of-magn itude (ROM) cost estimate to implement in near-real-time and i nitially test the algorithm(s) at the contractors facility or at AMRDEC facilities using a limited set of government-furnished captive flight training and test data is requested.  Outputs from these runs should reflect acquisition (detection and/or classi fication) performance as a function of range to target.  RFI responses are to be received within 21 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All information must be in writing or via e-mail; telephone requests for additional information will not be honor ed.  You may forward responses to US Army, AMCOM, AMSAM-AC-OS-RB, Redstone Arsenal, AL, 35898-5000, ATTN: Elbert Clarke or the following e-mail address: elbert.clarke@us.army.mil. Electronic submissions are preferred.   Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued .  If you choose to submit proprietary information, please mark it accordingly.  Appropriate proprietary claims will be honored and protected to prevent improper disclosure.  RFI responses will be accepted from United States companies/organizations only. Classified information will be accepted by mail only, but please mark it accordingly and send it via proper channels.  Classified information can be sent to US Army, AMCOM, AMSAM-AC-OS-RB, Redstone Arsenal, AL, 35898-5000. The inner wrapping shall be addre ssed to: ATTN: AMSRD-AMR-SG-SD (Mr. John Meadows).

<DESC>The US Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center anticipates a need to demonstrate a color changing paint to use on aircraft or vehicles as a deception or camouflage mechanism. Additionally, color changing paint could redu ce the need for paint removal and repainting required by a change in theater terrain. The desired paint should be capable of color change during mission performance (e.g., changing from gray to sky blue or from desert tan to forest green). There are many n on-controllable approaches to altering paint color (such as by external light sources or viewing angles), but the need is for a controllable method. Examples of controllable methods could include temperature or electrical current. Organizations, suppliers and academic institutions interested in developing this technology using existing facilities, or that have had previous research efforts and demonstrations of like technologies should respond. Responses should be as detailed as possible.   This is a market survey requesting information only. No solicitation will be issued against this notice. Interested sources should provide supporting documentation NLT 01July2005 to: AMSRD-AMR-SE-MT (Mr. Scott Hofacker, PE) Bldg. 5400, Room S240, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898.

<RESPDATE>070105
<ARCHDATE>08302005
<CONTACT>Kenneth Bruton, 2568427149
<DESC>The US Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center anticipates a need for a corrosion-identifying paint/coating system to provide early detection of corrosion on metallic substrates and report it through color change.  Corro sion costs the U.S economy $300 billion dollars annually according to published reports.  Early identification of corrosion and early repair before further damage occurs could result in a savings of $100 billion dollars annually. Chemical changes take plac e in metallic substrates such as aluminum alloys, steels, magnesium, titanium, etc (including fasteners). The technology of interest should detect when corrosion starts and produce a noticeable color change. The intention of this coating is not to eliminat e corrosion, but to detect its development at the earliest stages.  As the age of aircraft increases, the corrosion potential also increases.  Early detection is important to maintaining a safe and effective airborne capability.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposer's Day Briefing for Low Altitude Airborne Sensor System (LAASS) Program
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencys (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO) anticipates releasing a Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) in early June 2005 for the Low Altitude Airborne Sensor System (LAASS) Program.  This is an announcement for the Proposers Day Briefing for the LAASS program on 15-16 June 2005 in Arlington, VA. The goal of LAASS is the development of Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) and Manned Aircraft (MAC)-based sensor systems that will detect, locate, and characterize power distribution infrastructure and underground or otherwise hidden facilities and operations in rural or urban environments. These include underground facilities (UGFs), tunnels, buildings/basements, caves, and activities under heavy foliage.  The desired sensor payloads include acoustic, passive electromagnetic (EM), and gravity gradiometers.  A baseline concept for LAASS was developed by a Government Team in Phase 1.  Data were collected using a quiet sensor package on a towbody below a helicopter using off-the-shelf sensors and data acquisition systems.  These data have been used to determine the potential performance of the LAASS concept as a function of sensor noise, altitude, and time on station if the form-fit sensors on UAV and MAC platforms are adequately quieted and advanced algorithms for detection, localization, and imaging are developed.  The purpose of this classified Proposers Day Briefing is to summarize the technical results achieved to-date and to present the goals and structure of the LAASS program to potential bidders.  An unclassified data package will be released to potential bidders, and a 3-4 hour detailed tutorial on its use will be provided.  It is appropriate to bring technical analysis staff with MATLAB-equipped laptops to the tutorial to obtain the maximum benefit, though phone-based database support will be provided during the proposal and execution phase.  One-on-one meetings with the DARPA Program Manager and other members of the LAASS Government Team will be available as well.  It is expected that all material will be presented on day 1 of the briefing, but that additional one-on-one meetings and repeat presentations of results details and database tutorials will be available on day 2. The 12 month Phase 2 Advanced Algorithm Development and System Design activities to be funded under this BAA should focus on sensor packaging and algorithms for sensor SNR enhancement and end-to-end system detection, localization, and target imaging goals.  Their performance should be evaluated using Government furnished data.  The result of this phase will be a concept design and the estimated performance for the Phase 3 prototype, and an updated execution plan and cost for the Phase 3 prototype development effort. Three sensor/platform configurations are of interest: 1) a UAV with EM and Acoustic capability, 2) an EM sensor payload capability for use on existing manned helicopters, and 3) a Gravity Gradiometry sensor, processing, and platform integration design concept for either manned or unmanned rotary wing aircraft.  Proposers may bid on any or all of the sensor/platform configurations. The 27 month Phase 3 Advanced System Prototype Development and Demonstration activities will be funded under this BAA for the performers whose designs are selected from Phase 2. In this phase winning performers will conduct final design, build, and demonstration of the platform-integrated form-fit systems for the sensor/platform configurations they have designed.  SECURITY:  Work under LAASS Program will be classified at the collateral SECRET level.  Proposers must have the required United States personnel clearances, cleared facilities, storage, and processing capabilities to submit a proposal for this solicitation.  DARPA will hold a Proposers Day Briefing for the LAASS BAA05-39 on 15-16 June 2005 at the Booz Allen Hamilton conference facility at 3811 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 600 in Arlington, VA.  Doors will open at 0745, and presentations will begin at 0845.  Potential proposers should indicate their interest via e-mail to SN05-27@darpa.mil to receive further instructions for attending.   The conference schedule will be sent with confirmation emails.  The meeting will be classified at the SECRET/NOFORN level, and Security Clearances should be sent to: Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc., Security Officer:  Angela Garrett, 4001 Fairfax Drive, Suite 750, Arlington, VA 22203, Security Phone Number:  (703) 465-2684, Unclass Fax Number: (703) 465-5746, Cage Code: 1E4G2. Security clearances must be received at Booz Allen Security Office by COB 10 June, 2005.   All attendees at the Proposers Briefing must be pre-approved and pre-registered, including having valid United States security clearances in place before the meeting starts.  The number of attendees per organization may be limited due to space considerations.  All questions regarding attendance should be emailed to SN05-27@darpa.mil. Point of Contact: All potential proposers interested in attending the Proposers Briefing should indicate their interest by emailing SN05-27@darpa.mil.

<SUBJECT>--2005 Annual Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) Workshop held at the Indianapolis Convention Center, 100 South Capitol Avenue, Indianapolis, IN  46225.
<DESC>Please contact Dr. Bert R. Biles, NILMT Associate Director, at 785.532.2104, e-mail address brbiles@ksu.edu for questions or concerns. SOLICITATION OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS TO EXHIBIT DURING 2005 ANNUAL ITAM WORKSHOP (CONFERENCE), 1-4 AUGUST 2005, IN INDIANAPOLIS, IN. DUE XXXXXX DESC:  Sponsors of the 2005 Annual Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) Workshop are seeking commercial firms to exhibit their products and/or services during the four-day 2005 ITAM Workshop.  This year, the ITAM Workshop will be held at the Indianap olis Convention Center, 100 South Capitol Avenue, Indianapolis, IN  46225. The annual ITAM Workshop is the leading national forum for the scientific exchange of technologies, ideas, experiences, and lessons learned that relate to the application of Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) technologies to the Armys military tra ining lands.  The ITAM Programs at all U.S. Army installations must play a critical role in assuring that military training can be sustained at the highest level for the foreseeable future.  Training activities have increased, and training budgets continue  to expand. Businesses, organizations, companies, and individuals with products and services that relate to land management; land repair and reclamation; wind and soil erosion management; air and water quality issues; forestry and crop land management; GIS program dev elopment and support; road and trail creation and maintenance; environmental and climatological monitoring; unexploded ordnance; and other similar topics will find a ready audience among the ITAM Workshop participants. There will be approximately 500 decision-makers representing government and industry attending the 2005 ITAM Workshop.  It provides a unique opportunity to present and explain commercial products and services that can contribute to sustaining military trai ning and training land rehabilitation and maintenance to the ITAM Coordinators and their staffs.  This is the only all-Army event that brings together the ITAM teams from U.S. Army installations worldwide. Compared to the costs of visiting individual military installations, the ITAM Workshop offers a most cost-effective sales strategy for companies and firms to hold significant face-to-face conversations with ITAM Coordinators and their staffs. The 2005 ITAM Workshop will focus on operations and environmental programs for sustaining military training lands and maintaining Army readiness.  In addition to the main program of technical presentations at the Workshop, there will be several specialized  sessions, including a Geographic Information System (GIS) Workshop, a Range Training Lands Program (RTLP) session, a Range and Training Land Analysis (RTLA) Workshop, and individual Major Army Command (MACOM) meetings.    The 2005 ITAM Workshop is being hosted by Camp Atterbury, Edinburgh, IN; the ITAM Installation Steering Committee; and the Army Training and Support Center.   The commercial exhibits will be located in Exhibit Hall E of the Indiana Convention Center (ICC) Monday through Wednesday of the Workshop, 1-3 August, 2005.  In addition, commercial exhibitors may elect to display and demonstrate equipment at Camp Atterbur y on Thursday, 4 August.  Commercial exhibitors may elect to display their products and services just in ICC Exhibit Hall E Monday through Wednesday, just at Camp Atterbury on Thursday, or at both venues.   During the ITAM Workshop, the Morning Breaks, the AM Breaks, and the PM Breaks all will be held in the Food Court adjacent to the commercial exhibit area in ICC Exhibit Hall E.  No program activities or breakout sessions will be scheduled for 30 minutes af ter each AM or PM Break begins on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Tuesday evening, a free, two-hour No-host Social for all participants will be held adjacent to the commercial exhibits in ICC Exhibit Hall E.   Commercial exhibitors are cordially invited to participate in all open ses sions, tours, and social events associated with the 2005 ITAM Workshop. For those commercial exhibitors who are interested, plans are being made to provide extensive support of commercial equipment demonstrations and displays at Camp Atterbury on Thursday, 4 August 2005.  Due to current security concerns, these commercial exhi bits will be approved on a first-come/first-served, case-by-case basis.   All commercial exhibit arrangements will be made through the National Institute for Land Management and Training (NILMT) at Kansas State University, the conference support contractor.  To obtain an application to exhibit during the 2005 ITAM Workshop or to  secure further information, commercial exhibitors may contact Dr. Bert R. Biles, NILMT Associate Director, at 785.532.2104.  Dr. Biles e-mail address is:  brbiles@ksu.edu.   Individuals interested in further information concerning the ITAM program, or in attending the 2005 ITAM Workshop, may find program descriptions and/or register online at:  http://srp.army.mil/public/home.aspx  or register by calling the Kansas State Unive rsity Division of Continuing Learning Registration Desk at 785.532.5569.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Negotiate on a Sole Source Basis to Extend the Period of Performance to May 2012 for Development and Licensure of Recombinant Botulinum AB Vaccine
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to modify contract DAMD17-98-C-8024 and negotiate on a sole source basis with DynPort Vaccine Company LLC (DVC) to extend the development and licensure period of performance to May 2012.  The Jo int Vaccine Acquisition Program Management Office requires a recombinant botulinum vaccine that provides protection against aerosol exposure to toxin serotypes A and B.  This contract modification shall be issued using other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  It would take an unacceptable amount of time and require substantial duplication of costs to reach the stage of deve lopment of the DVC recombinant botulinum vaccine.  The DVC recombinant botulinum toxin AB injectable vaccine candidate is sufficiently mature to enter a Phase 2 clinical trial by January 2006, has an existing good manufacturing practices (GMP) production f acility and a demonstrated manufacturing process scaled to meet production requirements of 1.2 million troop equivalent doses (1 troop equivalent dose = number of doses in primary vaccination series).  No other contractors have a recombinant botulinum toxi n AB candidate at this stage of development.  This is not a request for competitive proposals but parties purporting to have the requisite credentials to perform these services without substantial duplication of cost or unacceptable delays in fulfilling th e agency's requirements must furnish in writing, factual information, which clearly supports and demonstrates that their recombinant botulinum AB vaccine candidate is sufficiently mature to enter a Phase 2 clinical trial by January 2006, has an existing GM P production facility as well as available capacity to meet the needs of the Phase 2 clinical trials, and a demonstrated manufacturing process scaled to meet production requirements of 1.2 million troop equivalent doses.  This information must be e-mailed to Leo Fratis at Leo.Fratis@us.army.mil or faxed to his attention at (301)619-5069 by close of business July 15, 2005.  A determination not to compete this proposed action based on any responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the contrac ting officer.  See numbered note 22.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background:
The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/Military) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of the Military Liaison Unit (MLU) of the Operations Division (OPS) of USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).  These activities include military liaison and coordination, Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) deployment, Response Management Team (RMT) participation and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or Explosive (CBRNE) disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62.  The HAA/Military will serve within the OPS Division’s MLU and will function as the Division’s principal point of contact with the Department of Defense (DOD).

Introduction:
OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA’s capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The Operations Division (OPS) consists of three teams; the Operations Support Team (OST), the Overseas Administration Team (OAT), and the Field Support Team (FST).

The OST provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue (SAR), Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, Consequence Management, overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and other sectors necessary to assure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The OAT provides administrative services to OFDA’s field offices.  The OAT also manages the Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) program, which provides rapid, surge capacity staffing.

The FST coordinates surge capacity staffing mechanisms, manages an inter-agency agreement with the US Forest Service for surge capacity staffing and OFDA response system design, maintains and trains on disaster response systems such as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) and the Response Management Team (RMT), coordinates with other agencies in the USG and with some elements of the UN, and coordinates the Public Donations Information and Outreach project.

OBJECTIVE:
The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military will provide the critical liaison function between USAID and the DoD military establishment in order to represent the humanitarian sector perspective and expertise in situations where coordination between the parties is required.

STATEMENT OF WORK:
The OFDA Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses.  The OPS Division identifies sources for procurement of relief supplies and manages the stockpiling and transportation of those supplies.  The Division maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams and the Office’s capability for deploying Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Response Management Teams (RMTs) in Washington.  The Division develops and maintains OFDA’s relationships with DOD, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Energy (DOE).

The HAA/Military will be assigned to the OPS MLU in Washington, D.C. for an initial period of 2 years.  Travel is required to attend DOD conferences, exercises and other related activities on behalf of USAID, OFDA, a particular DART or RMT and/or a CBRNE planning exercise as directed by the OFDA/OPS Division Chief through the MLU Leader.

• Representing OFDA in appropriate DOD training and planning exercises with subsequent reporting to OFDA divisions on activities, lessons learned, success and future activities as a result of OFDA participation;

• Supporting OFDA management in defining a strategy for military coordination which will include guidelines for determining OFDA participation in DOD operations when specific requests are made and where OFDA should request activities and participation;
• Determining whether OFDA participation in DOD humanitarian activities is necessary and useful;
• Providing OFDA briefings and training to uniform military officers at various DOD educational institutions (War Colleges, National Defense University, Navy Postgraduate School, etc.);
• Coordinating with DOD and the Department of State’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs to provide OFDA staff with briefings on military procedures, assets, roles, capabilities, culture, chain-of-command and humanitarian-related activities and circulate status reports which summarize DOD activities in which OFDA personnel are involved;
• Deploying with DOD forces in humanitarian emergencies;
• Providing reports, debriefs and evaluations to the OPS Division Chief and other appropriate OFDA staff of all planning, exercises and deployments;
• Assisting in the identification of OFDA’s Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division deployment needs in designated "at risk" countries where DARTs may deploy and work with other teams within OFDA to determine appropriate DART needs as a basis for contingency planning for personnel and resources;
• Availability for deployment to the field as a DART member;
• Assisting the MLU in providing classified U.S. Government (USG) information support to OFDA as requested and to selected DARTs and RMTs on an as-needed basis;
• Assisting regional Combatant Commanders (COCOMs)  in developing the humanitarian assistance aspect of their strategic operations and crisis action planning products; and
• Liaison with the DOD and other elements of the USG in an effort to help the military coordinate with the humanitarian community.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The incumbent will take direction from and report to the OPS MLU Leader in Washington, DC.

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

"Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.   The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.   Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.   Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.   This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C., 20593, Telephone:  202-267-2285

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.   The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.   Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.   Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.   Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C., 20593, Telephone:  202-267-2285

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This acquisition is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The combined synopsis/solicitation number is W91ZLK-05-T-0619.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clau ses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 97-27.  The associated North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 333314 and the Business Size Standard is 500.   The contractor shall  provide the following : QTY 1. Flig ht Follower System  for tracking projectiles in free flight,with the following: including the Servo Motor with Mirror in environmental housing, controller unit,trigger interface unit, control computer with software for standard tracking, software for acell eration tracking of rockets and decelleration, drag, retardation  150 meter control cable on reel, manual on disk, power cords.  Future Combat Systems testing requires the capability to track and image projectiles (both threat and countermunition) from muz zle, throughout the flight,to impact.  The tracking must be continuous.  If multiple projectiles are fired, a tracking system is required for each one.  The requestor does not have sufficient flight follower systems to meet this requirement.  Under the cur rent system the army has to use multiple fixed camera systems placed along the flight path, is not at the exact same point every time there is a high probability of not having coverage resulting in no data.  It is not practical to line the entire trajector y with fixed cameras as the distance is sometime tens to hundreds to meters long.  The requested flight follower system will give customers a single continuous visual recording from muzzle through the majority of the flight path, as opposed to multiple ind ivid ual cameras trying to cover the same field of view.  In some tests the entire flight path from point of firing through impact will be possible.  The acquisition and capability of a flight follow system will replace multiple high-speed camera assets an d provide complete image coverage to the test.  The requested flight follower must be capable of a tracking angle of 100 degrees total with 90 degrees of tracking and accuracy better than 0 .5 degrees.  The system must be able to communicate over long dist ances via RS-2 32/RS-485 protocols.  Trigger input into the system must be able to support a positive or negative edge 5 volt TTL pulse .  The system must be able to support mirror scan ratios between 4-40 (projectile velocity/stand off distance).  System software must have the capability to enter user-defined velocity profile inputs and built in drag correction and trigger delay inputs.  The hardware must be able to accommodate the various high-speed camera systems that ATC own, in particul ar the Redlake HG 100K and the Vision Research Phantom 7 cameras. ATC currently has a DRS Flight Follower system and the new procurement needs to be compatible with the existing government owned system.  The new system must be able to work in tand em to capture imaging d ata on the same test, involving two projectiles or threats, consistency of operation, imaging cap abilities and data quality are critical. Acceptance shall be at Destination.  Shipping shall be FOB Destination.  Delivery shall be to the U.S. Army Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md 21001. The following clauses will be incorporated by reference. 52.209-6 Protecting the Governments Interest When Subcontracting with contractors debarred, suspended or proposed for debarment.   52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Co mmerical Items, 52.223-11 Ozone-Depleting Substances,  52-247-34 F.O.B.

<DESC>Below are questions posed by potential offerors and answers from the Contracting Squadron.  Proposals are due 8 June 2005 at 1600EST. 

Q: Will the elevator be available for use in moving?
A: Yes

Q: When will the walls be finished?
A: Approximately 8 June 2005

Q: Is there a loading dock?
A: Yes

Q: What is the width of the interior door jams?
A: 34.5 inches

Q: Are the lecterns pictured in the drawings a part of this bid package?
A: No they will be a part of a future package

Q: What is the building completion date?
A: 15 August 2005

Q: What type of Internet connection will be offered?
A  LAN they will not be wireless

Q: Is the PDF File to scale?
A: The PDF File is NOT to scale.  The AUTOCAD model space is to scale. 

Q: How can bid be submitted?  
A: By Mail, Fax, E-mail

Q: How is the electrical system to be set up?
A: It will be hard-wired from the wall.  

Q: Can the drawings be saved to an ACAD2000?
A: Yes they can be saved to Acad2000.

Q:  What is the size of the LCD monitors?
A;   17” LCD’s.

Q.  Are power clusters required on the 42x30 desks also, or only on the 72x30 desks?
A:  Yes they are required for both desks.

Q.  The additional power spec is unclear, it says that the power cord must be long enough so that the strip can go into the farthest desk from the wall.  On a four desk cluster that will be 168" from the wall (is that correct for cord length)?
A:   Can’t give a specific dimension. That would depend on the vendors desk sizes, but the idea is to leave enough slack that the cords can reach furthest desk from the wall.



Q.  On the three desk clusters how many power strips will be required?  The spec only mentions each group of 4
A: Two power strips for each three desks.  

Q: Can more specifics be given on the chair requirement?
A: The principal characteristic that we are looking for in the chairs is that they function with the desk that are in each offerors' proposal.  They need to meet the guidelines in the statement of work.

AMENDMENT 5: This is the last amendment prior to award.  

Q26. Should we include in our price estimate the cost of the weapon mounts or will these be provided as government furnished equipment (GFE)?
A26. Yes, you should include this in your cost estimate as the weapon mounts will not be GFE.
Q27. Who is going to be reviewing the drawings and determining what is exactly like the sample shown?
A27. The technical evaluation committee will be evaluating the drawings to determine technical acceptance.
Q28. Is the cargo strap to be included as a modification?
A28.  No, the cargo strap was a sidebar conversation and will not be included in the evaluation or modifications.
Q29.  What grade of metal is being used/evaluated?
A29. This was not discussed at the site visit and is up to the contractor to decide what is appropriate for the modification.
Q30. To be fair, all quotes need to be for what was exactly seen?
A30.  Quotes from each contractor need to be for the modifications discussed.  We will be evaluating each modification as if it can perform the required function, not if they look exactly like the modifications already in place.  The purpose of the site visit was to give contractors a better idea of what we were looking for in terms of modifications.
