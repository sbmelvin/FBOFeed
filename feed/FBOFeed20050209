<CONTACT>Debra M. Bridge Contract Specialist 7037871814     Debra.Bridge@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS), U. S. Department of the Interior, intends to competitively award a contract for a study to address the potential biological and physical impacts associated with the dredging of sand resource areas identified offshore the northeast coast of Florida as possible material for beach and coastal restoration.  These concerns include the effects of offshore dredging on resident biological organisms and on the local wave climate and sediment transport regime.  The information provided from this study will be used to prepare environmental analyses to meet the requirements of current environmental laws and legislation and incorporate results, as appropriate, in lease requirements for the use of OCS sand.  The MMS is hereby soliciting requests for Capability Statements from interested parties to propose on this requirement, (FAR Part 15.202 Advisory Multi-Step Process).  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement-type contract.  The solicitation number for this requirement is 39075 and must be referenced on your written documents.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  All offerors must be able to qualify under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710 "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences" with the size standard of 500 employees.  SCOPE OF WORK: Specific study tasks will include the development and conduct of a biological field data collection/computer numerical modeling program offshore the northeast coast of Florida to address the following issues: Characterization and evaluation of benthic habitats, biological communities (infauna, epifauna, demersal, and pelagic fishes), and sediment grain size in several areas identified as potential sources of sand for beach and coastal  restoration/renourishment offshore the Florida counties of Nassau, Duval, St. Johns, Flagler and Volusia. Biological field data collected will be used in conjunction with existing literature to the maximum extent possible; Assessment of the potential effects of offshore sand dredging on benthic and pelagic communities, including an analysis of the potential rate and success of recolonization following cessation of dredging; Using the procedures and conclusions set out in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Special Report 262: A Process for Setting, Managing, and Monitoring Environmental Windows for Dredging Projects (http://trb.org//publications/sr/sr262.pdf) as a guide, development of a time schedule of environmental windows that best protects benthic and pelagic species from adverse environmental effects; Examination of the potential for alteration in the local wave field following dredging and the excavation of sand from within the potential sand borrow sites; Examination of the potential for increased wave action after dredging within the potential sand borrow sites and any resultant adverse localized changes in erosional patterns and longshore coastal transport which could result in significant losses of beach sand after renourishment; Examination of the potential for changes in local sediment transport rates as a result of altering the local bathymetry, particularly in light of the recent studies which indicate that bathymetry does influence the manner in which waves approach the shoreline during storm events; Examination of the cumulative physical effects of multiple dredging events and extraction of a large volume of material within the identified potential borrow sites.  The period of performance of this study is anticipated to be a maximum of 32 months from date of contract award.  The estimated cost range is between $475,000 to $525,000.  QUALIFICATION FACTORS:  To compete for this contract, an offeror must demonstrate qualifications to perform the work by providing, no later than close of business February 23, 2005, a Capabilities Statement describing, in detail:  (A) Key technical personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the tasks with their qualifications, their specific experience, and publication record in peer reviewed scientific journals; (2) your access to equipment and facilities necessary to accomplish the tasks; (3) your organization's prior experience conducting monitoring projects of similar scope and complexity; and (4) specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with point of contact & phone number & email address) for previous work of this nature that key personnel or organization has performed within the last three years (references will be checked).  If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  Capabilities Statements will be evaluated on the basis of (A) Understanding of project scope and objectives; (B) Experience and expertise of all key technical personnel; (C) Relevance of all key personnel's qualifications to their assigned task, and their estimated level of effort; (D) Organizational history of timely completion of similar projects, adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of cost controls, and quality of products delivered; (E) The degree of comparability of past projects to the current project, including number, complexity, and sizes.

Vendors register themselves and maintain their own information through the CCR web site. If not already registered, we encourage entities interested in USBR business to register in the system now, to avoid any disruption or loss of awards after the revised regulation takes effect.  To register or learn more about the CCR, go to:  www.ccr.gov/vendor.cfm.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by this agency.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.  The submission may be converted to a claim by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as a liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
       (d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.  A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.

<RESPDATE>022305
<ARCHDATE>05092005
<CONTACT>john.flaherty@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>SOW for IRTSS Maintenance/Configuration Management Effort <br><br> 1. Introduction <br><br> IRTSS is a combat proven tool that utilizes current remote sensing capabilities to predict the appearance of thermal infrared target area scenes as viewed on cockpit displays.  IRTSS fuses multi-spectral imagery, target characteristics, sensor performance parameters, and current weather forecasts to produce a through-the-sensor view of the engagement area prior to mission execution.  The product has a number of operational users that both need support and training and a product that is maintained in an efficient manner.  This Statement of Work addresses these items for the users. <br><br> 2. Tasks <br><br> 2.1 Develop, maintain, and manage a problem reporting system where users may submit issues to be addressed. <br><br> 2.2 Develop, maintain, and manage a problem-tracking database that allows developers to address specific concerns of the users in a prioritized and operationally significant manner. <br><br> 2.3 Document and maintain monthly reports to AFRL on status of software maintenance and user feedback.  Prepare an annual consolidated report <br><br> 2.4 Develop, maintain, and manage  a configuration management system for the IRTSS multi-platform software.  This process must allow for logical and coordinated development of new releases for distribution. <br><br> 2.5 Distribute  new software releases to users. <br><br> 2.6 Develop and execute software regression tests  Testing must be conducted on all program upgrades.  A testing process must include continued structuring to insure thorough and complete tests are available to exercise all additions to the software.  The tests will insure that additions to the code are valid and do not introduce errors.  Release testing needs to be established and conducted before distribution. <br><br> 2.7 Provide field support to IRTSS users.  Continue the established IRTSS helpline and  man it with a competent IRTSS team member.  Problems may be solved over the phone or via email contact.  A record of support incidents and the time spent on the support must be developed and maintained. <br><br> 2.8 Process imagery required by IRTSS.  As new users receive IRTSS in different parts of the world, they need IRTSS geo-databases that cover their intended mission areas. <br><br> 2.9 Construct IRTSS targets.  Requirements for target come from field users on a regular basis.  Develop and maintain a record of these requirements and the progress of target construction for each requested target. <br><br> 2.10 Develop and maintain a Configuration Control Board (CCB) process. Develop a CCB charter and establish a CCB to include  developing a CCB schedule, convening CCBs on a regular basis,, transcribing minutes of the meetings, distributing pertinent information to the board members, and managing voting and decisions made by the board. <br><br> 2.11 Expand the IRTSS sensor model library.  IRTSS requires models for each sensor platform intended for IRTSS use.  As users expand so too must the library of sensor models in the software.  The process of adding new sensors must include comparisons between IRTSS output and actual video from the sensor. <br><br> 2.12 Develop and provide training.  Establish a class and distribute a video/presentation to supplement the IRTSS user's manual as a first step to assure that users know the best ways to use IRTSS for their greatest benefit.  If IRTSS is incorporated into the Weapons school or other schools, develop a train-the-trainer course. <br><br> 2.13 Develop an IRTSS Users Group Meeting process.  With the increase in IRTSS users an annual user's group meeting is necessary to inform users of the latest developments in IRTSS and allow the laboratory to receive feedback from the users on their needs and concerns about the product. <br><br> 2.14 Develop an IRTSS informational NIPRNET website.  Currently there is only a SIPRNET website for users to keep track of IRTSS information.  A NIPRNET site should be created and both sites must be regularly updated and managed. <br><br> 2.15 Provide IRTSS hardware on an emergency basis.  ACC or  individual units purchase the necessary video cards or other hardware for the IRTSS servers. On an emergency basis distribute IRTSS hardware to operational requestors.  Follow-up with receiving units to assure the hardware is installed properly and the IRTSS server works properly <br><br> GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE-$270,000.00 for 1 year IRTSS was developed by RADEX inc. <br><br>  See Note 26.

<DESC>GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Lead Designer

FOR THE BIRCH BAYH U.S. COURTHOUSE, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA

Architect Engineer Services Solicitation #GS05P05GBC0001 Indianapolis, Indiana

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in adaptive reuse architecture, historic preservation, mechanical and electrical engineering. Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Professional Services are required for the preservation, modernization and renovation of the Birch Bayh Courthouse in Indianapolis, Indiana. 

Through the preservation and modernization of an historic federal building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation. In accord with this tradition, the GSA Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values.  As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements. All projects will be LEED-EB certified. 

The facility, designed by Rankin and Kellogg and built in 1905, is 459,121gross square feet and contains 373,876 rentable square feet. The structure is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is located in the heart of downtown Indianapolis, at 46 East Ohio Street. The project proposes to replace the roof, the flashing, and downspouts; upgrade the windows; upgrade toilet rooms to meet ADA and provide major alterations to mechanical, electrical, life safety, and plumbing systems, at the Birch Bayh U.S. Courthouse.  The project also includes preservation of many of the building’s historic mosaics, frescoes, and murals.  

The Estimated Construction Cost range of the project is $35 million to $45 million.  The scope of work may include, but is not limited to, the following: survey of the existing conditions; detail scope verification; presentations for client and historic preservation agencies; energy conservation analysis; complete architectural and engineering design; preparation of specifications and CADD drawings for construction documents; value engineering; cost analysis; post construction contract services (PCCS); record drawings and construction phase A-E inspection services; and other related services deemed necessary to provide for a completely functional facility. Throughout the design process, the selected A-E will assist the Government in identifying those elements of work that can be accomplished within the Congressionally mandated cost limitation for the project. The construction contract is envisioned to be procured through a source selection process that will incorporate a base contract and options for those elements of work that can be executed within the congressionally mandate cost limitation. Drawings shall be created and submitted in native AutoCAD, latest release. Drawings created in other CAD programs and then translated into AutoCAD are not acceptable. Formatting for electronic drawings shall be per GSA standards. Specifications, reports, databases, and similar items shall be submitted in the latest MSOffice edition available at the time of contract award. The firm/joint venture shall update software versions at their own expense. 

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The Lead Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.  The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In STAGE I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the Lead Designer and/or Design Firm. In STAGE II, short-listed firms will be interviewed. 

STAGE I: The first stage will establish the architectural capabilities of the  Lead Designer. The A/E Firm as used in the RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The mechanical/electrical engineering requirements are a large portion of the total scope of this project but those disciplines will be evaluated in phase II. In the first stage, a short list minimum of three (3) A-E design firms will be selected for continuation into the second phase. The short list will be based on the A-E design firms’ submittal in response to this request for qualification (RFQ). The A-E design firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver design excellence in judicial design, historic preservation, and renovation of large complex projects, and will express its design approach and philosophy. The documentation will be in an 8 ½” x 11” format.  The assembled Stage 1 portfolio should be no more than 1/2” thick..

Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria:    (1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%): The A-E design firm shall submit graphics (maximum of five pages per project) of five (5) relevant projects completed with the past 10 years. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including tangible evidence where possible i.e. certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. Demonstrating design excellence) and discuss, if relevant, how the historic preservation, working in an occupied facility, and other design constraints were satisfied by the design solution. 2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%): In the lead designer’s words (maximum of two written pages), state his/her overall design philosophy as it relates to this project, approach to public architecture, the challenge of resolving historic preservation issues and parameters that may apply specifically to the modernization of historic buildings with the focus on the unique aspects of installing state-of-the-art and flexible utility systems in historic buildings. (3) LEAD PORTFOLIO (25%): Submit a written description (maximum of one page per project) and graphics ( (maximum of three per project) of up to three (3) relevant designs completed within the past ten years attributable to the lead designer. Narratives shall include a discussion of design challenges as well as the resolution(s) and lead designer’s philosophy, responsibility, and influence on the design team. (4) LEAD DESIGNER’S PROFILE (15%): Submit a biographical sketch including education, professional experience, and recognition for design efforts. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to this project.  

STAGE II: The short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Parts I and II that reflect the entire design team.  The SF 330 may be obtained from http://www.gsa.fov.forms.far.htm. The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  

The Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the design team’s understanding of the unique aspects of the project, their design philosophy, project management process, and quality assurance plan.    Responses to the evaluation criteria and interview questions will be used to rank the A/E Teams.

This selection is open to A/E design firms within the United States. When developing the project team required for Stage II, at least 35% of the design effort (including working drawings) must be performed within the designated geographical area (state of Ohio). In Stage II of the selection process, the short-listed A/E design firms are required to demonstrate how this will be accomplished. Stage II: Following short listing, the successful offerors shall submit SF 330 for their entire project team.. Continuity of key personnel for the duration of the project will be essential. It is not necessary to re-submit information submitted in Phase I. GSA will establish the date these submittals are due and will provide new selection criteria for the interviews and final selection. The turnaround for the submission of the SF 330’s will be within 5 weeks of the short listed firm’s notification. This serves as notice to all interested firms that interviews will be conducted promptly after receipt of SF 330s: GSA plans to interview the short-listed firms in Chicago at a time and place to be determined and described in the shortlist notification. All firms need to be cognizant that an award is scheduled for April 2005. The contract for AE services will be awarded pending availability of funds.

This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. In accordance with 15 USC 631 Et. Seq., the A-E will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, small woman-owned, HUBZone small business and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of the contract. The use of subcontractors/consultants shown in the Stage II Form 330 will be reflected in a Subcontracting Plan which will be included in the contract. The detailed plan is required to be submitted. Each individual firm will determine the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals for this project. A small business criterion for each category is based on the contractor’s average annual receipts for the proceeding three fiscal years. Contact your local SBA office for further information. Firms seeking consideration for this contract shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest subcontracting goals possible for small business, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business and small disadvantaged business concerns. Firms advancing to Stage II must also provide a brief written narrative of outreach efforts made to utilize small, disadvantaged, HUDZone and women-owned businesses.

<DESC>Engineering Field Activity Southeast/ROICC Jacksonville is seeking interest from 8(a) firm participants with bona-fide places of business in the northeast Florida area or southeast Georgia area within 50 miles of Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay. The Navy is targeting the issuance of an additional ten (10) Basic Ordering Agreement's (BOA's) to supplement the seven currently in place. The estimated period of performance will be three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c). BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the US Small Business Administration (SBA)district offices. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between EFASE/ROICC (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA holders will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA, and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On an annual basis, the NAVY and SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) the usefulness and need for service, and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to the BOA holders for submission of a proposal. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual document, i.e. task order, will be issued and the BOA holder will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the task order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. Competition for the BOA task orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA District noted. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $2,500.00 that can be placed on a task order with a maximum of $3,000,000.00. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $100,000.00 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order over $25,000.00. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the BOA holder or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire services from he BOA holders only. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types. EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc. exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems.

DESIGN: On-site design solutions for emergency calls and Design/Build Services for minor construction items. The NAICS sub sectors assigned to the subject BOA requirements are 233,234,235,236,237 and 238. Each BOA may also contain a sole source provision to authorize the acquisition of emergency repairs and solutions to emergency calls relative to design/build services for minor construction items. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military installations within the Engineering Field Activity Southeast (EFASE) area of responsibility, including NAS Jacksonville, NS Mayport, and Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay, GA. The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. IF a firm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the BOIA holder and the BOA will terminate. Termination of the BOA under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the BOA with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued orders. The BOA holders maybe required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:(1) Provide 8(a) Certification and applicable district or an 8(a) participant with a bona-fide place of business in either location; (2) Registered in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database; contractors may visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr2000.com/ for information on registering and checking the CCR; (3)Licensed/Bonded and fully capable to perform construction work under the NAICS Codes stated above which will be identified with each potential task order requirement.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009: PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Minister Ali M. Abbassov, Minister of Communications and Information Technologies of Azerbaijan, Attention: Strategic Restructuring of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies Project—Azerbaijan, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, Virginia, Phone: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to specifically help the Minister and his management team in accomplishing the transitional tasks necessary to lead the new Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies (MCIT).

In February of 2004, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, announced his intention to liquidate the Ministry of Communications and form the MCIT.  The new MCIT is intended to have a purely regulatory function, rather than have responsibility for the commercial communications sector in Azerbaijan as the Ministry of Communications formerly did.  The move is seen as positive, as it will likely increase market-oriented reforms in Azerbaijan and could open up the sector to more private sector participation.  It is especially important as it moves Azerbaijan closer towards commitments in the telecommunications sector regarding WTO accession.  

The implementation of appropriate legal and regulatory reforms will assist Azerbaijan in establishing a more market-friendly environment in which to do business, especially in the telecom sector.  Azerbaijan’s extensive dependence on oil and gas-related activities to generate GDP is what helps to generate a strong Information and Communications Technology (ICT) market as more and more oil companies are establishing offices, communications networks, and broadband connections.  This surge in Azerbaijan’s wealth is creating enormous opportunities and demands in the market for complete telecommunications solutions.  However, until Azerbaijan takes decisive steps in reforming the legal and regulatory framework and management structure responsible for transparent telecom operations, limitations will remain and hinder the commercial and developmental growth of the ICT sector.

This technical assistance will specifically help the Minister and his management team in accomplishing the transitional tasks necessary to lead the new MCIT.  This will include advisory services related to technology transfer, restructuring, and organizational management.  This working level assistance will enhance the new ministry’s understanding of modern practices in the ICT sector and help identify and outline a timeline for the implementation of new institutional relationships with which to improve national policy making.  This will also include assistance with issues related to regulation, licensing, interconnection, tariff management, and enforcement of ICT sector rules and regulations.

An important component to this TA will be assisting the MCIT in handling key tasks related to the establishment and implementation of interconnection and regulatory policies, critical to attracting and maintaining investment.  Further, this TA will assist with the country’s democratic development via the creation of a favorable environment that would expedite Azerbaijan’s transition to a more information-based society through the wide application of ICT technologies and practices. 

The technical assistance will also incorporate an Orientation Visit of executives of the MCIT.  This 10-day visit will be carried out by the selected contractor and abide by all of USTDA’s reporting requirements.  This OV will provide the directors of the MCIT with general exposure to and education on the ICT sector and the structure of its management in the United States.  The delegates will visit with state regulators and lawyers, as well as with suppliers and operators to gain a better understanding of how to further develop the MCIT.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $734,782 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to USTDA by 4:00 PM, MARCH 25, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SUBJECT>R -- NATIONAL ALCOHOL AND DRUG ADDICTION RECOVERY MONTH
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-05M000070
<RESPDATE>022405
<ARCHDATE>03112005
<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Substance and Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The Johnson Institute, Washington, DC .

Purpose:

The Johnson Institute has addressed barriers to addiction prevention, treatment and recovery since the 1960s. The organization grew from a church study group at St. Martin’s Episcopal Church in Minneapolis, where Rev. Vernon Johnson, Irene Whitney and others with personal experience in recovery, challenged the idea that an alcoholic could not get help until he or she naturally reached a “bottom” – a state of surrender usually occurring after family, job, finances or other supports had evaporated. They developed a method of “intervention” that penetrated the barrier of denial and helped the alcoholic to accept professional care. 

The mission/goal of Johnson Institute is to address the barriers to recovery and includes the training thousands of counselors around the world, pioneering in workplace “employee assistance” systems, and addressing family and youth aspects of addiction disease. 

Johnson Institute is an organization of recovered individuals and family members with a variety of professional skills and a passion for conquering chemical dependency in our lifetime. Johnson Institute supports innovation in science and practice, a strong voice for the recovery community, a family view of the illness, and significant efforts to identify and arrest illness in its earliest evidence. 

Through their work in communities and their belief in the importance of family, Johnson Institute worked in 2004, 2003 and 2002 with the Major League Baseball (MLB) teams to bring the topic of alcohol and drug use disorders, treatment and recovery to the attention of thousands during baseball games that highlighted National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month (Recovery Month) and included SAMHSA officials and other designated dignitaries such as Lou Johnson, former Los Angeles player and member of the Los Angeles Drug and Alcohol Advisory Committee was featured as the supporter at the Los Angeles Dodgers game on September 10, 2004 and “Sudden Sam” McDowell, former major league player and native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania presented at the September 21, 2004 Pittsburgh Pirates game.  In 2003, former baseball greats in recovery - Darryl Strawberry and Ken Caminiti were involved in Recovery Month MLB events.  The first lady of Ohio, Mrs. Hope Taft has attended Recovery Month MLB events in both 2003 and 2004.

This already established relationship and the eagerness of MLB to continue this tradition, the Johnson Institute is the organization best equipped to not only continue the tradition, but to expand the involvement of MLB as a host of multiple Recovery Month event hosts and to encourage the involvement of the league, owners, staff, players and their families in sharing their stories of how the disease of alcohol and drug use disorders, treatment and recovery has touched their lives.
The Major League Baseball initiative will be an integral part of SAMHSA/CSAT=s 16th annual National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month.  The effort herein being proposed is for the participation and involvement of the professional baseball community in the recognition of the need to support alcohol and drug addiction treatment and that addiction knows no boundaries in race, gender, culture and social and economic status.  Baseball has been coined as America’s National pastime and millions of Americans tune into and attend Major League Baseball (MLB) games.  MLB players and coaches become household names and are admired as heroes and leaders by children and adults.  They are seen to add value to events, initiatives and activities by civic leaders and the community and therefore are used to encourage participation and involvement due to their draw.  

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking innovative  technologies and solutions from industry to assist the Government with its requirement for an Emergency Notification System (ENS). The ENS will be competed on a full and open basis for a Firm fixed Price purchase order for a replacement Emergency Notification System (ENS).  The Government will be responsible for the installation and operation of the system. The ENS shall consist of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) to the maximum extent practicable.  The ENS must be wholly owned and operated by the Government and cannot rely on any commercial infrastructure.   The Statement of Work (SOW) may include but not be limited to software development, logistics considerations, maintenance, environment (to include exposure, storage/transportation, electronic coverage/connectivity, performance and reliability, and safety) equipment (to include request devices (i.e., antennae, power requirements, urgent request devices and routine request devices, notification Devices and central management units).  There will be information exchanges between the Government and the contractor that will lead to a contractor prepared and conducted design review.  The contractor shall also provide the Government with operational and maintenance manuals for the ENS System, training, and installation support.   The Government is seeking a three (3) year warranty for all ENS components and a four-year extended operations and maintenance/ warranty support option beyond the original three-year warranty.  In addition, the Government will be seeking an option, with pricing, for the purchase of additional ENSs for a period of five years after contract award.  The ENS shall operate in a frequency band in which the United States Government has primary user status or can obtain primary user status and shall be capable of being operated at locations around the world.

Each system must be deployable anywhere in the world and capable of providing a principal with the means to notify members of a response team in an emergency situation or support staff for routine assistance.  Each system must support the use of multiple alert call devices, summons call devices, and receive devices.  An “Alert Call” device is used when the principal is under distress and must initiate a call by physically knocking over the alert call device.  Also “Alert Call” devices should provide the principal the ability to cancel a call when a unit is accidentally knocked over.  A “Summons Call” device is used by the principal to summon staff for assistance during normal operations and must initiate a call when a button on the unit is pushed.  A “Summons Call” device should be of a size and weight appropriate for convenient yet discrete operation from a tabletop or desktop.  “Receive Devices” are carried “on-the-belt” by support staff and must provide audible and vibration notification when a call device has been activated.  A “Receive Device” must be capable of displaying an alphanumeric message that corresponds to the location of the activated call device.  The notification system shall be capable of minimizing the delay from call initiation to notification at the receive device.  Systems that allow for a direct link between a call device and receive device are highly desirable.  System components must allow for reconfiguring the location information that is provided by a specific call device and for interchanging components between systems.  A system may encompass up to 25 call devices (Summons Call and Alert Call) and 5 receive devices.  The system must provide continuous (100% coverage) throughout a large estate (typically 100 yard radius).  Since potential environments contain varying propagation characteristics and coverage requirements, the system should provide the means to easily and discretely extend coverage range.  Each system must be a turnkey system that does not require the use of external telecommunication systems such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) to provide the necessary connectivity.  Minimizing installation and setup time as well as system size and weight are primary considerations.  Systems must be transportable in suitcase or briefcase style travel cases.  Systems are required to operate in the event of interruption or unavailability of local power. The Government will require training for the users of this system. Innovative training concepts  (i.e. CBT) will be considered.  The Contractor shall include phone numbers and names for points of contact.


  This is a Request for Information from those sources that can supply innovative technologies and solutions to the requested services and supplies.   Please respond by fax to (202) 757-5256 or email to stella.davis@disa.mil if your company posesses a solution(s) for this requirement.   This notice is only a Request for Information and does not obligate the Government to solicite for the aformentions ENS.  Interested parties may respond to this Request for Infromation requirement no later than 23 Feburary 2005, 2:00 p.m. EST.  All reponses must be made to the fax or email address listed above.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.

Any ADR shall be completed within 60 days of the Contractor’s request, unless the parties agree to a longer period.

Correspondence may be sent by post to Mr. Dinwoody at the following address: James Dinwoody AFSAC/PKP 1822 Van Patton Dr. Bldg. 210 Front Wright Patterson, OH  45433-5337 NOTE: Our customers are concerned with maintaining visibility and accuracy of  shipped assets.   We are proposing a requirement to require all incoming and  outgoing material to be shipped to a centralized location in order to confirm  receipt + verification of correct asset, accuracy of shipping documents and to  perform a final inspection before shipment.  Since cost is also a priority for  our customers, we don’t want this to result in a large price increase.  We  would like your comments concerning the best commercial practices for this  requirement.  Is there a better way to ensure asset in-transit visibility?   Please provide your comments by 3 December 2004. NOTE: All Prospective Offerors:  Please review all updated attached files  below and provide your comments and questions by 3 December 2004.  It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.   SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III)  ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought Parts and Repair  Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and  operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently  active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some  customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives  more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material  (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is  not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for  supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However,  the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD  approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of  the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized)  sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award  fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised  to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of  contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

<DESC>Systems Engineering (SE) TOOL Request for Information  THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE.  Overview  NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) is openly soliciting inputs and ideas for its Systems Engineering (SE) Tool. This tool will be used to support a robust and comprehensive systems engineering and integration process in the ESMD. Specifically, this tool will support ESMD efforts to pursue capabilities and supporting research and technologies that will enable sustainable and affordable human and robotic exploration.  Key areas that this tool will support include requirements management (to include development, analysis and documentation), logical systems design (to include system concept analysis, system and/or architecture diagramming and trade tree documentation), architecture and technology analyses (to include functional allocation and analysis), and management of the supporting trade studies and corresponding results. This SE tool must enable the engagement of a large multi-organization, distributed team that will be working in the previously mentioned key areas.  An example use case of this tool would involve: 1) an engineer or team of engineers utilizing the tool to perform a conceptual logical system design; 2) the “final” conceptual reference system design being captured in the tool, via DODAF-like architecture models/views; 3) a central repository providing access to that reference system design; 4) the tool being used by the requirements analysis team to decompose the system functions into requirements; 5) an engineer’s “new” idea being modeled and analyzed based upon the reference design; 6) the alternative design placed into the SE tool repository for comment and critique; 7) resulting changes, based upon a well-documented ESMD change control process resulting in a new reference design.  This RFI seeks comments in several requirements focus areas, as listed in the document, specifically addressing the reasonableness and comprehensiveness of the requirements. The method in which the requirements are addressed and satisfied should be provided. Additionally, the RFI seeks input on commercial off-the-shelf or in development solutions, to meet/fulfill the proposed requirements.  Information submitted to ESMD in response to this RFI will be treated as strictly proprietary unless otherwise indicated. No procurement is planned as a direct result of this Request for Information. This is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Failure to respond to this synopsis does not mean that a firm cannot respond to a solicitation at a later date.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  Interested offerors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit input for any/all of the 11 functional requirements focus areas discussed.	All documents shall be delivered in an electronic format using Microsoft Word Table or Microsoft Excel worksheet format.  See Attachment 1 for a template of the expected response format. Supplemental information may be provided in a narrative format using Microsoft Word with graphics, as appropriate. Font size should be no smaller than 12 point.   Responses shall be no longer than 8 pages in length including supporting graphics and additional back up material. Input should include the following as a minimum: For submitted responses, include: •	Submitter name, phone, email, and mail address •	Tool description •	Tool capabilities Key words that serve to identify important elements of the input should be highlighted for quick visibility. Technical questions regarding this RFI should be directed to: Terry Jackson (202) 358-0987 or tjackso1@hq.nasa.gov. Procurement related questions should be directed to: Rhett Herrera (202) 358-3633 or Rhett.A.Herrera@nasa.gov All responses to this notice shall be submitted to Rhett Herrera no later than 6 pm EST on March 2, 2005. Please reference NNT05ESMDL-ES in any response. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities home page is   http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=04	It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>The U. S. Census Bureau requests Design, Hardware and Software suggestions to modernize its current Computer Assisted Interviewing (CAPI) Mobile Computing Telecommunications (Polling) system.  The intent is to modernize the system to take advantage of new telecommunication tools and systems, to increase the speed of data transfer and minimize downtime to users.  We are interested in a system that allows for mixed-mode telecommunication transfers and allows for mixed devices to connect for data exchange (laptops, tablet PCs, PDAs).  The system must ensure sufficient redundancy to provide 24x7x365 availability to our mobile users.   High level requirements for the system are: 1. It must allow for Multiple Points of medium access such as broadband, wireless, LAN connectivity and asychronous (dial-up) for all users.  2. It must have a completely redundant and reliable instrastructure which accomodates the following: a. Full capacity telecommunications accessibility, 365 days per year X 24 hrs per day, b. uninterrupted telecommunications access during system maintenance activities, c. Must allow for a minimum of 7,500 mobile devices (laptops, tablet PCs, PDAs)  to be connected simultaneously, 
d. The system needs to be scalable, e. The system needs to have reporting capabilities. 3. Every mobile device/user will have some sort of email access. 4. Every mobile device/user will have restricted Internet access. 5. Data and physical security solutions must meet all NIST, NSA, DOC, and Census Bureau standards and regulations including but not limited to FIPS 140-2 and NIST Special Publication 800-63. 6. The system should be expandable. 7. Redundant site(s) must be located in different metropolitan areas. (Note: Currently the Census Bureau has over 15 facilities located across the Continental United States). Oerview of the Current System: The current CAPI Telecommunication (Polling) system supports communications between the Census Bureau Headquarters and our Field Representatives (FRs) that collect data for several time critical surveys that are of national importance. The Field staff is located throughout the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  Some of the FRs are located in remote areas that do not have access to the newer telecommunciations infrastructure.   The need to have a system that can accommodate these people is critical. 

The FRs currently connect to the Census Bureau Telecommunciations (Polling) system using laptop computers and PDAs equipped with 56Kbps modems.  When the FR connects, software updates are automatically sent to and installed on the FRs mobile device, and new work for the FR is sent to the device as a zipped encrypted file.  Completed work is then zipped, encrypted and transferred to the Census Bureau Headquarters system.  Once an FR initiates a transmission, no further action is required of them.  Currently the FR has the option to choose two types of tranmissions, one that is “Preset” to occur at a designated time each day, or an to transmit “immediately” meaning, at the time of making that selection.  The average file size currently transmitted is 1 mb, but has been as large as 4 mb (and will continue to rise.  The Census Bureau is interested in obtaining suggestions for this redesign from the industry.  The timing for release and use of the system would be late 2007 to early 2008.  Companies that plan to respond should send a mail message stating that they intend to provide information by February 25, 2005.  E-Mail messages should be sent to: patti.k.becker@census.gov.  Interested firms must submit information on their capabilities, design, hardware and software suggestions for the above described system no later than 3:30 pm EST on March 22, 2005. Please note: This REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)is for market research purposes only.  This RFI is NOT a formal solicitation.  The Census Bureau is not prepared to purchase any individual products at this time.  No contract will be awarded as a result of this notice.  No telephone inquiries will be answered.  All responses must be in writing via e-mail to patti.k.becker@census.gov or mailed to :  U. S. Census Bureau, Acquisition Division – FB#3, Room G-312, 4700 Silver Hill Road, Washington, DC 20233-1700, ATTN: Patti Becker.

<DESC>Robotic Lunar Exploration Program/Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Communication System Request for Information THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. Overview LRO requires communications to support tracking, telemetry and command (TT&C) as well as mission measurement data return.  To accomplish this LRO intends to employ S-Band for TT&C functions and Ka-Band for high rate measurement data.  Proximity relay is planned to enable mission cross-support at S-Band.   Requested Response The LRO mission requests that interested parties provide inputs and suggestions as to how best to achieve the communication goals of the LRO mission (and extend into the RLEP program).  Responses may include component or system level concepts including transceivers, software defined radios, transponders, modulators, SSPAs and TWTAs in S- and Ka-Bands in addition to passive components that enable LRO’s mission communications.  The project is interested in learning of individual component technologies as well as complete system concepts.   Cost and schedule are discriminators in LRO’s eventual selection of any solution, and so the project is mostly interested with responses that closely match or exceed LRO’s assumed requirements, however, the project is very interested in learning of potential technology developments that could benefit LRO, RLEP and the Agency.   In addition to the general topics discussed above, the LRO mission requests the following.  Interested parties do not have to respond to the following questions if they do not apply to their proposed component / technology / system. 1.	Discuss a minimum-cost, minimum-risk method of achieving the communication goals of LRO.  This may involve independent communication systems to support TT&C, high-rate and proximity relay.  Discuss the proposed architecture and components.  Provide ROM estimates for NRE and procurement costs as well as schedule estimates ARO.  Discuss expected mechanical, thermal, mass and power requirements of this solution. 2.	Discuss an in-flight reconfigurable method of achieving the communication goals of LRO.  This may involve independent systems to support TT&C, high-rate and proximity relay.	The systems must, however be adaptable and reconfigurable by software/firmware load on orbit.	LRO wishes to consider this option to understand the implications of building into LRO adaptability to support future technologies that may be developed as the program moves forward.  Discuss the proposed architecture and components.  Provide ROM estimates for NRE and procurement costs as well as schedule estimates ARO.	Discuss expected mechanical, thermal, mass and power requirements of this solution. 3.	Discuss a minimum hardware option that aims to combine the three primary communication functions into one system.  In-flight reconfigurability is again a goal of this option.  Discuss the proposed architecture and components.  Provide ROM estimates for NRE and procurement costs as well as schedule estimates ARO.  Discuss expected mechanical, thermal, mass and power requirements of this solution. 4.	Discuss any other methods, options or technologies you believe of benefit to the LRO and RLEP programs. Information also is sought from communication vendors on the following thermal considerations related to communication system technologies:  1.	Methods to minimize heater power. 2.	Methods to minimize thermal coupling of communication system to rest of the spacecraft. 3.	Approaches which simply thermal integration and qualification. Information submitted to GSFC in response to this RFI will be treated as strictly proprietary unless otherwise indicated.  No procurement is planned as a direct result of this Request for Information.  Information submitted in response to this Request for Information will be used for LRO and RLEP concept development activities.  Parties proposing concepts of interest to LRO and RLEP may be invited to submit more detailed information or to discuss their concepts further. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Technical questions should be directed to:  Jason Soloff at (301) 286-1368 or Jason.A.Soloff@nasa.gov.

<DESC>The US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Directorate of Procurement, is performing market research to identify potential sources of supply for a supplemental/replacement Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) suspension system for modified Special Operations Forces (SOF)  HMMWV’s.  Proposed systems are intended to replace stock suspension components to accommodate the wider range of gross vehicle weight requirements of USSOCOM modified HMMWV’s.  Proposed systems should be capable of operating effectively at a wide range of gross vehicle ranges, which will vary from 7500 Lbs to 13,500 Lbs (threshold), 7500 Lbs to 15,000 Lbs (objective).  Proposed system should be “bolt on-bolt off” compatible with stock components.  If limited modifications are required, vehicle must retain the ability to use Department of Defense stock components without other or additional modifications.  At a minimum the vehicle must retain the mobility of a stock HMMWV with increased mobility desired.  Also desire increased reliability and maintainability.  Request that interested parties respond with their company’s capabilities via brochures, company literature or any medium which will describe their company’s capabilities.  Potential sources should respond to this requirement via email to dethieg@socom.mil or siemietl@socom.mil.  Company literature should be mailed to USSOCOM SOAL-SP, Attn: PM FOSOV, 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB FL  33621.  Include your company name, CAGE code (if applicable) and contact info; small business status; and any other information about your company related to ground vehicle suspension systems.

REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKING FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO)
The following procedures are excerpted from Department Homeland Security Management Directive 11042 entitled ¡§Safeguarding Sensitive but Unlassified (For Official Use Only) Information¡¨ and shall be followed:

Marking

1.	Information designated as FOUO will be sufficiently marked so that persons having access to it are aware of its sensitivity and protection requirements.  The lack of FOUO markings on materials does not relieve the holder from safeguarding responsibilities.  Where the FOUO marking is not present on materials known by the holder to be FOUO, the holder of the material will protect it as FOUO.  Other sensitive information protected by statute or regulation, e.g., PCII and SSI, etc., will be marked in accordance with the applicable guidance for that type of information.  Information marked in accordance with the guidance provided for the type of information need not be additionally marked FOUO.

(a)	Prominently mark the bottom of the front cover, first page, title page, back cover and each individual page containing FOUO information with the caveat ¡§FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.¡¨

(b)	Materials containing specific types of FOUO may be further marked with the applicable caveat, e.g., ¡§LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE,¡¨ in order to alert the reader of the type of information conveyed.  Where the sensitivity of the information warrants additional access and dissemination restrictions, the originator may cite additional access and dissemination restrictions.  For example:  

WARNING: This document is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO).  It is to be controlled, stored, handled, transmitted, distributed, and disposed of in accordance with DHS policy relating to FOUO information.  This information shall not be distributed beyond the original addressees without prior authorization of the originator.

(c)	Materials being transmitted to recipients outside of DHS, for example, other federal agencies, state or local officials, etc. who may not be aware of what the FOUO caveat represents, shall include the following additional notice:

WARNING: This document is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO).  It contains information that may be exempt from public release under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).  It is to be controlled, stored, handled, transmitted, distributed, and disposed of in accordance with DHS policy relating to FOUO information and is not to be released to the public or other personnel who do not have a valid ¡§need-to-know¡¨ without prior approval of an authorized DHS official.  

(d)	Computer storage media, i.e., disks, tapes, removable drives, etc., containing FOUO information will be marked ¡§FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.¡¨  

(e)	Portions of a classified document, i.e., subjects, titles, paragraphs, and subparagraphs that contain only FOUO information will be marked with the abbreviation (FOUO).

(f)	Individual portion markings on a document that contains no other designation are not required.  

(g)	Designator or originator information and markings, downgrading instructions, and date/event markings are not required.

General Handling Procedures

Although FOUO is the DHS standard caveat for identifying sensitive unclassified information, some types of FOUO information may be more sensitive than others and thus warrant additional safeguarding measures beyond the minimum requirements established in this manual.  For example, certain types of information may be considered extremely sensitive based on the repercussions that could result should the information be released or compromised.  Such repercussions could be the loss of life or compromise of an informant or operation.  Additional control requirements may be added as necessary to afford appropriate protection to the information.  DHS employees, contractors, and detailees must use sound judgment coupled with an evaluation of the risks, vulnerabilities, and the potential damage to personnel or property as the basis for determining the need for safeguards in excess of the minimum requirements and protect the information accordingly.

1.	When removed from an authorized storage location and persons without a need-to-know are present, or where casual observation would reveal FOUO information to unauthorized persons, a ¡§FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY¡¨ cover sheet will be used to prevent unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure.

2.	When forwarding FOUO information, a FOUO cover sheet should be placed on top of the transmittal letter, memorandum or document.

3.	When receiving FOUO equivalent information from another government agency, handle in accordance with the guidance provided by the other government agency.  Where no guidance is provided, handle in accordance with the requirements of this directive.

<DESC>MARCORSYSCOM is seeking information regarding the capabilities of commercially available and/or Non-Developmental portable power sources. The current method of carrying batteries on a mission is burdensome, both in cube and weight, and requires a huge logistics tail. The risk of running out of battery power to operate the devices of modern warfare is too great to under estimate mission requirements.  Consequently, Marines often overload their packs with batteries.  The use of an Emergency Battery System, activated by non-potable or potable water, could potentially reduce the load on the Marine. An Emergency One-Time Use Battery System must be weight efficient, over 400 Watt Hrs/Kg (dry weight), low cost (under $100 for 250 Watt Hrs), provide 12-14 Volts DC nominal, and must not be considered a hazardous material for transportation or disposal purposes.  A long shelf life is highly desirable (greater than 5 years).

Firms, which have products with the above characteristics/capabilities, are invited to submit the following information within their Capability Statement: 1) Product summary, 2) Complete technical characteristics, 3) Pictures/drawings, 4) Unit price and 5) Corporate history. Responses will be reviewed to identify firms potentially capable of fulfilling the Governments requirements. Vendors are requested to submit their Capability Statement to the address below no later than 10 March 2005. This sources sought / Request For Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisition. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information requested. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. Responses to this RFI shall be mailed to Commanding General, MARCORSYSCOM, Attn: Attn: Gabrielle Trickett (Code GTES/EPS), 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134. For further information regarding this RFI or submission of materials, contact the Contracting Officer, Gabrielle Trickett at phone number: (703) 432-3616 or e-mail: gabrielle.trickett@usmc.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate a five-year Cost Reimbursement Type contract with Alpha Genesis, Inc. of Yemassee, South Carolina to continue breeding and maintenance of NIAID-owned Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) Indian Rhesus macaque and Cynomolgus macaque colonies.  The colonies, which were established for NIAID by Alpha Genesis, Inc., under Grant No.6- U01-AI-49916-05, produce SPF monkeys for the research efforts of the NIAID Non-human Primate Transplantation Cooperative Study Group (NHPCSG).  At present the strength of the colony is approximately 550 Cynomolgus macaques and 800 Indian Rhesus macaques with projected growth to 1500 monkeys by September 2005.  The Cynomolgus macaque breeding colony will achieve production maturity of approximately 175 SPF monkeys per year for research use by 2007 according to the current projections.  The Indian Rhesus macaque breeding colony is at colony maturity and will provide approximately 150 SPF research monkeys per year in 2005.   Alpha Genesis Inc. currently provides maintenance and SPF derivation for both the NIAID Cynomolgus and Indian Rhesus macaque breeding colonies; establishment of directed breeding  harems, based on MHC typing and detailed pedigree history and analysis; and specialized services and testing of monkeys for the NHPCSG researchers.

Specifications of the current colonies and facilities include: (1) SPF post-weaning derivation for Herpes B, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), Type D simian retrovirus (SRV), and simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV-1); (2) more than 65 carefully maintained social groups and harems ranging in size from 4 to 35 animals each; (3) annual colony mortality rate of  5-7% and infant mortality rate of <1%; (4) production  rates, based on births per all females of bearing age, of 78% for the Rhesus colony and 73% for the newly established Cynomolgus colony; (5) more than 39 corrals and field cages (80 by 80 feet each), all with individual attached heated back-up containment areas, and multiple 20 by 80 feet buildings with outside extension cribs and runs; 
(6) dedicated buildings for single housing of up to 100 monkeys; (7) two clinics for the colonies (SPF and conventional) dedicated to these colonies; (8) full AAALAC accreditation; and 
(9) monkeys for research are provided to the NHPCSG free of charge, except for shipping costs.

AUTHORITY: 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) and HHSAR 306.302-1 (a) (2) (ii). Data from preclinical (NHP) transplantation studies of novel therapeutics are of critical importance to the initiation of transplantation clinical trials.  This monkey resource, with directed breeding programs, is invaluable to these efforts of the NHPCSG.  Continued high production rates and supplies of these high quality monkeys are essential to meet the goals and milestones of these research efforts, therefore it is necessary to prevent loss of the monkeys and reduced breeding due to relocation stress. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, if there are responsible Sources who feel that they are capable of performing this requirement, they must respond within 45 days from the posting date of this announcement. See Numbered Note 22. No Collect calls will be accepted.




 
Potential Sources should demonstrate and document the following abilities:

1)	Relocation of all monkeys within 4 months, without disrupting routine provision of SPF monkeys from these colonies to NHPCSG researchers;
2)	Not exceed current colony mortality rate after relocation and out years (<5-7% per year);
3)	 Maintain 73-78% production rates and low infant mortality rate (<1% per year) throughout;
4)	Number,  quality, and size of housing and clinical facilities available for the colonies must be equivalent to, or greater than, those provided under the current grant as listed under “specifications #5, 6, 7 and 8” above and;
5)	Maintain established social groups from time of transport and maintain SPF status during and following shipment.

<SUBJECT>R -- Military Team Bass Fishing Tournament Sponsorship Opportunity
<DESC>The 15h Annual Military Team Bass Fishing Tournament sponsored by the Robins AFB 78th Services Division, Smith Community Center, will be held from May 1 through the 6, 2005. This event will be held at Lake Eufaula in Eufaula, AL. Last year we had over 145 teams competing in the fishing tournament giving us over 500 spectators for the week. The competing teams represented all five branches of the Armed Services and traveled from 31 different states. 
This year we anticipate maximum participation of two hundred teams. We would like to offer you the opportunity to play a part in this tournament by becoming a commercial sponsor. There are many different package levels to choose from for sponsorship. The package you choose determines the type of recognition you will receive. Some examples of the recognition your company may obtain are a banner hung during the entire tournament, company name and\or logo on the t-shirts, web-page and press release recognition just to name a few. We are also allowing sponsors to set up display tables during the week, which will include registration, the hospitality suite and weigh-in. We are looking for monetary or in-kind sponsorship from companies for trophies, t-shirts, door prizes, large and small, and goody bags. 
If, for some reason, you are unable to become a sponsor at this time you can still be a part of the tournament. Donations (any contributions under $500) are always welcome and will definitely help us to once again have a fist-class tournament. All donors will receive one time recognition on a special banner hung throughout the duration of the tournament.  
Would your company like to be a part of the DOD Team Bass Fishing Tournament for 2005?  If so, please contact Marisa Mammano no later than April 1, 2005 at (478) 926-6629 or (478) 926-5492.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Hardin Ridge Electrical Construction on the Hoosier National Forest in Indiana
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to award a sole source contract with the Utilities District of Western Indiana REMC for the removal of approximately 14,860 feet of existing privately-owned, above-ground utility lines and relocating them underground at the Hardin Ridge Recreation Area of the Hoosier National Forest in Monroe County, Indiana.  The Utilities District of Western Indiana REMC provides primary electrical service to the Hardin Ridge Recreation Area and private residences adjacent to the Recreation Area.  Most of the service is overhead lines through the timbered interior of the recreation area which are extremely difficult to maintain due to the topography.  The power lines will be relocated underground along the main entrance road at Hardin Ridge.  REMC would also remove all the disconnected power poles.  The Forest Service will be sharing the cost of the installation which will benefit both the Hoosier National Forest and the Utilities District of Western Indian REMC.  The REMC purchases their own materials and does their own installations.  Once completed the REMC will own and maintain the service.  The utility service is that of the Utilities District of Western Indian REMC.  The Forest Service cannot contract with others to install their service.  Approximate value of the work to be done by the REMC is under $100,000.00.

<SUBJECT>66--Millimeter Wave Radar
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Norden Millimeter, Placeville, CA.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center, Developmental Test Command, US Army Test and Evaluation Command.  The Subsystem Test & Analysis Branch, Redstone Technical Test Center has a requirement for a Millimeter Wave Radar Projection System.  There are many components in this system; including Ka Band Amplifiers and Switches.  This Millimeter Wave (MMW) Radar projection system will be integrated in the Advanced Multispectral Simulation, Test & Acceptance Resource (AMSTAR). The complete system will provide complex multi-channel MMW scenes to a MMW Radar seeker in real-time as a simulated missile flight is flown.   The system is a complex 4 channel dynamic precision system custom developed by multiple contract and government engineers under the direction of Redstone Technical Test Center and the Aviation and Missile RDEC (AMRDEC) System Simulation Development Directorate (SSDD).  The first copy of this system has been built and is being installed in the first AMSTAR test facility (Performance Bay 1).  This order is for parts that make up the second system to be installed in the second AMSTAR test facility (Production Bay 1).  It is the goal of the AMSTAR development team to directly duplicated systems from the first facility into the second.  This provides reduced development time, compatibility between systems, test duplication, easier configuration control and a reduced spare requirement. Norden Millimeter provides the only amplifiers and switches that are a direct match to our current system, both technically and physically; and only direct sales from the company are possible.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of development, documentation, engineering, and spare cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST February 23, 2005 will be considered by the Government.  POC:  Susan Lawson, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be e-mailed  to Susan Lawson at Susan.Lawson@mms.gov.

The SRS provides these services in multiple digital and analog formats.  The new facility will be primarily high definition with support for standard definition and NTSC.  Requirements: The SAA invites all qualified sources to respond to this sources sought notice.  The vendor must be located within the Washington DC Local Commuting Area (no more than 50 miles driving distance to the United States Capitol Building).  The vendor response to this sources sought notice shall specifically address the five evaluation criteria below.  The evaluation criteria for selection, listed in descending order of importance, are as follows: (1)Firm experience and past performance: The primary firm and sub-contractors must have specific experience, within the last five years, involving the turnkey design and construction of high definition broadcast grade facilities.  The projects shall be listed and include any other supplemental information necessary to address this criteria.  Firms are encouraged to provide any available documentation that would indicate their ability to complete these projects on time and within budget, their ability to respond to changing workload requirements and schedules, and the overall satisfaction of past customers with their work.  Responses must include complete and current contact information of past customers; the Senate will check references as necessary to evaluate past performance.  Experience and past performance will be evaluated on the basis of its breadth and depth, its similarity to the Senate project as well as the satisfaction of clients and overall quality of services represented by the projects described.  (2) Assignment of Personnel: The firm must identify principals and individuals to be assigned to work on projects under the contract.  Designated employees must have specific experience, within the last five years, with projects involving the design and construction of high definition broadcast grade facilities.  Personnel will be evaluated on the basis of the similarity of their experience to that expected to be required on work to be performed for the Senate and on the overall quality of their work as represented by the projects described.  (3) Specialized experience of design team members individually, and collectively as a team, in the design and installation of facilities; (4) Computer capabilities - AutoCAD 2000 system; Microsoft Word for Windows, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project; and (5) Location/proximity to the United States Capitol Building.  Failure to provide information on criteria 1 through 5 above may result in disqualification of the vendor from consideration.  The prequalification process will consist of two phases; this FEDBIZOPS announcement is for Phase One.  A Prequalification Evaluation Team will evaluate all responses to this notice to select those vendors who are qualified to participate in Phase Two.  Only the most qualified vendors will be invited to participate in Phase Two.  Vendors selected for Phase Two will be required to participate in a personal interview and make a technical presentation to the Prequalification Evaluation Team.  The Prequalification Evaluation Team will evaluate all vendors participating in Phase Two to select the most qualified vendors.  At the completion of Phase Two the SAA reserves the right to issue a solicitation for the relocation and digital modernization of the Senate Recording Studio only to the most qualified vendors.  Responses must contain Firm Information: (Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Telephone Number, Email address, DUNS Number and Tax ID Number).

Haddow at acquisitions@saa.senate.gov.  Response shall not exceed thirty (30) pages.  The subject line of the email message shall be SSN 2005-S-012 SRS Move and Digital Migration.  Access to information in any files attached to the response is the responsibility of the submitting party.  The SAA is not responsible for any failure to access information.  The information supplied in response to this sources sought notice will be used to pre-qualify firms that will be invited to submit proposals.  Firms responding to this sources sought notice and deemed qualified by the SAA will be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Only pre-qualified firms will be permitted to submit proposals.  If suitable responses are received from qualified sources, the SAA anticipates release of a solicitation in April 2005.  The Senate or the SAA will not be responsible for any costs for the preparation of responses to this announcement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT AND IS THE ONLY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SAA OR U.S. SENATE.

The incumbent shall serve as an Acquisition and Assistance Specialist responsible for providing the full range of services associated with USAID procurement.  Working under the technical and administrative oversight of the Contracting Officer, the incumbent will be expected to work primarily in accomplishing the specific tasks outlined below.

C. Major Duties and Responsibilities
	
The incumbent shall provide personal services as an Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) Specialist, providing a wide range of procurement support services to the client missions of the RSC/RCO. The incumbent will function as a member of an acquisition and assistance team that serves a wide geographic area, with great cultural and linguistic diversity, while performing a very broad range of acquisition and assistance actions.  The incumbent will have multiple country assignments and is expected to either possess or acquire the ability to manage the broadest array of acquisition and assistance support assignments, with a minimum of supervision. A comprehensive knowledge of the acquisition and assistance processes is required since little of the work involves repetitive items and work is assigned based on the project support needs of the cluster.  The Contractor must provide technical assistance necessary to execute a full range of procurement actions, including but not limited to the following:
 
1. Cost-reimbursement and fixed price contracts, task orders, delivery orders, GSA schedule awards, purchase orders, grants and cooperative agreements, U.S. Government Interagency Agreements, personal services contracts, and other agreements; 

2. Modifications to all of the above;

Contractual decisions and recommendations will be considered authoritative for all actions within his/her designated portfolio and authority.  He/she must be a recognized technical expert able to independently interact with high management entities to obtain advance approvals for critical actions.

1.	Provide programming support to enhance the 5 table structure of data extracted from MIS.  The data within CDR is in a 5 tale format to match the message format in MIS.  This includes:
a)	Add meta-knowledge to the data migrated from MIS to the CDR, CIRR and the new CRIS. Once this data is converted it is necessary to add knowledge to this data so that Vital Signs take the structure of Vital Signs, ADT take the structure of ADT data, Medication Administration takes the form of MAR administration, etc.
b)	Provide programming support to all loading of data from Extracted Data From MIS in the 5 Tables format to a Data Warehouse as well as into HL7 messages to be loaded into Institute CDRs.

c)	Enhance the 6 month cumulative report to include an appendix for each patients report containing only reference ranges for tests that result data exist for the patient.

3.	Provide access and consultation to the CDR for Institute Users. The CDR is a Sybase Based Database containing patient, laboratory and microbiology data.  Access is currently provided to users by providing views to the main database.  As Institutes request access, it is necessary to develop the database for the Institute, provide support and consultation on the use of the CDR.  

4.	Document and train staff in generating the 6 month lab cumulative summary. The generation of the 6 month lab cumulative summary takes two weeks and is composed of many manual steps.  

5.	Migrate the MRD Transcribed Reports to an Online Archival System. The Medical Executive Board and CC Department Heads were told that all medical reports will be available on-line.  A process for storing and providing access to old reports stored as MS Word documents is necessary.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: 

Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 
2100 Second Street, SW, 
Washington, D.C. 20593, 
Telephone:   (202) 267-2285, 
FAX: (202) 267-4011. 

The Request for Proposal number is HSCG89-05-R-6F9006 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 481212.  The small business sized standard is 1,500 employees.  The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  The Contractor shall re-fuel Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the three Areas of Operation (AOR), they are Valdez, Juneau and Kodiak .  This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  The National Voice Distress System Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter.  There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites usually includes the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  Normally full pickle barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the mountaintop by a helicopter rated for that load carrying capacity.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane to the 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks at a site are at maximum capacity or fuel gauge reads between 80-85%.  A typical tank is filled to maximum capacity between 80-85%.  Fuel quantity estimate is conservative and already adjusted for the seasonal temperature changes and altitude. All sites should be filled to capacity, if fuel is delivered within required timeframes.  The contractor shall provide for all services, materials and equipment, personnel, transportation and propane. Contractor shall record and document actual gallons of propane delivered to each site and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative within one week of work completion.

QUESTION & ANSWER, FEB. 9, 2005: 
QUESTION: If Naked Island starts 1 April, can Pt. Pigot also start 1 April to make the fueling more economical (i.e.: not mobilize resources twice for the same area).
 
ANSWER: No, the United States Coast Guard does not want to fuel Pigot in April 2005 because it is in a 12-13 month fueling cycle which allows fueling at the site in Aug-Sep, when no snow is present.
