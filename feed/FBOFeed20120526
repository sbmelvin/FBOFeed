<DESC>The Northern and Intermountain Regions of the US Forest Service anticipate awarding multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts for Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) work. Forest Service management direction includes emergency response, rehabilitation, and restoration of resources. More specifically, management includes the implementation of emergency and non-emergency land treatments to meet the objectives of protecting watershed values and land uses within watersheds. These emergency response, rehabilitation and restoration contracts include the use of proven effective land treatments to meet agency objectives. The land treatments that are part of these contracts are aerial-based applications of mulch (agricultural or wood) and/or plant seed. These are very common treatments that are used for BAER, watershed improvement, road maintenance and habitat improvement programs. Mulch applications have been found to be effective at reducing erosion and runoff on burned areas, construction sites, and other areas where a protective surface cover can lessen recovery time. Seeding has been found to be effective at reestablishing a vegetative cover to protect from erosion and runoff, increase soil stability through root development, and speed the recovery of desired vegetative plant communities.
<p>The success of emergency response, rehabilitation and restoration of watersheds relies on the ability to mobilize and implement expeditiously. The intent of these contracts is to meet objectives of protecting, rehabilitating, or restoring watersheds and other land resources.</p>
<p>The intent of this solicitation and any resultant contracts is to obtain Standard Category Type II or Type III helicopters fully operated by qualified and proficient personnel and equipped to meet the requirements of applying mulch and seed to burned areas.</p>
<p>Work under these contracts may include application of mulch and/or seed on contiguous land areas that are 10's to 1000's of acres in size depending on project needs. The work shall include aerial-based application. It may also include purchase and delivery of mulch and seed material that are to be used for emergency response, rehabilitation and restoration projects.</p>
<p>The work may occur within Regions 1 and/or 4 of the Forest Service. More specifically Region 1 and 4 National Forest Lands administered in the states of Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, California, Colorado, Washington, and Wyoming.</p>

Engineering, manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration changes. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.

listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Through a series of trainings and experiential site visits in 2011 and 2012, VISN 11 leadership recognizes the potential for positive organizational impact from the implementation of continuous process improvement (CPI) through the utilization of lean concepts and systems redesign.

The NCO intends to negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The ThedaCare Center for Healthcare Value is the only healthcare system with an organizational improvement/systems redesign model uniquely equivalent to VISN 11 that offers a customized on-site course to be given at six of seven VISN 11 VA Medical Centers.
