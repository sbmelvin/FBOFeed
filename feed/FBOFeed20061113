<DESC>SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - 554th ELECTRONIC SYSTEM WING & 643rd ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS SQUADRON - LEGACY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION CAPABILITY SOL:	N/A 1  DESCRIPTION This is an announcement of a Request for Information (RFI).  This RFI is issued for the purpose of conducting a market survey to identify potential sources of commercial off the shelf (COTS) products and associated services that support a rapid legacy system modernization tool to assess, document, transform, re-factor, and web-enable legacy computer systems.  These products must have a viable commercial presence in industry and should be in use in applications similar to the planned Air Force use.  This is not a solicitation.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  It should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not reimburse any costs for preparation or submittal of information in response to this RFI.  In addition, the Government will not pay for any costs associated with participation in subsequent demonstrations. 2  BACKGROUND INFORMATION The 554th Electronic System Wing (554 ELSW)  and the 643rd Electronic Systems Squadron (643 ELSS) are researching potential solutions to assess, transform, re-factor or re-engineer, and if desired, web-enable a wide variety of legacy systems with various computer programming languages and system databases, into modern, platform-independent object-oriented software systems. Migration solutions may include a single selected product capable of evolving to support all required migration capabilities or a suite of tools targeted for specific capabilities. The research is focused on discovering the potential for  leveraging existing commercial practices and technology to migrate existing government logistics  legacy systems and with little human involvement transform it to a modernized software application as well as discovering and learning about industry-leading integrators of such products.  Current scope of this research is for 554th ELSW logistics systems. However, this effort may be expanded to include migration of AF wide logistics and embedded software systems. 2.1	Legacy System Modernization Solution The concept of a legacy system modernization product and approach is to develop a highly automated approach to modernize aging legacy systems in a fraction of the time and cost needed by other alternatives. The product should pose minimal technical and schedule risks associated with the modernization process, while simultaneously reducing the development time of the project. The full modernization process should provide a fully documented, functional system that has no proprietary components and is in a state to be maintained and upgraded using modern tools and software workbenches. Partial modernization and system assessment capabilities should also be supported. The legacy system modernization product is expected to, at a minimum, provide the following capabilities: &#61607;  System assessment    o  Captures the legacy system's As Is state by extracting properties of the existing system's requirements, architecture, and design, and simultaneously generating detailed documentation of the system &#61607;  Full or partial system and database modernization    o  Provides migrated software that is n-tiered, web-enabled, testable at the unit level, and fully documented    o  Languages to be supported in the migration include but are not limited to:       &#61607;  Source          .  Source          .  Oracle Forms          .  COBOL          .  Fortran          .  Ada          .  ColdFusion          .  C          .  VB          .  PowerBuilder          .  Pascal          .  Jovial          .  JavaScript          .  Perl       &#61607;  Target          .  Java           .  J2EE          .  C++          .  C#          .  .NET    o  Database transformation options include but are not limited to:       &#61607;	Relational        &#61607;	Hierarchical        &#61607;	Object       &#61607;	XML  &#61607;  System refactoring    o  Refactors the migrated system to an improved system architecture that meets all functional and systemic application requirements. The refactoring process should ensure that the legacy application and database architecture and design were not carried over from the legacy system.    Provide additional services such as requirements documentation, generation of architecture and design documents and diagrams, and generation of test scripts and test reports.    To accomplish this exploration, the 554th ELSW and 643rd ELSS are  requesting information from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) vendors. 3  TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION The 554th ELSW and 643rd ELSS will conduct market analysis by reviewing vendor submitted legacy system modernization capabilities description documents. Content requirements and specifications are described below in the LEGACY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION CAPABILITIES DESCRIPTION CONTENT section. Any information submitted by respondents to this request for information is strictly voluntary and will be used only for the purpose of this analysis.  Proprietary and Confidential Information will not be accepted.  The 554th ELSW and 643rd ELSS believe that standard specifications and capabilities should be sufficient to respond.   If applicable, a set of COTS products may be described by a team of COTS vendors to provide fuller coverage of the requested information as detailed in the Legacy System Modernization Capabilities Description.   Responses are due NLT 1700 CDT 22 Dec 2006 with questions due within 10 working days after the date this announcement is posted on HERBB/FedBizOP.  All questions and responses must submit via email to Ms Tailee Tucker at tailee.tucker@gunter.af.mil consisting of a zip file containing the completed Legacy System Modernization Capabilities Description document in accordance with the instructions outlined in  paragraph 4, Legacy System Modernization Capabilities Description Content below.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Genesys Solutions LLC of Los Angeles, CA under N00039-07-R-0008 pursuant to the statutory authority of Title 10, U.S.C. Section 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source, as implemented by FAR 6.302- 1(a)(1).   It will be a single Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Fixed-Price and Time-and-Material Line Items, and a five year ordering period.  The anticipated award date is the second quarter of FY-2007. Genesys will provide organizational alignment expert consulting services and periodic alignment assessments to monitor progress and develop action plans for improvement in targeted areas.  Under the current sole source contract with Genesys N00039-04-C-2140, Genesys performed an initial alignment assessment which provided a baseline for future assessments.  The alignment assessment results are reported using the Navy Alignment Measurement Tracking System (NAMTS), a reporting tool that is proprietary to Genesys.  The follow-on contract will provide for additional assessments and consulting support using the same assessment tool and methodologies.  These assesments will measure changes in alignment, create a pattern of accountability for executing key initiatives, and identify areas requiring continuing leadership focus. Questions or requests for additional information must be in writing and e- mailed to sandra.jones@navy.mil.  Telephone requests will not be honored.   A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Number note:  22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD), China Lake CA intends to enter into negotiations to award a modification to an existing Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a period of five years on an other than full and open competition basis to TEAC Aerospace Technologies Inc. The government requires TEAC mission debriefing and network-based software and associated licenses in support of NAVAIR WD flight testing. The MDDS-4 Network Software/License (P/N 50328301-402) is the network enabled Data Debrief Software application that is used for a "four-source" debrief where the license to use the software is actually enabled for simultaneous/network users.  This mission debrief software variant of the existing TEAC Mission Data Debrief Software will provide video playback and analyisis support for many current and future F/A-18 and EA-18 aircraft testing, as well as the future production !  China Lake aircraft.  This software and license will also support the centralized software license for pilot debriefing and critical data analysis across the entire NAVAIR EA-18G SDD (System Development and Demonstration) Program. This requirement is limited to TEAC as they are the only source capable of maintaining the necessary commonality and compatibility of equipment.  The MDDS-4 network software is required to maintain commonality with both the existing TEAC recorder hardware as well as the production F/A-EA-18 units. This commonality between test aircraft debrief software and the fleet aircraft debrief software is essential to logistics support, data transfer, processing and training of flight test engineers and aircrew. Infrastructure for pilots debrief, data analysis, and secure network distribution is already in place and will be compatible with this equipment.  The minimum number of MDDS-4 Network-based Mission Debrief Software is 30; the maximum is 70.  Delivery!   of this contract line item number (CLIN) will be FOB destination to t he Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake, CA 30 days after receipt of order.

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Software Development and Integration Test Support. NASA Ames Research Center has been given the Agency charter to investigate the capabilities of very low cost spacecraft developed under a rapid schedule.  In order to do this, NASA Ames is exploring a class of microsatellite missions to the moon that leverage DoD experience in interceptors, responsive space and microsats. Based on the experience of NASA Ames personnel who led those DoD efforts, NASA Ames is investigating a series of lunar missions that use inexpensive launch vehicles (Falcon 1 and Minotaur V) launched 24 months or less after ATP with mission costs including launch vehicle of ~$100M. In order to meet this challenging schedule, we will build on previous DoD experience with flight heritage avionics and software methodologies. This task requires the contractor to have expertise in the area of flight software development for space applications including mission simulation, flight software autocoding, processor and hardware-in-the-loop testing.  The contractor must be able to leverage software development practices and software modules from previous space applications that have flown successfully such that the level of risk in terms of new development is minimized.    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. The NAICS Code is 541710. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Michigan State University, 212 Food Safety and Toxicology Building, East Lansing, MI 45824 to provide professional services to determine the similarity between rodent model and human gene responses to ambient air particles in the Detroit, Michigan air shed.  The Mechanistic Indicators of Childhood Asthma (MICA) Study requires the exposure protocols, procedures, and conditions used to expose rats to concentrated air particles in Detroit in 2004 and 2005. Michigan State University has a unique mobile air research laboratory that contains equipment for monitoring ambient air, inhalation exposure chambers and animal laboratory facilities.   The University has previously conducted short term animal exposures to concentrated air particles (CAP) in Detroit, Michigan during 2004 and 2005.  The studies included rat models that simulate human asthmatic responses.  Michigan State University is the only vendor that has conducted these types of studies, in this location, with the appropriate animal model and in the correct time frame.   Therefore,  EPA believes that Michigan State University is the only vendor qualified with the expertise capable of satisfying this requirement.  The circumstance permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" at this time.  The anticipated period of performance is 12 months.   All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Robin S. Harris (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC 27703 or email to harris.robin@epa.gov.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Diesel Retrofit Project in Pune, India.

The Pune Municipal Transport (PMT) has 1,050 buses:  300 are Euro-2; 129 are Euro-1, and the rest are pre-Euro.  These buses utilize Tata and Ashok-Leyland engines.  Two hundred of the pre-Euro buses will soon be replaced with Euro-2 buses.  Due to their short remaining life, pre-Euro buses are not expected to be included in the TA.  PMT rebuilds the engines every 300,000 km, and replaces the vehicles at about 1 million km.  The buses travel an average of 90,200 km/year, and usually last about 10-12 years.  Many of the Euro-1 buses in the fleet are close to the 300,000 km limit for reconditioning, which provides a good opportunity for retrofits.

Pune Municipal Corporation requires technical assistance to investigate and compare the costs and effectiveness of retrofitting a total of approximately 20-25 buses with diesel particulate filters and diesel oxidation catalysts, or other USEPA or CARB-verified retrofit technologies, and low sulfur diesel fuel.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $296,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.

Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00pm, December 28, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue a delivery order under N00019-05-G-0026 to The Boeing Company, Derivative Aircraft Programs Division, Seattle, Washington, on a sole source basis using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 commercial contracting procedures for the FAA certification, parts and retrofit installation of Advanced Blended Winglets into two (2) Navy C-40A aircraft.  The installation of the winglets shall be Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified by Supplemental Type Certificate STC 737-NG ST00830SE. The winglets provide minimum fuel savings of 4.5% over the current configuration without winglets.  As well as providing improvements in climb gradient, optimum cruise altitude and a reduction in exhaust emissions. Range on long missions (over 2000 NM) with a nominal cargo load of 5000 lbs is improved by a minimum of 150 NM. 

The C-40A is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified, commercial derivative cargo/transport aircraft that has been modified with Navy specified requirements which consist of cargo door, cargo handling system and passenger and/or cargo combination configuration. The original C-40A aircraft contract was competitively awarded to The Boeing Company in Fiscal Year 1997. The Boeing Company is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and is the only source for the C-40A aircraft. The order will be issued on an other than full and open competition basis based on the fact that The Boeing Company is the Original Equipment Manufacturer for the C-40A aircraft and as such is the only source of the technical data required to obtain FAA STC approval for the winglets. 

The anticipated award date of this order is on or about 30 November 2007.  No solicitation document exists. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis. Responses received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for a Binary Print Compare Utility that meets U.S. Government Section 508 compliance standards (Visually Impaired/Blind Accessibility).  This product needs to be fully Section 508 compliant, or data should be provided as to when should be fully Section 508 compliant.  The IRS requires that all interested vendors address how their product meets or will meet each of the technical standards listed under ?Subpart B -- Technical Standards 1194.21 or 1194.22   found at this site:   http://www.section508.gov/  (http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12#Software).  

Technical Requirements:

The Internal Revenue Service produces taxpayer notices in IBM Advanced Function Printing (AFP) format using several document composition tools, including Document Sciences Compuset, and IBM Elixir DesignPro Tools.  Taxpayer notices are currently produced on an IBM zSeries mainframe, running IBM z/OS operating system.

We have begun a multi-year effort to migrate taxpayer notice production to a new hardware platform: Sun Ultra Sparc running  Sun Solaris operating system.  Taxpayer notices will be produced on the Sun using the Document Sciences product xPression.

As we migrate the production of taxpayer notices from the IBM zSeries mainframe using legacy document composition tools to the new Sun environment utilizing Document Sciences xPression, we require a binary compare utility which will allow us to compare print files electronically, reporting differences between the files in an easily understandable format, or reporting that files have no differences.  The utility needs to provide the capability to "mask" differences, be able to compare a "Reference file"    and "Test file" of differing sizes, compare reference file and test file with differing encoding and/or byte ordering, compare AFP files with differing internal structures, and compare non-printable fields such as Tag Logical Elements (TLEs)

Below is a detailed explanation of each requirement: 

1.  Compare AFP files generated with the same or different composition tools on the same or different hosts (z/OS and  Solaris).  The table below summarizes possible combinations.  
Reference File created on Host / using Composition tool:
Test File created on: Host / using Composition tool
z/OS / legacy composition tools z/OS / legacy composition tools Solaris/ xPression Solaris/ xPression z/OS / mainframe composition tools Solaris / xPression Solaris / xPressionz/OS /mainframe composition tools

2.  Provide masking capabilities at the individual field, page, and document level to allow comparison of files with the ability for the user to exclude reporting on known differences.  For example, reference and test files being compared could be composed using  different fonts (arial versus helvetica) ,  different font types (outline versus raster), different font sizes (12 point versus 8 point),  or the reference file could contain a graphic image on the first page of each notice,  while the test file does not contain the graphic image.  We require the ability to exclude known differences from the reporting.

3.  Provide a method of synchronizing files, so that if the reference file and the test file contain differing numbers of records, they can be compared with an indication of which records occurred only on one file.   

4.  Compare files with differing internal structures (MO:DCA print streams)  This could be due to different structured fields or different MO:DCA triplets within a structured field. For example, the reference file contains a page segment referred to in an ?Include Page Segment? (IPS) structured field. In addition, for the reference file, the page segment is also mapped with a ?Map Page Segment? (MPS) structured field in the active environment group for that page.  The test file contains the same page segment referred to in an ?Include Page Segment? (IPS) structured field, but in the test file, the page segment is not mapped with a ?Map Page Segment ? (MPS) structured field.   The printed output looks identical.  We need to know that the rendered output is identical.  (see requirement six below for non-printable fields).
Please see the IBM document number SG31-6802-07
Data Streams and Object Architecture Mixed Object Document Content Architecture Reference for information on MO:DCA.  

5.  Compare print files with different encoding schemes (ASCII, EBCDIC, UNICODE UTF-8 and UTF-16, big-endian and little-endian byte ordering) performing the appropriate translations so that files produced on different platforms can be accurately compared. For example a reference file is created on z/OS with EBCDIC encoding with big-endian byte ordering, and the test file is created on a Sun Solaris 64-bit system with UTF-16LE.   

6. Tag Logical Elements (TLEs) if present in the print files being compared, must also be compared, and differences reported.

Statement of Need:

The purpose of this RFI is to determine if any vendors have a Binary Print Compare Utility that is Section 508 compliant and capable of fulfilling the technical requirements listed above.

Requested Response:

Your response must be limited to 5 pages.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<ARCHDATE>01152007
<CONTACT>Johnny Lee Coleman, 256-876-5334
<DESC>The following questions and answers are provided as clarifications: Question 1. Most shock resistant hard drives are in a 2.5 form factor, as they are geared to notebook installations, that being the most common place where shock resistance is beneficial.  The problem is that the maximum current size for a 2.5 hard drive i s closer to 100GB than 500GB. In addition, the request that it be able to operate at 20g while writing is completely in opposition to the way the industry addresses ruggedization of hard drives.  IBM, and Panasonic for their Toughbooks, use a system that h as a sensor in the notebook that can tell if the unit is off axis and therefore likely in the midst of a fall. This system actually parks the hard drive heads (meaning they do not read or write)in order to protect the data/platters/heads from damage. This is generally considered the most advanced system available for data protection on a portable hard drive. So, in order to achieve the 500GB size requrement, you need a 3.5 SATA Drive. AMCOM Answer: We are not seeking a ruggedized drive, rather a slightly shock resistant external drive assembly. The entire external assembly should be able to withstand a 20G shock for 8ms while writing to the drive. This shock resistance is a function of both the hard drive itself and,the actual drive mounting technologt utilized, and the design and construction of the external enclosure. Our market research indicates that this level of shock resistance is available in commercial-off-the shelf products. Question 2.  Concerning Requirment that the Internal Disk Drive Must be Manufactured by the Same Manufacturere as Drive Enclosure - Companies that manufacture the drives; have other companies manufacture the enclosures. The various companies that sell the external drive solutions, all support the solution as a whole, and do not consider the internal drive to be a separately covered by the original drive manufacturer.  This stipulation is far to general for anyone to meet without first understanding what the  solicitor's definition of manufacturer is. Do the employees who manufacture the enclosures need to be directly employed by the drive manufacturer? AMCOM Answer - We are seeking a commercial-off-the shelf product provided and supported by a single manufacturer. As an example: an offering from company XYZ (a manufacturer of external hard disk drive enclosures) who installs a hard disk drive manufacture d by company ABC is not acceptable.  We are not interested in securing the services of a system integrator, who will integrate various components.  Simply stated: If the external enclosure is labeled as a Maxtor, Seagate, Hitachi, IBM, Toshiba, Samsung, et c. product; then the disk drive internal to that enclosure must carry the same label. Our market research indicates that this requirement is met by several commercial-off-the-shelf product. Question 3 - Concerning Serial Number Requirements - There is no manufacturer of hard drives who offers anything like this.  There is no software vendor who has a ready to go product which can achieve this. To write a custom software to achieve this will b e costly, time consuming, and exposes the solicitor to the probability of having to buy the software from a third party developer, thus negating the unified support requirement. AMCOM Answer: Our market research indicates that manufacturers of the drive enclosures use precisely this type software in-house to track the relationship between the enclosure and the internal drive for warranty purposes. Although probably a slightly unus ual requirement, it is a requirement for this procurement due to the intended use of the external hard drive units and the necessity of tracking the location of the data to an actual disk drive serial number rather than just the serial number of the enclos ure containing that drive. Question 4 - How strict is the Firewire 800 requirement? AMCOM Answer - Firewire 800 is a mandatory requir ement for the external drive to interface with the computer system with the fastest interface currently available within that computer system.

<SOLNBR>OPM049-07-R-00004
<RESPDATE>112206
<CONTACT>Joy Christie, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-606-4215, Fax 202-606-3201, Email joy.christie@opm.gov
<DESC>THE FOLLOWING ARE ANSWERS TO ALL QUESTIONS THAT WERE SUBMITTED to the OPM office on the Courier Service requirement.              


 
1.  CLIN 0004 & 0005 is a single round trip service from the originating location to all the other locations and back to the originating location or is the service from the originating location to each location and back from each location to the originating location?

A.  CLIN 0001 would be the only CLIN charged under this contract on a daily basis.  CLIN 0001 starts in Boyers, PA and ends in Boyers for one complete round trip. CLINS 0002, 0003, 0004 and 005 are requested only by the COR and with the approval of the Contracting Officer on an as needed basis.          



2.  For us to properly determine the type of vehicles required for these runs, could you advise the kinds of cargo(s) to be handled, the estimated quantities per run, and how it is unitized? 

A. The usual freight from the Federal Investigative Service Division offices would be approximately (20) footlocker type trunks which are roughly (3) cubic feet each, locked, weighing approximately (40) pounds each, but could be as much as (100) pounds. The contents of the locker type trucks would consist of paper, magnetic tape, equipment, etc. Some freight from the Federal Investigative Service Division may also be in sealed boxes. The usual freight from the Center for Retirement and Insurance Services is estimated to be fifty (50) boxes or 100 cubic feet, which weigh an estimated (40) pounds each or 2,000 pounds in total for usual heavy shipping days. The workload/volume is subject to change with little notice. The Federal Investigative Service Division and Center for Retirement and Insurance Services will attempt to provide advance notice to the contractor.  


3.  The RFQ stipulates that it is the driver s responsibility to load and unload cargoes.  If the unitized freight is oversized/overweight, will there be handling equipment at the OPM facilities, or are the TVs required to have the necessary equipment?  Will there be dockworkers available to assist if required in these situations?

A.  It is anticipated that most cargo will be in lockboxes as outlined in question 2. OPM does not anticipate any overweight/ oversize freight beyond what it outlined in question 2. 


4.  Could the freight of the different CLINs be consolidated and handled by the same TV if it is able to do so?  Affirmatively, how would that affect (if it does) the invoicing?

A.  Refer to question #1, OPM anticipates that CLIN 0001 will be the only CLIN used on a daily basis.  
B.  If OPM decides to exercise the option to utilize CLIN 002 through 005 for special deliveries the contractor will invoice separately for that CLIN.


5.  We currently do not have any security clearances.  Aside from security clearances for the regular drivers who will be doing the runs, are our cover drivers and back office support staff also required to have one?  How do we apply, and how long does it normally take to secure these?  If our offer is determined to be the best value for the government, is it possible to secure temporary clearances while background investigations are proceeding?

A.  Anyone that would handle or have access to trucks and/or OPM material would need a security clearance.
B.  The awarded contractor would be given the appropriate case papers for personnel to complete.  
C.  The timeframe of investigations varies but interim clearances are granted if certain requirements are met.  These requirements as determined by OPM normally include favorable National Agency Checks.


6.  How often will these deliveries take place?

A.  Approximately 250 days excluding federal holidays; however, deliveries on a holiday may be required on occasion. This is outlined in synopsis/solicitation.
 

7.  What is involved in the pick-up and delivery of the materials?

A.  Refer to the Synopsis/solicitation.

 
8.  Are there any special requirements involved in the shipment of these materials?

A. The contractor will comply with all policies and procedures outline in the combined synopsis/solicitation along with modification 1 & 2.

 
9.  If this is to be a daily run, what are the daily timetables from departure to arrival?

A.  The contractor shall accomplish deliveries within the confines of the normal 	working hours for these facilities. The contractor will have discretion on the 	best feasible routes between facilities for on time deliveries and pickups subject to approval by OPM.  For additional details reference questions 13 and 14.
 
	
10.   Is the budget information available for this job?

 A.  No



11.  Are there any requirements that this company must meet in order to bid on this job (i.e. minority owned business, small disadvantaged business)?

A. This requirement is being requested under full and open competition.



12.  Will all of the stops be on one delivery route as specified in CLIN 0004, or will each stop be ran separate as in CLIN 0001-CLIN 0003? 

A.  CLIN 0001 would be the only CLIN charged under this contract on a daily basis.  CLIN 0001 starts in Boyers, PA and ends in Boyers for one complete round trip.

14.  What time will packages need to arrive at each location (Washington D.C.; Fort Meade, MD; and Pittsburgh, PA)?

A.   Boyers, PA to/from Washington, DC
	- The Contractor shall pick-up freight from both facilities in Boyers, PA at 4:00pm and deliver them to Washington, DC by 6:00am the following day.

If the vehicle and contents need to be stored for any period of time, the facility must meet NISPOM standards and be approved by OPM. 


15.   Just to make sure I understand CLIN 0006 about Fuel Charges.  I need to multiply the total mileage for each CLIN by the number of trips, and then I need to divide by the fuel mileage of the vehicle to determine the amount of fuel subject to increases/decreases in gas/diesel prices? 

A.  That is correct. 


16.  I checked for abbreviations, but I could not find EPA anywhere.   What does "subject to EPA" mean?

The contents of the locker type trucks would consist of paper, magnetic tape, equipment, etc. Some freight from the Federal Investigative Service Division may also be in sealed boxes. The usual freight from the Center for Retirement and Insurance Services is estimated to be fifty (50) boxes or 100 cubic feet, which weigh an estimated (40) pounds each or 2,000 pounds in total for usual heavy shipping days. The workload/volume is subject to change with little notice. The Federal Investigative Service Division and Center for Retirement and Insurance Services will attempt to provide advance notice to the contractor.

A. The contractor should figure that the vehicle should be specific to the load estimates outlined in question 2.


19.  All of our employees have undergone background checks.  Do we need to send copies of the background check and identification cards? 

A.  The awarded contractor will be provided the necessary information. The OPM Contractor Access Branch would request the investigation and would verify that previous investigations meet OPM requirements.  If they meet OPM requirements they would be granted access but if not they would undergo the BI process.


20.  Is OPM expecting a detailed proposal? Or can we just submit the pricing to qualify for consideration?  

A.   A  TECHNICAL  AND  COST  PROPOSAL  ARE  REQUIRED.


21.  Does the round trip service start and end from each location, or does it start at 1137 Branchton Road Boyers, PA, going on to the next two locations and ending back at 1137 Branchton Road?  

A. The round trip starts in Boyers, PA and ends in Boyers, PA.

23.  What is the estimated number of pieces and weight being transported each day?

A. The usual freight from the Federal Investigative Service Division offices would be approximately (20) footlocker type trunks which are roughly (3) cubic feet each, locked, weighing approximately (40) pounds each, but could be as much as (100) pounds. The contents of the locker type trucks would consist of paper, magnetic tape, equipment, etc. Some freight from the Federal Investigative Service Division may also be in sealed boxes. The usual freight from the Center for Retirement and Insurance Services is estimated to be fifty (50) boxes or 100 cubic feet, which weigh an estimated (40) pounds each or 2,000 pounds in total for usual heavy shipping days. The workload/volume is subject to change with little notice. The Federal Investigative Service Division and Center for Retirement and Insurance Services will attempt to provide advance notice to the contractor.  


24.   What are the exact holidays when the deliveries would not be made? 

A.   Approximately 250 days excluding federal holidays; however, deliveries on a holiday may be required on occasion. This is outlined in synopsis/solicitation.



25.   Could you clarify CLIN 0001? How is this CLIN different from CLIN 0002 & 3?

A. CLIN 0001 would be the only CLIN charged under this contract on a daily basis.  CLIN 0001 starts in Boyers, PA and ends in Boyers for one complete round trip. CLINS 0002, 0003, 0004 and 005 are requested only by the COR and with the approval of the Contracting Officer on an as needed basis.



26.  Could you clarify CLIN 0005? The 10 annual trips would be to Pittsburgh Telecenter from which locations?

A.   CLIN 0005 would be special request by CIRS.  This would be from Boyers, PA to Pittsburgh, PA and then back to Boyers, PA.


27.   What is the estimated amount of time the driver would expect to be loading and unloading at each location? 

A.   There is no historical data but OPM estimates it will take approximately 1 hour.


28.   Should additional waiting time be allowed for due to security measures at each location, and if so, how much per location?

A.  No historical data can be provided. 


29.	Who is the incumbent and what is the current price per mile for this contract currently?

A.  The incumbent is Iron Mountain and Runners, Inc. Unit pricing is proprietary and can not be provided.  


30.	What is the anticipated lead time to obtain an OPM Clearance on a prospective driver?

A. OPM cannot clear someone for this position to EOD until a minimum of the NACs and PRSI are favorably adjudicated.  On occasion, OPM has been able to grant interim access within 6 to 8 weeks after the scheduling of the investigation.  The timeframe is dependent on the timely receipt of NAC responses and the individual s background which are beyond OPM s control.  


31.	Will OPM issue an interim clearance so that work can begin shortly after contract award?

A. OPM will issue interim access at the point noted above if they can be favorably adjudicated for interim access at that point.  If not, OPM may have to wait until the case is closed pending.  Rarely does OPM have to wait until the case is complete but could be required if issues are present that require resolution.

<SUBJECT>A--Sources Sought - Development and Design of a Passive Aerosol Sampler Shelter
<SOLNBR>RFQ-RT-07-00022
<RESPDATE>112706
<ARCHDATE>12272006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Rebecca Clausen, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3002
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS MODIFICATION IS TO MAKE FURTHER MINOR CHANGES TO THE WORK AS DESCRIBED BELOW.  DUE TO THE CHANGES MADE IN THIS AND THE PRIOR SYNOPSIS MODIFICATION, THE DUE-DATE FOR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS IS EXTENDED UNTIL NOVEMBER 27, 2006. The purpose of this synopsis is to conduct  a market search for businesses or other organizations with the demonstrated capability to design and test a shelter that isolates a passive aerosol sampler for particulate matter (PM) from wind and precipitation and conduct a field evaluation of the sheltered passive sampler.  The US EPA's  National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) is currently conducting field evaluations of a passive aerosol sampler for particulate matter (PM). The Wagner-Leith passive sampler (Wagner and Leith, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c) shows potential for assessing PM exposure because it can be operated without a  power source and can be miniaturized, making their deployment at multiple locations easy and cost-effective. Initial tests of the passive sampler have shown mixed results in terms of the sampler's ability to measure ambient mass concentrations with acceptable accuracy and precision. Different rain  shelter designs for the passive sampler have been used in these initial field tests and may account in part for observed differences between passive and actively-measured mass concentrations. The contractor shall:   (1) Design and test a shelter that isolates the passive sampler from wind and  precipitation. The ideal shelter is one that affords protection from most precipitation events, minimally affects particle deposition velocity, and is inexpensive. (The goal is to keep the cost of the shelter less than the passive sampler which is currently about $45).  The performance of the  shelter in terms of its impact on the accuracy of the passive sampler PM measurements must be characterized over a range of wind speeds encountered in ambient monitoring. The contractor shall conduct wind tunnel tests at 0, 2, 8, and 24 km/hr on a passive sampler protected by a candidate  shelter(s). Using optical or electron microscopy and particle analysis software, the contractor shall estimate the PM10-2.5 concentrations in the wind tunnel experiments using a calculation spreadsheet provided by the EPA. PM10-2.5 estimated with the sheltered passive sampler(s) will be compared to  that measured with a collocated dichotomous sampler and a collocated unsheltered passive sampler. (The deposition model developed by Wagner and Leith to estimate mass concentrations from passive samplers was empirically based on tests conducted with unsheltered passive samplers. The unsheltered  passive sampler is therefore expected to yield the best agreement with active samplers). Three replicate sheltered samplers will be exposed at each wind speed to assess precision. The proposed shelter should ideally shield the passive sampler from direct moisture during precipitation events. Three  sheltered passive samplers will be placed outdoors in an exposed location and exposed to a minimum of three (but as many as possible) rain or snow precipitation events. The samplers will be visually inspected for the presence of moisture during and after each precipitation event. Inspection results  will be recorded in a log along with notes on relevant weather conditions such as fog, high winds, horizontal rain, heavy downpour, etc. At the conclusion of these tests, it may be necessary to examine the samplers by microscopy in order to assess the integrity of the samplers. If requested, these  samples shall be made available to the EPA for analysis; (2) Conduct a field evaluation of the sheltered passive sampler. Using the shelter developed in Task 1 and the passive samplers  the contractor shall monitor PM10-2.5 for a five-day exposure period at an ambient monitoring site equipped with  a dichot sampler to provide a reference PM10-2.5 concentration and a wind speed monitor providing hourly wind speed for the 5-day monitoring period. Three sheltered and 2 unsheltered passive samplers will be exposed in order to assess precision. (It is understood that precipitation during the 5-day  field test may invalidate the unsheltered sampler results). The contractor shall repeat the 5-day field test detailed above a second and third time. Using optical or electron microscopy and particle analysis software, the contractor shall estimate the PM10-2.5 concentrations from the sheltered and  unsheltered passive samplers. Passive sampler PM10-2.5 mass will be linearly regressed against PM10-2.5 mass measured with the dichotomous sampler. The accuracy and precision of the sheltered and unsheltered passive samplers for PM10-2.5 mass will be determined by comparison with the dichot sampler  results.  The EPA is requesting capability statements in response to this synopsis.  The statement should detail your organization's experience with this type of sampler and with shelters for passive aerosol samplers.  The capability statement should also include your organization's size  determination.  To be considered a small business, this procurement will utilize NAICS code 541710 "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences" with a size standard of 500 employees or less. The information submitted will be evaluated and used to determine what sources  can provide the services, and whether or not this procurement may be set aside for small businesses.  Otherwise, this procurement will be subject to full and open competition.  The US Environmental Protection Agency, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park NC intends to award a purchase  order for the above services.  All capability statements are due by 12:00 p.m. ET on November 27, 2006.

<DESC>Amendment 0008 has additional questions that were asked. 1.Previously we pointed out to the USG that we had been provided DRAFT  ECPR06J2039 undated which changes the paint finish to the universal paint  formortars. The recently released package did not include the draft ECP  R06J2039. Are we to ignore the draft ECP and not include the universal mortar  paint? Answer:  The draft ECP R06J2039 regarding the change to paint finish  applies to this procurement. 2.	Previously we questioned the USG if the basic quantity of 12,000 units  of each [i.e. CLIN 0001AB and 0002AB] was to be delivered all at once. It  appears from the released package that the 12,000 is to be delivered all at  once. However the released package has added new confusion. The new revised  schedule now provided in Attachment  J1 now shows Clin 0001AB as delivery date  = "6 months AOA"  and  Clin 0002AB shows delivery date = "6 months AOA" . AOA  is footnoted to be "After Option Award". Thus from the footnote it now appears  that instead of the 12,000 being part of the basic award quantity, the 12,000  is now an option. If that is correct when would the USG plan on exercising  this option quantity? If this is wrong and it is still part of the basic  award, then Amendment J1 needs to be changed to "ACA".   Answer:  There was a  typed error and the zip file has been corrected. 3.	We had asked other questions [such as: adding in the small business  progress payment clause] that was not addresses in the released package. Are  more answers forthcoming? Answer: This clause can be added at time of award. 4.	Will there be a formal amendment to the solicitation incorporating the  released amendments A thru J1 into the W15QKN-06-R-0323 solicitation? Answer -  The amendment that was issued in Proc-Net is the formal amendment. 5.  There are a few parts on the main drawing that i can't find anywhere in the  contract.. 6-Spacer felt 9327877-3, cardboard 9327880, and Protective dust  plug 12630586. Please let me know where i can find the drawings or  descriptions for those parts. Answer - These drawings are not required for  this solicitation. They are for LAP only. 6.  Whoever answered question # 26, answered it incorrectly. The 1.13" max.  diameter has nothing to do with a chamfer, this dimension should not be on  drawing 9349624 as it does not apply to cones that do not get painted. This  same dimension is on drawing 9327836, this is the M853A1/M816 tail cone. This  same dimension references note 7, which states the following surfaces must not  receive paint G. 1.13" max diameter of face small end.  Please have someone clarify this so other potential contractors are not mislead.  Answer - DRAWING  9349624  CONE - TAIL  for 81mm M819 Mortar 1.  Remove the 1.13 MIN Diameter callout on the face small end of the Tail Cone 2.  Move the callout for DATUM  -C- from this 1.13 MIN callout to the 0.003  perpendicularity (WRT Datum  -D-) callout in Zone D-6 of the drawing (the face  of the small end of the Tail Cone). 3.  Delete the True Position Callout  attached to the 1.13 MIN Diameter (0.010  inch WRT Datum  -D- ).

<DESC>The following questions from industry have been received: Q1) First, what limits are intended for the fuze on the outgoing ordnance, in terms of g-forces and volume?  A1)The maximum g-force would be 600 G.  The max volum would be 4 inches in  length with a 4 to 5 inch diameter.   Q2) I believe you would gather better data if you indicated what munitions you  are contemplating outfitting:  tank shells? .50 rounds? mortar shells?   A2) The munition is a rocket propelled counter munition. Q3) Is the proximity fuze supposed to work stand-alone, or can it be tied to a ladar system fixed at the emplacement being defended?   A3)  The soultion is up to the individual offeror.  The following may help in  your decision; the closing velocity for the countermunition and the threat as they approach each other can be up 2300 m/s, and the radial distance between threat and countermunition can be up to 4 meters.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to identify potential sources and products capable of enabling the public to receive and utilize NWS essential weather information.  It will allow the NWS to determine the interest of prospective manufacturers in designing, constructing and marketing systems for the reception of the Emergency Managers Weather Information (EMWIN) datastream or for software to make that information more valuable to EMWIN users.  The EMWIN satellite broadcast in its present form through the NOAA Geostationary Orbital Environmental Satellites (GOES) must undergo a change when the new generation of satellites is placed into service sometime on or before 2011.  Existing EMWIN receiving systems must be adapted or replaced to make the transition to the new satellite broadcast.  The NWS wishes to identify and inform a community of vendors who have an interest in marketing low cost and reliable products capable of accommodating the transition.  Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government??s need are invited to submit an affirmative response.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including technical information sufficient to permit agency analysis.
This RFI is issued by NWS solely for obtaining information and planning and does not constitute a solicitation.  Proprietary information must not be submitted and will not be accepted by NWS.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.202 (e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Furthermore, no basis for claims against NWS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or NWS??s use of such information.  Affirmative responses should be submitted on or before December 04, 2006 via E-Mail to emwin.systems@noaa.gov  No telephone calls please.

	     BACKGROUND ?V 
What is EMWIN? ?V The EMWIN system is a popular dissemination system providing a serial bit stream containing timely watches, warnings, forecasts, hydro-meteorological products, graphics and satellite imagery. The EMWIN data stream is prioritized to meet the needs of emergency managers. EMWIN uses NOAA??s GOES satellites and economical receive systems to disseminate and process this bit stream. L-band Satellite broadcast is accomplished via GOES-East and GOES-West and also rebroadcast in Pacific via PeaceSat.  In addition to L-band satellite broadcast, portions of the EMWIN data stream are also rebroadcast via VHF radio, in certain areas, and via the internet in its entirety via internet push technology.  Additional information may be found at http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/index.htm.
EMWIN Satellite Broadcast - The current EMWIN broadcast modulation is Dual Frequency Shift Keying (DFSK) at a user data rate of 9.6 kbps.  The service is transmitted from the GOES satellites using an L-band down-link frequency at 1690.725 MHz.  Additional information may be found at the following address:  http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/WINSAT.HTM
What must change? - Changes in the next series of GOES satellites, the GOES-N thru P constellation, have necessitated development of a service to be offered as a replacement and upgrade to the existing broadcast.  All current EMWIN users will need to migrate to newer technologies due to frequency, power and modulation changes.  In addition, EMWIN users and vendors have also stressed the importance of increasing the EMWIN data rate and keeping the cost of the GOES-N transition as low as possible.

EMWIN System Design & Specifications ?V Working with NESDIS, the NWS has developed a system design and specifications for the use of prospective vendors.   The next generation broadcast, EMWIN-N is a digital direct broadcast service with a frequency of 1692.7MHz.   The broadcast will be offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) modulation and convolutional rate 1/2 plus Reed Solomon forward error correction for additional gain.  The user data rate will be 19.2 kbps.  Details of the design and specification are now available at the following link:  http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc.  
Proof-of-Concept Development ?V To demonstrate the feasibility of a receiving system capable of meeting the new EMWIN system design, NESDIS has developed and constructed a proof-of-concept model system using hardware implementation for the intermediate-frequency (IF) conversion and a software-defined radio scheme for the demodulation.  Detailed information on the proof-of-concept design may be found within the specification at http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc.  It is the intent of NWS to make the Demodulation and Decoding software and the dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that were developed available to the public at no charge.  The software may be downloaded at http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/EMWIN-N%20OQPSK%20software.htm.  Vendors are free to develop any alternative scheme which meets the system design and specification criteria.
GOES-N Satellite ?V The proof-of-concept model has been successfully tested using the GOES-N satellite.   The results of these tests are posted on
http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWINtstReptGOES-N.doc.  An EMWIN-N test broadcast will be available via the GOES-N satellite during the satellite test period which will last until approximately December 1, 2006.  After completion of the check-out of the GOES-N satellite, it will be placed in storage until required to replace the generation of GOES satellites still in service.  These older satellites will be replaced by the new generation on or before 2011, depending upon fuel consumption, premature failure or demand for capabilities only present in the new satellites.  Before being placed into operational service, the GOES-N satellite will be activated each year for a test period.
  
          INVITATION 
 Vendors who have an interest in submitting a capability statement or information please E-Mail to emwin.systems@noaa.gov.	     E-mails will be used to develop a mailing list to be used by the NWS in disseminating additional information on EMWIN and the GOES satellite evolution as part of a list of those invited to participate in an EMWIN  RFI workshop to be held in Silver Spring, MD on December 11, 2006.  E-mail 		      responses should include the following information:
?X	Brief description of firm and current similar product lines
?X	Firm??s URL
?X	Any questions
?X	Expression of interest in being on a mailing list and possible participation in a forthcoming workshop at Silver Spring, MD on December 11, 2006.
o	If possible, please submit before December 4, 2006.
o	An additional RFI workshop may be held in January, 2007.
o	Vendors who market EMWIN related products will be identified on a list of vendors posted on the EMWIN web site but without any endorsement by NWS.

Software will be rated by ability to meet the mission (J6N team), user friendliness (assembled user team), ability to provide future support (based on history of use in industry) as well as price per unit. 


 
   
OVERALL THE BUNDLED PACKAGE MUST INCLUDE:

?	Inclusive in the procurement must be all software maintenance and upgrades for 5 additional follow on years. (1 year plus 5 follow on). Software maintenance must include upgrades to ensure compatibility with latest upgrades, patches and changes in windows operating system architecture, security patches as proscribed by DOD/DLA through their various CERT and security functions, the finding of bugs and errors and minor changes or upgrades to meet possible changes. 

?	The software package must have the ability to store in a configuration file or in the Windows register the specific configurations for each of the associated programs. If possible that configuration should be user unalterable. 

?	The software must supply the ability to turn on or off and supply in the configurations SSL version 3 or higher encryption and have the ability to toggle  on or off in the configuration the Strict Server Authentication (SSL).  DES3 encryption or higher preferred. The encryption must also apply to the main frame print feature as well as the TN3270/TN3270E emulator. The LPD print server is not required to be encrypted.

?	The software package TN3270/TN3270E display emulator must have a embedded macro record and playback language/feature as well as SCRIPT language processor and editor similar to BLUEZONE and RUMBA. The script language processor must use a variant of Visual Basic or VB Script.  

?	Be capable of reading and utilizing the Department of Defense Common Access Card (CAC) for a login and digital signature for logon to DISA mainframes and to Department of Defense and DLA standards. 
 
FEATURES (TN3270/TN3270E DISPLAY): 

?	The TN3270E configuration must have the ability to turn toggle on (full industry compliance TN3270E verses TN3270) or off.  

?	The configuration must have the ability to request a specific VTAM/LU/Device name from the mainframe or leave it blank. 

?	 Must have the ability to set screen and transmission timeouts (Commonly called connect/ connection timeouts (T1 & T2) as well as retry times and times before retry parameters. 

?	The host enterable and must be either an IP address or a URL convertible to an IP address with the normal DNS process.  The Internet port must be enterable and variable from default 23 to any legitimate higher port number.  

?	The TN3270 screen must have the ability to store, save the configuration in a protected file or register.  

?	The user interfaced (screen) must have configurable the screen fonts, screen size,  back ground, cursor (blinking, blinking block, crosshairs) and character color.  The mouse must be able to point inside the screen and somewhere at the bottom of the screen must be the screen grid location of the cursor (24X80 screen). The screen must have a standard windows  highlight, cut and paste feature, that allows screen data to be cut and pasted into other windows hosted documents and emails. 

?	Must have the ability to use extraneous keys common to an IBM mainframe operations (F1 to PF24, thorough combination keys).  A key remapping ability is required, with the changes saved to the protected configuration file or register. 

?	Must have the ability to screen print and screen capture through the normal windows screen print and capture facilities found in windows XP hosted products. 

?	A on line or on network HELP facility is required to provide for simple explanations for user problems before they are elevated. 
 

FEATURES (LPD Print Server): 

?	Included must be the industry standard software print server the same as the Rumba TCPIP Print Server or the Bluezone TCP-IP Printer Server that operates in a Windows background process, monitors the incoming communications ports (Ethernet cards and when applicable 802.11b/g internal WiFi cards) for LPD print traffic.  When LPD traffic to that IP address is received by the print server software, it is routed to a windows designated printer as industry standard designator RAW and printed on that printer.  

?	The print server software must have the ability to save in a configuration file the specific queue definitions. The queue definitions are based on the LPD print queue name and can be linked and printed on a specific windows printer the same as Rumba TCPIP Print Server or Bluezone TCP-IP Print Server do now. 

?	The ability to auto start or start up from the windows start up directory and to run minimized or in the windows tray is required. The intent is to operate LPD printers which appear to be connected to the mainframe application as invisible to the user working on the TN3270/TN3270E display. 

?	 Also required is the ability to alter the TCP/IP port from the standard for LPD print (515) to any other legitimate TCPIP port or LPD to that port and the ability to over ride the windows printer designation for fonts (so print traffic can be routed to the correct printer RAW, unaltered from the mainframe print driver, eliminating any chance of a CR/LF/FF that may disrupt graphics (PCL) traffic). 

?	The software print server must also have an embedded translation table that follows general industry standards that allow specific character translations from ASCII to ASCII (swap a single character with another).  The purpose of this ability is to ensure special print characters that may not be generated by a mainframe program can be converted back to the correct character and print correctly and successfully. 

?	The ability to capture a data stream and place it into a windows file with a dynamically generated name is required. 

?	A log of print jobs received is required. 




 

FEATURES (Mainframe Print):   

?	We have a requirement for a bundled product that operates same as NET Manage Mainframe Print or Seagull Software Blue Zone Mainframe Printer.  The intent is to translate EBCDIC (LU1 and LU3-SNA) print stream from a mainframe print system, VPS (VTAM PRINTER SUPPORT by Levi, Ray and Shoop) to ASCII for printing on a windows defined print queue.  

?	The ability to provide in addition to the EBCDIC to ASCII translation a separate or additional translation table that provides the ability to alter character mapping.  The purpose is ensure characters that are difficult to pass through a defined SNA network can print correctly on the local windows defined printer.  A mainframe printer translation table will provide for some minor translations, a local translation table will provide for the translation back. 

?	 The main frame print software must have the ability to save in a configuration file the specific queue definitions. The queue definitions are based on a linkage to the LU printer name on the mainframe and a specific windows printer the same as Rumba Main Frame Printer or Bluezone Mainframe Printer  do now. 

?	The ability to auto start or start up from the windows start up directory and to run minimized or in the windows tray or as a back ground process is required.  The ability to toggle auto connect, auto disconnect and exit on disconnect is also required. 

?	The ability to define the destination name (Host) by either IP address or URL, define the specific port to pass the print traffic through, a connection time out and auto reconnect similar to the TN3270/TN3270E display portion.  The ability to request a printer document name is also required.  A toggle to use Secure Socket encryption and a toggle to use or not use strict server authentication is required. 

?	The ability to pass data through unaltered except for EBCDIC to ASCII and special translation table to the associated windows printer is required.  No extra fonts, carriage control, pagination or special characters are to be added, unless specifically requested in the setups. 

?	The ability to capture a data stream and place it into a windows file with a dynamically generated name is required. 

?	A log of print jobs received is required. 





If an actual procurement is made, the successful vendor must before hand submit at least 15 copies of their software for evaluation.  The evaluation process will consist of  3 parts: 

?	Technical review to assure the product meets the mission and technical functionality. 

?	An environmental test of a panel of DSS users for functionality.  Products will be graded on applicability, user friendliness and ease of use. 

?	Because of product maintenance and the on going upgrades and patches of operating systems, it is important that a successful vendor have a history of customers service and performance.  It is expected that references to customers with a large customer base will be supplied.

<DESC>Provide A/E Services for Project #692-332, entitled "Replace Dom Bldg. 217 I" at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center &amp; Clinics (SORCC), White City, Oregon.  Project involves the design for the final phase of this bed building demolition and replacement.  This work will include the design for the demolition and the replacement of the existing bed building.  The work will include, but is not necessarily limited to: (1) The demolition of existing building structure (B217), and related connecting corridor space back to Building 218.  There will be some of the demolition/deconstruction work done through other means.  The demolition design will not include environmental surveys for asbestos and lead and any related environmental drawing design work.  The SORCC will be contracting out for another A/E services to conduct environmental surveys and to prepare an environmental removal contract.  The SORCC will also be conducting in-house deconstruction efforts in FY08 to remove doors, windows, sidewalks, interior, non-load bearing walls, electrical, plumbing and others.  This A/E design project will involve preparing plans for removal of utilities, erosion control and the building structure (core); and design a new single story inpatient bed building of approximately 15,000 GSF (GSF does not include the connecting corridor) that will be constructed on site.  The new building will be predominantly bed space to accommodate approximately 50 beds.  This new building is the second of four new buildings and the first two buildings (B215/216) set the design schematic for all of these buildings.  The A/E may use the Government furnished AutoCAD drawings and specifications from the previous buildings design to minimize re-design, maximize productivity and to maintain the architectural, interior designs (all aspects unless otherwise noted including but not limited to: all finishes and room configuration and placement); many of the structural, electrical, fire alarm and suppression features.  The A/E may use the typical drawing details, the building layout for this design and the applicable specifications.  This does not relieve the A/E from providing the Government with an accurate and clear design.  The A/E shall evaluate the previous building designs in specific areas of (a) Landscaping - no vehicular access to this building is required; (b) Mechanical-HVAC - the existing design locates the HVAC system in the attic and on a flat roof (chiller).  The VA is interested in life cycle cost reductions in this system and is requesting the A/E review alternatives for placing the HVAC system on the ground (inside or outside).  There are many incidental items related to the HVAC layout such as the extensive sound attenuation, steel ladder access, structural components, etc.  The building configuration shall be such as to allow for separation of landscaping, wings, or certain room sections which allow for the required 20% in bid alternates.  Phase I of this project will be for the design development:  schematics for general building layout and orientation have already been established in a previous master plan developed along with building 215/216 design.  The A/E shall draw out for review the general building layout and orientation.  Phase II will be the preparation of the contract drawings and specifications, which will involve four submittals required after the design development phase.  First submittal will involve 50% working drawings with marked up specifications and cost estimate;  Second submittal will involve 95% working drawings, edited specifications and cost estimate and Third submittal will involve 100% completed drawings and specifications, revised and detailed cost estimate.  The fourth submittal will be completed drawings and specifications ready for signature furnished in hard copy sets.  Final documents must be provided also electronically in unprotected AutoCAD format, latest version and must be converted to Adobe .pdf format to allow the VA to advertise and distribute bid documents electronically.  Specifications shall be furnished in MS Word document format.  A/E services will also include construction period services, to include attendance at the pre-construction conference, reviewing submittals/shop drawings, resolution of unexpected construction problems, and approximately 50 site visits during actual construction.   Evaluation factors to be considered will be (1) Specialized experience of the firm with similar contracts; (2) Past record of performance on similar contracts; (3) Geographical location and facilities of the working office; (4) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to this project.  Estimated construction cost range is between $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.  The NAICS Code for A/E Services is: 541310/Size Standard $4.5 million.  This is a small business set aside for firms located within the State of Oregon.  A/E Firms experienced in Health Care Facilities interested and desiring consideration shall submit Standard Form 330 by close of business, December 13, 2006 to the Contracting Officer shown above. Award is pending availability of funds.  This is not an RFP.

<SUBJECT>--Industry Day Announcement for the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command Systems (IBCS) Development Program
<DESC>Industry Day Announcement: The Project Manager for the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Project Office is hosting an Industry Day on November 20, 2000 at Redstone Arsenal, AL, for the presentation of general information on the projected future IAMD Project Office requiremen ts for the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Development Program.  The IBCS Development Program industry day briefing is scheduled to begin at 1300 in the Rocket Auditorium, Building 7120, Redstone Road, Redstone Arsena l, AL. Todays Air and Missile Defense (AMD) systems, composed of weapons, sensors and BMC4I end items, operate as self-contained entities with inherent design limitations. These systems have limited interoperability with other AMD systems and the joint community  but are unable to conduct fully integrated operations. The Army intends to connect individual weapon (launchers with interceptors) and sensor components directly onto a network to achieve net centric operations utilizing the IBCS Development Program produ cts. The IAMD Program responds to the US Armys Concept for Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense.  Central to the IAMD program is the IBCS Development Program consisting of the IBCS Major End Items (EI).  The development of these MEIs is essential to achievi ng Army transformation imperatives, connectivity to the Global Interface Grid (GIG) for Joint Operations, obtaining a Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP), establishing Engage on Network Data (END) capabilities and enabling Net-Ready operations for Army AM D components. The IAMD program achieves these objectives by developing the IBCS Command Post (CP) that provides the common IAMD Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) capability, the common Plug and Fight (P& F) Mod Kits that enable sensor and weapon component connectivity with the IFC-Net, and the IFC-Net to enable net centric operations.  This requirement will define the effort required by the contractor for the IBCS Development Program. This program covers program management, systems engineering, integration, manufacturing, test, logistics, and initial production of the IBCS major end item s (MEIs), the IAMD Integrated Fire Control Network (IFC-Net) and supporting products. The IBCS MEIs consist of the IBCS Command Post (CP) and the IBCS Common Plug and Fight Interface Modification Kits (P&F Mod Kits). The IFC-Net consists of the transport layer (radios) and associated net management software resident in the IBCS CP and P&F M od Kits. The contractor will be required to provide support to the IAMD Project Office in the integration of P&F Mod Kits into IAMD weapon and sensor components. A key activity of this effort includes the delivery of IBCS common software module (CSM) confi guration items (CIs). The IBCS Program uses a phased approach to be performed by the contractor for this IBCS Development Program. The initial contract phase includes preliminary design risk reduction activities leading up to and supporting the successful completion of an IAMD Milestone B decision. The second contract phase includes all design activities leading up to and supporting the successful completion of an IAMD Milestone C decision. The final contract phase will include the production and delivery of all IBCS MEI product s and conduct of associated activities leading up to and supporting the successful completion of an IAMD IOC. The IAMD Project Office will provide information to industry regarding the Army's vision for the mission of the IBCS Program Development.  General information will also be made available on the Government's planned acquisition strategy for the IBCS Program  Development.  The Government plans the selection of a contractor through the Best Value competitive source selection process to continue the evolutionary IBCS Development Program. General timelines and schedules will also be addressed Performance o n the projected IBCS Program Development requirements at the prime or subcontractor level will require access to defense information that is not considered appropriate for release to non-US companies.  Therefore, this will be an Unclassified/No Foreign Par ticipation Briefing. The IBCS Development Program contract performance will require that the contractor have a Secret U.S. issued facility security clearance and be able to receive, generate, and store classified material. The contractor will also be requi red to provide personnel with secret U.S. issued security clearances for contract performance.  All interested industry vendors are invited to attend. The Government will not reimburse any cost associated with participation in the Industry Day. Pre-registration is required and is to be submitted by e-mail to the points of contact provided below NLT 1 600 (CST) on 15 Nov 2006. Pre-registration information shall include name, title/position, company, telephone number, e-mail address, and social security number of each person attending. Pre-registration information may be e-mailed to the following individ uals:  Mable.Youngblood@redstone.army.mil,(256)842-7326 or Dorphelia.Foster@redstone.army.mil,(256)876-4189.

Minerals Management Service (MMS) is re-examining the current business model used by the Royalty in Kind (RIK) Office for analyzing, evaluating, and establishing the creditworthiness of RIK counterparties, and to determine MMS-approved unsecured credit lines.  RIK is looking to purchase a product to assist MMS/RIK in discerning and offering credit values for the purpose of Oil and Gas sales of assets under federal leases. Improvements to the RIK credit scoring policy support the overall MRM royalty asset management strategy by minimizing potential credit risk exposure and thereby increasing assurance of proper royalty revenue receipt. The RIK Office implemented a standardized credit scoring model in late 2000. The model has served as an effective and useful launch-point for the RIK program to determined creditworthiness of RIK counterparties. The model essentially weights financial scoring criteria and derives a recommended credit limit based on the quantitative aspects of financial statement analysis.  However, the RIK Office also considers other factors such credit rating agency credit ratings, business reputation, payment histories, and other qualitative factors in establishing approved credit lines for RIK counterparties.  The RIK Office uses this model to assess both potential RIK counterparties during the "pre-qualification" process as well as for monitoring credit exposures for current RIK purchasers. The RIK Office currently evaluates and scores more than 100 counterparties The RIK program has matured substantially over the years and involves many different types of counterparties.  Both the program and the energy industry have evolved to include industrials, utilities, municipals, cooperatives and other end-users, financial institutions, cooperatives, global energy companies (including foreign-based firms), independent refiners, marketing and trading entities, and pipelines, just to name a few.  The financial profiles and business structures of companies in each of these energy sectors vary significantly, and should be accounted for in the credit scoring process.  Also, in light of increased awareness and recognition of the importance of the credit function in energy-related transactions, a trend towards more comprehensive examination of counterparty financial conditions and creditworthiness has been observed in the domestic energy industry.  As such, the RIK Office seeks to improve and enhance its credit management processes to maintain a "leading practices" approach in its business model.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Credit Scoring Model Criteria 1.	An automated credit scoring model for evaluating and scoring companies in all facets of the energy industry 2.
