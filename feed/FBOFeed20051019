<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the procurement of common-of-the-shelf (COTS) communications equipment to allow connection of voice circuit users to the NATO Core Network in various NATO and National locations.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the Infrastructure Committee.  NC3A intends to use basic (one step/one envelope) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure. The successful bid pursuant to this IFB will be that bid which is compliant with the technical requirements and is the lowest price offered.

The estimated value of this project will not be disclosed at this time. NC3A feels that disclosure of the budget information to prospective bidders may be detrimental to the execution of fair competition.  The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) is IFB-11713-CSC. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

The project is to be implemented using COTS equipment that will be required to interoperate with the NATO Core Network voice switches, provided by Siemens. This interoperability, particularly in terms of the Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-Emption Service is considered a high risk project. Therefore prior to Contract Award, the Prospective Contractor will be required to demonstrate and validate its technical proposal for review and acceptance by the Purchaser. This Bid Validation effort shall take place within three weeks after the Prospective Contractor has been notified in writing by NC3A and will not last longer than two weeks. Should the Prospective Contractor not be able to demonstrate to the full satisfaction of NC3A that the proposed Technical Solution meets the Contractual requirements, then the Bid will be deemed non-compliant.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The NATO Core Switches that form the Circuit Switched Component of the NGCS, or the NATO Core Network, were installed during 2000/2002. The network was further augmented in 1Q04. A total of 29 Core Switches are now installed.

The scope of this project is for migration of IVSN (Initial Voice Switched Network - a legacy, analogue system) Direct Subscribers to the NATO Core Network, whether secure or non-secure and both for remote or co-located sites. It also includes provision of services in the countries which have recently become full NATO members and which do not have any IVSN services.

Within this context, the scope of the IFB will be for the supply, installation and configuration of equipment to provide digital voice services to 667 users distributed across around 80 NATO sites and up to 504 NATO users at national facilities distributed across the NATO nations.

Provision of related transmission services and encryption devices are being handled via separate ongoing Contracts and are not part of this IFB.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

The implementation of this project will involve the migration of user services from the analogue IVSN network to digital PABXs and the digital NATO Core Switches that make up the NATO Core Network.

The implementation solutions for the transition of these services will fall into one of two distinct types, depending on the services required by the user. The first type, namely Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-emption (MLPP) service, requires implementation of equipment to provide MLPP services to users to be connected directly to the NCN backbone, using equipment compatible with the MLPP protocols and signaling used by the NCN. The second type does not require this direct connection, and can connect through any digital PABX with suitable connectivity to the NCN.

The project will implement all equipment and services necessary to connect the users authorized under this project to the NCN. There are numerous solutions to this which will include:

(a) Provision and implementation of user terminals directly connected to existing PABXs or NATO Core Switches;

(b) Provision and implementation of user terminals with Remote Access Device (RAD) to connect one or two remote users to existing PABXs or NATO Core Switches. RAD must be transparent and pass ISDN Signaling including MLPP;

(c) Provision and implementation of ISDN Switches compatible with the NCN MLPP signaling where there are concentrations of approved MLPP users remote from the NATO Core Switch;

(d) Provision of equipment, without installation, for use on-board ships to allow connectivity to the NCN over low bandwidth circuits;

(e) Software or hardware upgrades to local PABX where required.

User terminals will be installed, connected and configured by the Contractor. Some will be secure terminals (provided as Purchaser Furnished Equipment (PFE)) with ISDN terminal adaptors (provided as PFE); others will be provided by the Contractor and must be compatible with the NCN MLPP signaling protocols where required.

It is initially estimated that around 37 MLPP-compatible ISDN switches and 313 (pairs of) ISDN Range extenders (for the connection of remote users) will be required, though these figures are subject to change based on the findings of site surveys.

It should be noted that the NCN is implemented using Siemens HiCOM and HiPath digital switches and provides MLPP services through use of proprietary signaling extensions. Transparent compatibility with these services will be required for all equipment supporting MLPP users.

It should additionally be noted that this project does not include provision for a management system. All supplied equipment must be capable of being fully managed from the current NCSA management system, namely Siemens HiPath Manager and HP Openview.

IMPLEMENTATION CONCEPT

The Contractor will be responsible for the planning, provision, installation, configuration and integration all equipment needed to provide the required services to the authorized users.

The Contractor will be required to hold premium-level (e.g. gold, silver) partner status with the vendor of their proposed main equipments, and will be required to utilize personnel with suitable vendor certifications for design, installation and configuration activities.

The migration strategy will be described in the IFB and foresees a significant responsibility for the Contractor.

Prior to implementation, the prospective Contractor will be required to demonstrate compliance by performing a Proof of Concept Test for Technical Evaluation at NC3A-The Hague in addition to the initial validation effort undertaken as part of the Bid Evaluation.

LOGISTICAL SUPPORT

The Contractor will be responsible to provide hardware and software maintenance at all locations during the Warranty Period. The contractor will also be required to provide a comprehensive Integrated Logistics Support package, including spares, technical documentation and training documentation. Follow-on support will be by means of a Contractor Logistic Support arrangement, covering 24/7 telephone & email support and on-site support on demand.

ELIGIBILITY

Interested firms must be nominated by their National Authorities with the required Declaration of Eligibility along with certification of their security clearances. REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED.

The National Delegations are advised that the IFB package will contain material classified up to NATO RESTRICTED, and certification of the Prospective Bidders clearance to handle this material will be required before bid documentation is released. Prospective Bidders should also be aware that contractor personnel will be called on to work at a NATO site in conjunction with the contract and such contractor personnel will be required to have security clearances to the level of NATO SECRET.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Embassy in Brussels to submit a Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) on your behalf: 16 November 2005

2. Anticipated date that the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB/IFB) will be forwarded to those on the Bidder List (distribution of the Cahier des Charges): November 2005

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: December 2005

4. Anticipated contract award date: March 2006

CERTIFICATION

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DOES NOT SERVE AS THE CONTRACTING AGENCY FOR NATO PROJECTS. HOWEVER, ALL FIRMS WHOSE FACILITY IS LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO QUALIFY TO BID FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. 

The contracting entity is the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A). Only firms that the U.S. Department of Commerce has certified as eligible will be allowed to bid. A Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) will be submitted on their behalf to the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, which will in turn provide the Declaration of Eligibility to the contracting entity.

VENDORS MUST QUALIFY UNDER LOT 1 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES UNDER LOT 2, LOT 3, OR LOT 4. LOT 1 is the core of this solicitation. LOT 1 -- Firm Order Services covers firm orders; a one-time order for a specific title (or specific titles) in any format and number of copies, in contrast to a subscription or standing order. Under LOT 2 -- Approval Plans, a vendor automatically supplies materials potentially required by a library as they are published, based on a detailed profile of the library's collection needs. The library may return any publications deemed unsuitable for addition to the collection and is only billed for items retained. In LOT 3 -- Leasing Plan Services, the customer leases publications from the supplier instead of buying them, and retains an option to purchase leases items at a reduced price when the term of the lease is over. In LOT 4 -- Technical and/or Order Processing Services, the vendor may provide technical processing for materials supplied under this solicitation, performing physical processing or cataloging in order to supply materials to the customer in shelf-ready condition. Multiple awards are anticipated. For information on the Library of Congress' FEDLINK program, please visit our website: www.loc.gov/flicc.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. This announcement is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) site located at http://www.fedbizopps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of announcements and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case the FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a modification to National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), 2798 Harbor Drive, San Diego, CA 92113, that establishes firm prices for option Ships 9 through 12 of the Dry Cargo/Ammunition Ship (T-AKE) Class under Contract N00024-02-C-2300.  The T-AKE Class will provide logistic lift from sources of supply and will transfer this cargo at sea to station ships and other naval forces.  Contract N00024-02-C-2300 was competitively awarded!   to NASSCO on 18 October 2001 for the detail design and construction of the T-AKE Class lead ship plus options for the construction of eleven follow ships.  The contract options for Ships 9 through 12 were not definitively priced.  The Navy intends to enter into sole source negotiations with NASSCO to establish firm option prices for the ships.  The detail design for the T-AKE Class is complete and delivery of the lead ship is planned for March 2006.  The Navy has exercised options for follow Ships 2 through 8 and work on those ships is underway.  As the detail design is complete and ship deliveries will commence in calendar year 2006, NASSCO has extensive knowledge and familiarity with the requirements of the ship that would be difficult for another source to overcome if the requirements for Ships 9 through 12 were competed.  NASSCO’s familiarity with the requirements of the ship along with its non-recurring and recurring cost advantages make it impractical to compete the !  requirements.  Therefore, NASSCO is deemed the only responsible source  and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Government’s requirements.  Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact NASSCO directly as follows: POC: Ted Walker, Telephone: (619) 544-8853, Mailing Address: PO Box 85278, San Diego, CA 92186-5278, E-mail: twalker@nassco.com.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   The Office of Research and Development (ORD) intends to award a sole source contract to Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, WA for Microsoft Premier Support. The ORD requirement is for Microsoft Premier Support to provide technical guidance for the ORD standard desktop and server images in use throughout the country. Since Microsoft applications are used throughout ORD (Desktop, Servers, Office Suite and Management Software) only Microsoft Premier Support can provide direct access to Microsoft software developers and proprietary source code for current and future  products on a 7 by 24 basis.  The ORD Call Center and Network Operations Center require such resources to support the ORD user base of 3500 users, 5000 workstations and 200 servers.  Purchasing support from another vendor would not be cost or time effective and would not gain ORD access to the vast  Microsoft knowledge base needed to support ORD on a 7 by 24 basis. This noncompetitive action will be processed in accordance with FAR 6.301-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements). ORD plans to issue this requirement as a firm fixed price  purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, which will be awarded to Microsoft Corporation, Premier Sales, 2118 Water Ridge Parkway, Charlotte, NC 28217. The agreement with Microsoft will provide for specialized technical assistance, hot line availability based on individual  incident calls. This agreement will provide ORD with proactive, personalized support services which are aimed at providing rapid resolution to enterprise support issues during the twelve (12) month period of performance. The Basic Premier Support Service agreement shall include 50 individual  incidents calls, 400 hours of Technical Account Management, and a site visit by the assigned Microsoft Technical Account Manager (TAM). This announcement constitutes the RFP and is the only solicitation that will be issued. Written responses must be submitted via e-mail only to:  mcelroy.genine@epa.gov, by 4:00 PM, EST on Friday, October 28, 2005.  Telephone inquires will not be accepted.  Please include your name, address, area code and telephone/fax number, business class and indicate whether pricing is GSA/FSS or open market.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks to negotiate on a sole source basis to TSI, Inc., for the purchase of an ultra fine condensation particle counter (TSI Model 3025A). The US EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) located in Research Triangle Park has undertaken a project to measure the exchange of small particles between the atmosphere and biosphere.  Due to the small size and potentially high concentrations of particles expected, in addition to the sensitivity and time response  requirements for flux measurements, the detection system must meet strict design specifications.  The analyzer must continuously detect particles down to a minimum size of 3 nm (diameter) with 50% efficiency. The analyzer must continuously detect particles up to a maximum size of  >3 um (diameter).   The analyzer must measure particle concentrations up to 9.99 x 104 particles/cm3.  To measure exchange fluxes using the eddy covariance approach, the analyzer must have a response time of 1s or less.  The analyzer must have a high inlet flow rate (up to 1500 cm3/min) with automatic volumetric flow  control.  The instrument must have a concentration accuracy of +/- 10% and a false background count of <0.01 x 104 particles/cm3.  The instrument will be deployed on elevated platforms above forest and agricultural canopies, and therefore must weight 30 lbs or less.  The analyzer must contain an  internal vacuum pump.  The physical dimensions of the analyzer must not exceed 15"Wx10"Dx10"H. The analyzer must tolerate ambient temperatures in the range 10 to 35 oC and 0 to 90% relative humidity.  The instrument must have RS232, analog voltage, and pulse output capability.  Interested parties  who feel that they possess a product that can meet the requirements above can submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not  to conduct a competitive procurement.   Please send your documentation to Angela Schopler at the office identified above, by fax (513)487-2109 or by e-mail at schopler.angela@epa.gov, which establishes that your specifications or qualifications meet the EPA's requirement.  Documentation must be  received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.  Phone requests will not be honored. A determination by the EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>HSM Federal Business Opportunities
IMPORTANT RESPONSE NOTICE:  ALL inquiries must be directed to Genaro Montya, Sandia National Laboratories, Sandia Contracting Representative: email: emontoy@sandia.gov. Responses must be addressed as provided herein below.

Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia), in Albuquerque, New Mexico intends to contract for construction services to install local hydronic heating systems servicing approximately 50 buildings at Sandia National Laboratories for the Heating Systems Modernization (HSM) project.  

Sandia is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin company, for the United States Department of Energy (DOE).  The purpose of the HSM project is to abandon the steam production and steam/condensate distribution system servicing Technical Area I.  Decommission, decontaminate and demolish the central steam plant and related fuel oil storage and distribution system.  Replace the central system with a local boiler system and domestic hot water system tailored to the individual buildings currently served by the central system.  In general, the goals of the project are to:

•  Replace the existing central steam system with local (building or buildings specific) boiler heating systems.

•  Install domestic hot water equipment to service the needs of the affected buildings.

•  Install new gas utility piping to support the new local systems.

•  Decontaminate the steam pits associated with the steam distribution system and abandon in place.

•  Accomplish all of the above with no or minimal impact on the building occupants.

At this time, Sandia is only requesting Expressions of Interest to establish a list of qualified small business construction contractors.

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to issue an open-season solicitation, RFP# S-LC02015, for the FEDLINK Books and Library Publications Acquisitions Program.  This Request for Proposals (RFP) is for services from vendors who can supply books and library publications (non-serial publications) and associated acquisition support services to federal libraries, information centers, and other federal offices.  The services of serials subscription agents is covered under a separate LC/FEDLINK solicitation and is not the subject of this solicitation.  The RFP is divided into four lots which define four different but related aspects of books and library publications acquisitions: LOT 1 - Firm Order Services; LOT 2 - Approval Plan Services; LOT 3 - Leasing Plan Service; and LOT 4 - Technical and/or Order Processing Services.   VENDORS MUST QUALIFY UNDER LOT 1 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES UNDER LOT 2, LOT 3, OR LOT 4.  LOT 1 is the core of this solicitation.   LOT 1 -- Firm Order Services covers firm orders; a one-time order for a specific title (or specific titles) in any format and number of copies, in contrast to a subscription or standing order.  Under LOT 2, -- Approval Plans, a vendor automatically supplies materials potentially required by a library as they are published, based on a detailed profile of the library's collection needs.  The library may return any publications deemed unsuitable for addition to the collection and is only billed for items retained.  In LOT 3, -- Leasing Plan Services, the customer leases publications from the supplier instead of buying them, and retains an option to purchase leased items at a reduced price when the term of the lease is over.  In LOT 4 -- Technical and/or Order Processing Services, the vendor may provide technical processing for materials supplied under this solicitation, performing physical processing or cataloging in order to supply materials to the customer in shelf-ready condition.   Multiple awards are anticipated. For information on the Library of Congress' FEDLINK program, please visit our website:  www.loc.gov/flicc.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

GSA Design Excellent Solicitation for Lead Design Architect
C-Architect-Engineer Services Solicitation #:  GS-01P-06-BZ-C-0004

Region: 01 New England 
City/State:  Boston, MA
Contracting Officer:  Kathryn Thomas
Phone Number: 617-565-8826

PROJECT:  Modernization of the Margaret Chase Smith Federal Building, Post Office and Courthouse, Bangor, Maine.
BUILDING TYPE:  Federal Building, Post Office, Courthouse
HISTORIC STRUCTURE:  No
CLIENT AGENCY:  Eighteen (18) different federal agencies, which include U.S. Courts, U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Postal Service, Social Security Administration, Senate and House of Representatives
SIZE:  165,807 square feet of gross floor area
PARKING SPACES:  109 inside and 27 outside parking spaces
BUDGET:  $14,490,000 Estimated Construction Cost
GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:  35% of A/E level of effort must be performed within the State of Maine.

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, interior designers, and engineers to modernize our federal buildings and prepare them for the next 50 to 100 years of services.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural-engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals and security requirements.  The requirement to design the facility in metric units is optional.  All projects will be LEED certified.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  
This project is for improvements to a 3-story (plus basement) 1967 modernist reinforced concrete structure with a brick and masonry façade.  It is located in downtown Bangor, Maine, and will include:
 1) Renovation of tenant areas, restrooms, correction of code deficiencies, abatement of hazardous materials (i.e. asbestos and lead paint), upgrading of elevators; upgrading of accessibility to meet the requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); 
2) Alterations to main lobby/entrance;  
3) Upgrading of plumbing, fire protection, mechanical and electrical systems, and security; 
4) Window replacement;  
5) Site improvements.
This project shall encompass, to the fullest extent practically and economically possible, all sound principles of sustainable design.  The facility shall remain substantially occupied throughout the project.  Work shall be conducted in phases to accommodate occupancy of the building.  The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope projects with an emphasis on complex multi-phased renovation/alteration and asbestos abatements.  In addition, GSA is in the process of evaluating federal buildings of the 1950s through the 1970s.  The A/E shall identify, assess, and preserve character-defining features and attributes of the original design.  Design changes to be well-integrated and compatible with the original design, so that the building retains its architectural character.

ESTIMATED CONSTRUCTION COST FOR THIS PROJECT:  Between $10,000,000 and $20,000,000.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum:  professional architectural, engineering, interior design, landscape architecture, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer aided design and drafting (CADD), and post-construction contract services (PCCS).  The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities, conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements.  

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.  

A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed within the State of Maine.   The A/E firm must address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and project team in Stage II.  

The A/E selection will be completed in TWO stages as follows: In STAGE I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the Lead Designer and design firm.  In Stage II, shortlisted Lead Designer-A/E Teams will be interviewed.  

Stage I
All documentation will be in an 8.5” x 11” format.  The assembled Stage I portfolio should be no more than ¼ inch thick.  Submissions may be double-sided where feasible.  The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the FedBizOpps announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Part II; and responses to the submission requirements and evaluation criteria listed below.  An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of private sector peer and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The board will establish a shortlist of three to six firms.  

Identification of team members, other than the Lead Designer(s), is not required at this stage.  Consultant and “production firm” (if different from the design firm) information should not be included in the Stage I portfolio.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 339999   Amendment #3 Technical Questions Question #1: If the tanks are to be partially buried, why are you asking for saddle supports for the tanks? Answer:  The Fed Biz Ops announcement does not mention or require saddle supports. Question #2: Fiberglass tanks cannot be  partially buried, they must be fully buried, so if we use steel tanks, must they have an internal coating or lining? Answer:  The portion of the tank that contacts the stored water must not leach chemicals into the stored water.  For example, the EPA is currently using a PE flexible liner within a  galvanized steel structural member, similar to an above-ground back-yard swimming pool.  In other applications the EPA is currently using self-supporting tanks made entirely of PE. Question #3:  Because of Hurricane Katrina and the steel availability problems, it is doubtful that these tanks, in  any quantity could be delivered in 4 weeks. Answer: If you are unable to meet the delivery schedule, please note the delivery schedule that you can meet.  Delivery time will be a consideration for award, as stated in the Fed Biz Ops Specifications.  (1) Technical acceptability of the item offered  to meet the Government's requirement and (2) Technical acceptability shall be evaluated on a pass or fail basis (with the lowest price technically acceptable receiving award).   Delivery time is part of the specifications for this requirement.   Question #4:  Can the EPA confirm the number and  size of the openings you need, as well as the manhole on the top of the tank centerline that you need? Answer:  There are no man-holes described in the RFQ.  The EPA will install the openings in the small stormwater tanks.  The supplier must provide directions for installing the pipe connections  and cutting the overflow weir (as stated in the Fed Biz Ops Specifications.  The internal tank of the nested tank pair requires a bottom opening that will accept a 1 1/2-inch (minimum) PVC pipe, as also stated in the Fed Biz Ops Specifications. The last date for technical questions for this  requirement is October 21, 2005.  Amendment #2 Technical Questions Question #1:  Can we assume all of the tanks can be double walled and fiberglass? Answer: Double walled and fiberglass is acceptable, but not required. Question #2:  Can we assume the nested tanks are two tanks fixed together  that work independently of each other and the EPA wants four sets totaling eight tanks, and the minimum pipe diameter is one (1) inch in each tank?  Answer:  The tanks are set of two (eight total tanks).   The minimum pipe diameter is 1 ? inches, 1 inch is not acceptable? Question #3:  Will the  tank flushing or cleaning be conducted without a clean-out opening or access port? Answer:  The tanks must have an open top (not sealed). Amendement #1 Technical Questions  Question #1:  The Fed Biz Ops announcement states that the tanks will be "partially buried".  What exactly does that mean?   Are the tanks going to be buried 1/4 or 1/2 way up, or what specifically? Answer:  The Burial depth will vary from tank to tank.  Typically from 25% to 75% of total tank height will be below grade.

<DESC>The Prescott National Forest plans to secure Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple year contracts for professional surveying services as required for administration of National Forest System Lands in Northern Arizona.  The work will primarily involve surveying and marking property boundaries of land within the Prescott National Forest Proclamation Boundary, but may also include projects on the adjacent Kaibab and Coconino National Forests. 
The Forest Service anticipates award of approximately two IDIQ contracts with task orders issued estimated at approximately $5,000.00 to $30,000.00 with an estimated contract maximum of $150,000.00 per contract over the life of the contract.  An Arizona Registered Professional Land Surveyor must be assigned to each task order.  Only firms with Registered Professional Surveyor(s) licensed in the state in of Arizona will be considered.
Tasks include, but are not limited to, identification, monumentation and perpetuation of property corners and controlling corners for land surveys performed to locate property boundaries, boundary line posting and maintenance of previously posted lines. Work may include retracement of Rectangular Surveys of the Public Land Survey System, including section subdivision, as well as retracement of Homestead Entry Surveys and Mineral Surveys that will require the results of survey to be recorded in the public record. The projects may also include right-of-way surveys, topographic surveys, geodetic control, mapping and other incidental work normally associated with the survey profession. A map of the general work area (Northern Arizona) is available for ftp download by contacting rjjackson@fs.fed.us. 
Estimated award date is on or about November 23, 2005.  Individual task orders will be issued against each contract as needed to accomplish the work. Completion time will vary with each individual task order, and may be negotiated. The contracts will not preclude the Forest Service from using its own surveyors, or other surveying firms to perform surveys in the project area. 
Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection, subject to any limitations indicated with respect to size and geographic location of firm, specialized technical expertise and other requirements listed.  Following an initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, an estimated two or more firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required, will be chosen for negotiation.  Selection of firms for negotiation will be made through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualification necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required.

This is a sole source solicitation for the supplies listed in Section B for both DLA stock locations and military customers around the world.  CONTRACT SCOPE:  The scope of this long-term initiative is items for which Rix Industries is an approved source and/or items which Rix Industries has supplied in the past directly or through dealers, whether or not the NSNs are ultimately procured from Rix Industries, Cage Code 28953.  438 NSNs are included in this initial grouping (see listing of NSNs below).

Specifications, plans or drawings are NOT AVAILABLE.  This is an UNRESTRICTED acquisition.  Other Than Full and Open Competitive procedures apply.

<DESC>W15P7T-06-R-S213, Amendment #1 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOTES TO ALL POTENTIAL RESPONDERS: This is an Amendment to the current RFI W15P7T-06-R-S213 published on the FEDBIZOPS website. The areas in which changes have been made are NOT separately identified in this Amendment.  1.	PURPOSE: The purpose of Amendment #1 is to provide additional information to all potential industry responders and additional conditions which must be satisfied prior to release of OEM/System information identified in the Military Critical Technologies List (MCTL).  2.	BACKGROUND: The system is currently in production and is under contract to the Government for that effort.  Industries response to RFI W15P7T-05-R-S251 was consistent in that the need for additional detail was needed, example being: '&the Technical Data  Package (TDP), the Bill of Materials (BOM), engineering data, etc.&' 3.	SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The 'System' is a wideband ECM device comprised of a Receiver/Transmitter (R/T) subsystem consisting of a chassis with five circuit card assemblies (CCA), power amplifiers, power conditioning. The system design is current, state-of-t he-art design with surface mount, multi-layer CCAs, with embedded firmware/FPGA controlling system operation in two modes: as an active transmitter and in a reactive mode. There is an associated Remote Control Unit (RCU) for remote operation via direct cab le interface to the R/T unit. An antenna and associated RF cables are part of the system configuration, as are a 'ruggedized PDA and Laptop, and associated software/firmware coding which may be provided in support of the production effort. 4.	SYSTEM BASELINE: A REDACTED Technical Data Package  TDP is being made available to industry production, integration, and test of the system. The Government believes that the information provided in the TDP (and associated documents) is sufficient for i ndustry to prepare a response to the RFI. The TDP is being validated through a Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) or Physical Configuration Audit (PCA).  Design Verification Test (DVT) and FAT have been completed.  The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OE M) and the Government have verified all aspects of the system performance and design with First Article Test (FAT) and Operational Assessment (OA) and the system will go into high/full rate production.  5.	RFI supporting information: The CREW/Spiral-2 system falls into multiple MCTL Sections, consequently there are additional requirements being imposed on industry prior to industry gaining access to the TDP. These requirements are identified in paragraph 13 below. a.	The Government WILL PROVIDE: A redacted version of the TDP, limited to the essential elements necessary for industry to respond ·	29 October 2005: 	- Selected drawings, BOM, Spec and Source Control Drawings for critical items ·	18 October 2005: - Test Plans and Procedures: FAT, Reliability, EMI, Production Acceptance Test, Environmental Stress Screening/Production Acceptance Test (ESS/PAT-HASS) - Statement of Work, with Contract Data Items (CDRLs)  - A REDACTED version of the Classified Performance Specification b.	Access to the system at the time of Government-Industry one-on-one discussions c.	For planning purposes: ·	The following system quantities are applicable (subject to Government change) under an IDIQ:  -  Variable production and delivery rates/dates based on a 12 month delivery schedule from acceptance of FAT completion and validation of the offerors production approach. 500/month		  6000 systems 750/month		  9000 systems 1000/month		12000 systems 1250/month		15000 systems 1500/month		18000 systems ·	A two phased  procurement approach is envisioned: - LRIP (CPFF or other): Schedule/time to enter into and complete FAT, validate the offerors capability and performance in building the system, NRE cost identified - Production: FFP (or other) d.	The Government will NOT provide as part of this RFI Signals of Interest (SO I)/threat information classified program related information or documents. e.	Document Library. Documents are loaded into the Document Library. The program specific information i.e. 'the TDP...' will be place on a secure Army Single Face to Industry (ASIF)/Interactive Business Opportunity (IBOP) location with the file name: 'W15P 7T-06-R-S213  Redacted TDP' Only vendors with an approved DD Form 2345 shall be granted access to this library (see paragraph 13 below). Access to the Document Library can be obtained by clicking on the link below. https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/s213library.nsf 6.	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: Provide a secondary production, integration, test and delivery capability based on the following: a.	Production/manufacturing directly or via subcontracting for, the critical essential system elements: CCAs, power amplifiers, chassis etc based on the drawing package in a collaborative leader follower relationship. b.	Integration and test of the R/T & RCU based on developed Acceptance Test Procedures c.	Environmental Stress Screening (ESS)/Production Acceptance Test (PAT) based on developed test plans and procedures. This will require single or multiple test chambers capable of meeting composite temperature/vibration profiles (example: QualMark Typho on 4.0 System). d.	An existing production infrastructure for complex electronics systems manufacturing, production, integration and test to include Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment in the RF ranges to 10 GHz. e.	Demonstrated performance in the manufacturing, production, integration and test of complex electronics and systems, examples: countermeasure systems (ECM), electronic support measures (ESM), or signals intelligence (SIGINT) systems, or their equivalent f.	An ability to achieve a nominal sustained systems delivery production rate of 500 systems per month, to 1500 systems per month peak based on the quantities identified above. Increased delivery rates (surge/acceleration in time or quantity) may occur  and must be considered. g.	A preliminary/transition Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPIF) phase in which the production line, methods, processes and procedures are developed based on information and drawings provided by the OEM and the line is validated and a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) phas e for systems production and delivery to the Government. 7.  	RESPONSE AND INFORMATION REQUIRED  Your responses must be structured and consistent with the paragraph numbering in this RFI, specifically paragraph 6 and 7, using the information provided in the previous paragraphs. We request that your responses be  as specific as possible to each topical area. The offerors response should include and identify assumptions as it relates to the Governments requirements vs. your RFI response. a.	NAICS Classification b.	CAGE Code c.	Date and currency of offerors facility clearance for processing, generation and storage of classified material to the SECRET/No Foreign Dissemination level d.

<DESC>Amendment 0002 to solicitation W911W6-05-R-0007 is issued to provide clarification to all prospective offerors.  The proposal closing date of 2:00 pm EDT 31 October 2005 will remain unchanged as a result of this amendment. 1.  The BAA references a link to a CBM+ presentation which states that the approach should be to 'begin with the health of dynamic components and eventually transition to non-rotating components over time'. This is presumably because of the high pay-off to structural integrity associated with reducing failures in dynamic (rotating) components that operate at high stress.  Is this also the preferred approach in the subject BAA -- that is, are rotating components favored over airframes? Please refer to the solicitation: 'The system (SIMS) is intended to enhance the Army's Rotorcraft Structural Integrity Program (RSIP) as well as complement the Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) initiative....'  This BAA is not meant be either of thos e efforts, but rather to complement them by maturing technology that will benefit both CBM & RSIP. The SIMS BAA concentrates on monitoring and determining the integrity of structural airframe components. The roadmaps found in the additional information slides are not meant to outline an approach for this BAA effort, but rather to provide background information to the Offerors.  The objectives of the SIMS BAA effort are found in the solicitation: '(1) Devel op a methodology to gather the required information needed to assess the structural integrity of the monitored component(s) through sensors or sensor networks.  This objective includes developing an effective mechanism to embed or fasten the sensor(s) to t he structure without weakening or interfering with the structure.  (2) Develop the required algorithms to translate the transmitted sensor data and determine the structural integrity of the component and aircraft.  (3) Develop an integrated system that pro vides real-time structural integrity status to the aircrew and maintainer.' 2. The above CBM+ presentation also provides a roadmap with an initial Phase I that includes advanced sensors, low/self power electronics, wireless/networked architecture, damage detection systems, and reliability assessment models. This is followed by a Phase II on prognostic algorithms, proactive model of remaining useful life, probabilistic frameworks, and protocol for inspection requirements. Is this the developmental approach favored in the subject BAA? If so, is Phase II beyond the scope of the present procurement? See answer to question 1. 3. Is OEM participation preferred in this initial phase of the SIMS development? The Government has no preference wit respect to utilizing the OEM preference.  However, any teaming arrangement must be consistent with FAR Part 9. 4.  Is there a specific vehicle or structure that this topic is geared toward?  Is there a generic design or drawing that can be provided for the current part to be replaced? See answer to question 8 5. Can the specific loads and structure requirements be provided so that proposal can address the redesign issues?  See answer to question 8 6. What are the part weight goals, if not for specific part then perhaps on a square foot basis.  See answer to question 8 7. What is the specific threat level you are looking to defeat?  I see some details but are there more? See answer to question 8 8. What is the volume that the new design may occupy, i.e. How thick may it get and still fit in the aircraft.  In response to questions 4 through 8, note that the synopsis indicates applicability of any developed technologies to a range of platforms.  Therefore no specificity beyond that described in the synopsis is appropriate.   9. May the company team with a government agency for design and testing support. This is addressed in the synopsis as follows: 'If Government test facilities are proposed for use in this effor t, the scope and type of testing proposed should be clearly identified to support the cost reasonableness determination of the overall proposal.'   10. Can I get more information on the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6, what does this specifically entail? This is public information easily found through common approaches such as internet searches, e.g. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Technology+Readiness+Level%22    11.  For Topics 02-2006 and Topic 03-2006: '...The government anticipates developmental and validation testing to support the spaced armor concepts.  If Government test facilities are proposed for use in this effort, the scope and type of testing proposed should be clearly identified to support the cost reasonableness determination of the overall proposal....'  Will validation testing identified at the government facility be at government expense or should the contractor include as a part of proposed cost? If it is at government expense, is that expense included in the government cost share/funding limitation identified in the solicitation?  The offeror should propose an approach to satisfy the technical requirements of the solicitation.  All proposed costs and cost sharing should be clearly identified in the cost proposal.  All assumptions should also be clearly stated.  12. Is the approximately $900K funding level the total amount expected to be available for all multiple awards for topic 01-2006 or are multiple awards of $900K each possible? The Government's current funding limit for Topic 01-2006 is approximately $900K. The combined total of all awards under the topic cannot exceed the funding limit.

<CONTACT>Michelle Sandoval, Purchasing Agent, Phone (303) 497-3983, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email michelle.sandoval@noaa.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  The National Weather Service (NWS) is investigating the implementation of a Battery Monitoring System (BMS) to monitor the Transition Power Source (TPS) supporting the NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radar WSR-88D.  The TPS used in the NEXRAD is a Powerware Model 9315-50.  This TPS is a continuous duty, reverse transfer system that consists of a string of 40, 12V VRLA batteries connected in series, a solid-state rectifier, inverter, static switch, and micro-processor controlled logic.  During normal TPS operation, power is provided to the TPS by the utility source.  The AC utility power is converted to DC using a full-wave, six-pulse, solid-state rectifier that supplies nominal DC voltage to the inverter while simultaneously maintaining the charge on the battery string.  The inverter produces a three-phase regulated output utilizing Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM).  The output of the inverter is connected to the primary windings of a transformer.  The secondary windings are connected to the radar sites critical load, thus providing total electrical isolation during normal system operation.  If utility power is lost, the TPS reverts to Battery Mode, providing ride-through power to the critical load until either the emergency diesel generator comes on line or utility power is restored.  If neither occurs, the TPS is capable of providing 9 minutes of continuous, clean power at full rated load (40KW @ .8pf) through the use of the installed battery bank.  1.0 GENERAL:  The NWS is considering implementing a BMS in approximately 150 radars located within the U. S. and in several foreign countries.  The TPS to be monitored is installed entirely within a pre-cast concrete, environmentally controlled, equipment shelter located near the transmitter of each WSR-88D radar.  The 40 VRLA batteries are housed in a steel cabinet, arranged in 5 shelves of 8 batteries, each.  Power available within the shelter is 110V, 60 Hz, or 208V, 60 Hz, 3-phase power.  1.1 The Powerware 9315-50 TPS has a built-in battery test function.  However, this function is recommended for use only if the system load exceeds 50% of capacity.  The WSR-88D does not routinely draw sufficient load to support implementation of this test function.  As a result, the NWS maintenance technicians identify “bad” batteries through routine manual testing of the batteries or individual battery testing in response to TPS failure to support the load during a transition event.  1.2 Dependant upon the responses to this RFI and the availability of funding, the NWS intends to procure between 2 and 4 different BMS to test with the Powerware 9315-50 TPS in operational radars.  2.0 DESIRED BMS CHARACTERISTICS:  2.1 Compatibility- A proposed BMS must be fully compatible with the Powerware TPS. The BMS must not induce any faults in the TPS and the functions of the BMS must be transparent to the operation of the TPS in all modes of operation.  2.2 Effectiveness- A proposed BMS must accurately indicate specific failing batteries prior to their impacting the TPS ability to support the critical load in the battery mode of operation.  2.3 Portability of Data- The data provided by the proposed BMS must be available locally, as well as remotely via Ethernet, RS-232, etc.
2.4 Ease of Use- The proposed BMS must provide a simple, straight forward, user interface that requires no special training to comprehend.  A user with basic computer skills and a high school education must be able to learn the operation of the BMS using only OEM provided instructional materials.   2.5 Ease of Maintenance- The proposed BMS must provide self-diagnostics and modular design should support the identification and replacement of failed components with no specialized tools, training, or test equipment required.  2.6 Reliability- The proposed BMS must have demonstrated a high degree of reliability when used with systems similar to the Powerware TPS in question.  3.  RESPONSES.   Responses to this RFI must include the BMS manufacturer and model number, a product description, which addresses the characteristics listed in paragraph 2.0 above.  Responses must also include a statement regarding current availability, (in production or fully developed but not in production), and estimated cost of the product.  This RFI does not constitute an invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes.  Should the results of this market research indicate feasibility of supporting our battery monitoring requirements with existing commercial products, the NWS will choose between 2 and 4 systems to test when funds become available.  Dependant upon the results of this testing the NWS will consider retrofit options for its nationwide network of WSR-88D radars as a future product improvement project.  This is not a request for proposal and there is no solicitation available.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Information should be sent to the attention of Michelle Sandoval, U.S. Dept. of Commerce/NOAA, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, Boulder, CO, 80305 or by email at michelle.sandoval@noaa.gov. no later than November 4, 2005.

<DESC>The Aircraft Accessories Commodity Council (AACC), located at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, is seeking interested sources with the capability to integrate current competitive spares manufacture and repair/overhaul requirements.  The AACC is planning for long-term, multiple-award IDIQ contracts with several prime integrators.  We anticipate that participation as a prime integrator under NAICS code 541330 will be limited to/set-aside for small business participants with further potential for partial set-aside awards to any of the following groups, as deemed appropriate, prior to solicitation issuance: 8(a) Hubzone, Hubzone, 8(a), Service Disabled Vet and Small Business. 

AACC will host an Industry Day on Wednesday, 16 Nov 2005.  The Industry Day will be held at the Tinker Conference Center, Building 6001 from 0800 to 1200 hrs.  The major topics for discussion are the AACC competitive strategy and requests for subsequent oral capability presentations.  The current competitive workload includes integration of spares, repair, and overhaul/modification actions that fall within the following Federal Stock Classes: 1650, 1660, 1680, 3010, 3020, 3030, 3040, 4320, 4710, 4720, 4730, 4810, and 4820.  The Air Force estimates that the total value of this competitive spiral will exceed $1.9B.  Prime integrators are expected to price more than 4000 NSNs during the solicitation process utilizing current Air Force approved sources.  Awardees will ultimately be selected through a “source selection” process requiring technical, management, and cost proposals.  Participants wishing to attend are required to send an e-mail to 448msug.gbmoa@tinker.af.mil with the following information: Name, Rank, Title, E-mail address, Company Name and Address, Phone Number and Fax Number.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (OASPA), is seeking capabilities statements from organizations with the core competency to provide closed captioning services for taped programs, live programs, and emergency broadcasting. The NAICS Code is 512110 and the size standard is $25.0 M. In today’s world, any terrorist event, as well as a major natural disaster, is an instant national, if not international, story.  In the immediate moments after an event occurs, a host of activities begin to unfold in response to the consequences of the event.  Not the least of these is the onslaught of media coverage and their accompanying ravenous demand for information 24 hours a day.  Today, how we as a Government communicate with the media and the public about how we are responding to a crisis is just as important as how we deploy our physical assets such as law enforcement, health care and recovery personnel. The Department of Health and Human Services must be able to immediately share broadcast quality video and audio to the news media, and the general public through a variety of methods, all of which require live closed-captioning of audio.  The Department has currently used over 1000 hours of live captioning service.  The television broadcast signals originate from five studios within the HHS television system.  Each facility would have caption encoder systems on-site to receive caption data via modem.  Each broadcast facility will provide a dial-up numbers for program audio to remote caption reporter, as well as a coordination line for questions or problems that will be answered in the control room.  Possible deliverables include: 1) Live Caption Data Stream:  The contractor shall deliver via modem, a live data stream of real-time roll-up / pop-on caption data to the caption encoders at the broadcast site.  This data stream should closely follow live program audio in time and with a 98% or better accuracy rate.  2) Caption Data File:  The contractor shall provide, a computer CD-ROM, a text or Microsoft WORD program file of the captioned event.  This data will be used as a transcript of the program, or for web-streaming applications, as well as being placed on file for future use.  3) Foreign language Subtitles:  On limited occasions, the Department may need to provide foreign language subtitles of programs that are either Live or pre-recorded on videotape.  This service should be delivered in the same method as standard captioning service. The capability statement should address all the following capabilities: 1) The contractor shall have staff that is proficient in the medical and scientific terminology used by agencies within HHS. 2) The Contractor shall have the capability to handle up to five live captioning programs simultaneously.  3) The contractor shall be able to provide captioning services lasting 8 hours or more, and in the event of emergency broadcast operations, sustained 24x7 operations.  4) The contractor must also have the appropriate technical equipment and connectivity to all HHS broadcast facilities, to provide captioning service.  5) The contractor must have encoders, phone lines, modem and capabilities in order to send/receive signals from HHS studios. No solicitation exists, and any solicitation that possibly could result from this announcement will be synopsized and advertised. Interested contractors possessing ALL of the required capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a cover letter along with a capability statement not to exceed 5 pages demonstrating the ability to perform ALL aspects of the effort described therein. Responses must include the following: name and address of the firm, named central point of contact along with email address; DUNS number; any applicable commercial price list(s); size of business, including average annual revenues for the past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are a large, small, small-disadvantaged, 8(a) HUBZone, woman-owned, historically black college or university and/or minority service institute, number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners; list of customers covering the past five years; and additional documentation such as company literature and brochures. If this additional documentation supports the required capabilities it is incumbent to address this reference in the cover letter or other area of the capability statement and indicate specifically how it addresses the capabilities sought. A mere referenced website is unacceptable for purposes of this announcement and will not be considered or reviewed. Capability statements must be submitted via email to pscacquisitions@psc.gov, to the attention of Jonathan Hamlet and referencing this announcement number.

<SUBJECT>21” diameter Mission Reconfigurable Unmanned Undersea Vehicle System (MRUUVS)
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to award a contract in fiscal year 2006 to design and build a 21” diameter Mission Reconfigurable Unmanned Undersea Vehicle System (MRUUVS).  The MRUUVS, is planned to achieve initial operational capability in 2011, and is intended as a submarine (SSN688 and Virginia Class) operated system capable of meeting the Navy’s requirements for clandestine intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and limited ocean survey. On January 26, 2005 NAVSEA released a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) soliciting new and innovative concepts in the development and demonstration of technologies applicable to UUVs.  There was a one-day meeting with industry held at the Kossiakoff Center at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory on September 1, 2005 to provide industry information on the MRUUVS requirements, concept of operation, government support risk reduction efforts, and acquisition strategy.  NAVSEA will also solicit industry feedback on these areas to assist in final preparation of the MRUUVS request for procurement.  Then the Navy released a web based Technical Information Center (TIC) designed to provide both acquisition and technical information relating to the MRUUVS procurement on August 25, 2005.  The TIC is available at the website http://www.nuwc.navy.mil/npt/mruuvs.   The full BAA is available at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DON/NAVSEA/NAVSEAHQ/N0002405R6309/listing.html.

<SUBJECT>A -- DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED MICROFABRICATED ATOMIC CLOCKS
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Time and Frequency Division proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Notre Dame for the development of advanced microfabricated atomic clocks.  The NIST Optical Frequency Measurements group has a program on chip-scale atomic clocks (CSAC) to design, build and characterize miniature vapor-cell atomic frequency references based on fabrication techniques traditionally used in the field of microelectronics and micro-electric-mechanical systems (MEMS). The NIST Optical Frequency Measurements group is currently building structures that are the size of a grain of rice (V < 10 mm3) and could run on an AA battery (dissipate < 75 mW). These atomic clocks are stable enough that they neither gain nor lose more than ten millionths of a second over the course of one day and are paving the way for atomic-level timekeeping in portable, battery-operated systems such as global positioning receivers and wireless communications.
The specific tasks to be carried out by the Notre Dame researchers will be as follows:
1.	Construction of a chip-scale atomic clock physics package based on existing NIST technology with a size below 20 mm3, a power dissipation below 100 mW and a fractional frequency instability below 10-11 at one hour of integration. This task is expected to be carried out in close collaboration with researchers at the NIST-Boulder facility.
2.	Evaluation of the performance of chip-scale atomic clock devices developed by NIST with regard to long-term frequency instability, power dissipation and reliability.
3.	Implementation of chip-scale atomic clock physics package designs modified based on the evaluation of initial structures to achieve lower power dissipation and improved long-term frequency stability.
Because of the advanced and collaborative nature of the work, the contractor must be familiar with the following:
1.	Design, fabrication and testing of alkali vapor cells based on lithographically-defined structures etched in Silicon wafers.
2.	Assembly of vertically-integrated atomic clock structures based on microfabricated vapor cells including knowledge of relevant bonding techniques, alignment processes and thermo-mechanical properties of the structural components.
3.	Control parameters affecting the long-term stability of chip-scale atomic frequency references.
4.	Operational details of microfabricated atomic clock physics packages including the connection between changes in the cell fabrication process and changes in the long-term frequency instability of the atomic clocks.
5.	The use of coherent population trapping in the implementation of compact atomic frequency references and the knowledge of optical pumping techniques in atomic physics.
The research group at the University of Notre Dame is uniquely qualified in this area as demonstrated by the collaborative research throughout the last two years.  The contract period is December 1, 2005 through November 30, 2006.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Rima (e-mail preferred).  Anticipated award date is November 1, 2005.

Local national contractor employees requiring access to United States Air Force-occupied United Kingdom bases must comply with Third Air Force Instruction 31-501, and all local Security Forces requirements.  This is an overview and does not contain all the specifics contained in the Instruction.2.  New contractor employees may be escorted onto the installation, only, to fill out paperwork.  The employee is not to start work until all required paperwork has been submitted to the appropriate office.3.  Prior to beginning employment on the installation, individuals must, at a minimum, have a completed Local Files Check (LFC).  Individuals with LFCs, are required to be escorted by an authorized US citizen (reference Instruction 31-501 for US citizen clearance requirements) or a local national with a Security Check (SC) who has escort authority.4.  Unescorted access requires a Host Agency Check (HAC).  There are two levels of background investigations that meet the standards that meet this requirement.  The level of background check required, will depend on whether the position is considered sensitive or non-sensitive.  Only people with SC will be able to escort people onto the installation.a.  The Counter Terrorist Check (CTC).  The CTC is a national-level security and police background investigation conducted by the Defence Vetting Agency (DVA).   This is the minimum check required for all contractor/subcontractor employees in non-sensitive positions requiring unescorted installation access.  The CTC expires three years from the issue date. b.  The Security Check (SC).  The SC includes all of the elements of the CTC but is a more comprehensive investigation and includes such actions as a credit check, interviewing relatives, determining and evaluating the individual’s involvement in various organizations, verifying any past military experience, etc.  This is the minimum check required for employees and contractor personnel in sensitive positions.  Most SCs expire five years from the issue date.5.  Individuals employed in sensitive positions may only be assigned to and or perform the non-sensitive portion of the position until the SC is positively completed or they must be provided with direct supervision by a U.S. citizen or an individual with a completed SC. 6.  Investigation renewal.  All employees renewing their background investigation will complete an MOD Form 1109, Security Questionnaire.  On the front cover of the form, under General Details, the employee will mark the appropriate block indicating a security questionnaire has been completed before and will complete the form with current information.  Renewal paperwork should be submitted 6 months prior to the current background expiration date to avoid a possible lapse in installation access. 7.  Functional Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) will be the point-of-contact for processing security clearances.  They will provide necessary documents to contractor employees, compile completed forms, submit documents to Security Forces, and sign USAFE Form 79.  The following must be accomplished ‘in-turn’ for all new contractor employees. Contractor will provide the following to QAP: Completed LCF (conducted by HAC Office), Completed MOD Form 1109, Security Questionnaire (required for CTC or SC; completed by unit submitter), Completed USAFE Form 19, Residency Check for Employment with United States Air Forces in Europe, Completed AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action, Completed USAFE Form 79, Application for Base Entry Identification (completed by unit submitter/to be completed once the individual has been cleared), Completed Basic Check Verification Record (BCVR)(verified and signed by unit submitter) 8.  Upon receipt of a favourable HAC and all required documentation, the contractor employee will be issued a USAFE Form 79 which must be in the employee's possession at all times while on the installation.  The expiration date of the Form 79 will be the contract expiration date or one year, whichever is shorter.  The contractor is responsible for collecting and turning in to the QAP, all Form 77s for employee who are no longer in their employment, applies.

TITLE - Statement of work for data entry and analysis

INTRODUCTION - This procurement is for data entry and analysis of datasets supplied by the EPA. The contractor shall enter data into Excel spreadsheets.  The period of performance will be November 3, 2005 to April 30, 2006. 

BACKGROUND - Acute-to-Chronic Estimation (ACE) and Interspecies Correlation Estimation (ICE) are two programs developed at the Gulf Ecology Division to extrapolate acute toxicity data to chronic toxicity data (ACE) and to extrapolate toxicity data across species (ICE). These programs are based on regression and accelerated life testing models which need to be validated using external data sources (e.g. data from scientific literature, data obtained from other NHEERL ecology divisions). Once entered, validation data sets will be used to determine under which circumstances the ACE and ICE models make valid predictions.

SCOPE - The datasets shall be toxicity data in hard copy and electronic files, including (1) acute toxicity values (e.g., LC50 results) for generating species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) using ICE (interspecies correlation estimation program), and (2) raw mortality data from acute toxicity tests and results of chronic toxicity tests for validation of ACE (acute to chronic estimation program).  EPA will supply the contractor with 120 datasets for data entry. The contractor shall be responsible for providing the computer and Excel software needed to perform this work.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/TASK DESCRIPTIONS – ICE and ACE software shall be used for data analysis. EPA will provide the contractor with a copy of the ACE and ICE software, which are available to the public at no charge. ICE shall be used to estimate LC50 values for each chemical in the datasets used to generate SSDs (EPA will provide the contractor spreadsheets for each chemical with data from ambient water quality criteria documents). The contractor shall generate estimated LC50s using ICE with two methods: (1) using the fathead minnow as a surrogate species, and (2) using ECOSAR (ecological structure activity relationships).  The contractor shall obtain the newest available version of ECOSAR from a free download (http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/newchems/21ecosar.htm).  The contractor shall enter the estimated value and predicted species into each of the ambient water quality criteria spreadsheets provided by EPA.

ACE shall be used to estimate chronic toxicity values from the raw mortality data supplied by EPA, using all three of the ACE analysis routines (ALT, LRA, MPA).  The contractor shall enter the estimated and actual chronic toxicity values into a summary spreadsheet, along with identifying information (species, duration, endpoints, data source).

The contractor shall conform to the following Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedure: (1) data supplied by EPA shall be entered into separate excel files for each chemical and species, (2) hard copies of the entered data shall be checked against the original data, and (3) analysis results shall be double checked against the original ACE and ICE output. 

DELIVERABLE – The contractor shall supply EPA an electronic copy of all entered datasets, and all entered ACE and ICE results, and corresponding documentation. All electronic data shall be in Microsoft excel. Electronic documentation shall be in Microsoft Word format. The contractor shall return all hard copies of data supplied by EPA, and shall delete all electronic files when the project is completed. Electronic deliverables shall be transmitted to EPA employees via email, hard copies shall be returned via postal service.

POSITION DESCRIPTION: Senior Democracy and Governance Advisor and Team Leader

A. BACKGROUND

The USAID Mission to the Kingdom of Nepal has a 50 year track record of assisting with improving the quality of life of people in the country.  Currently, the USAID/Nepal Mission Strategy addresses Nepal’s most pressing development challenges in the context of a ten-year old conflict with political, social and economic elements.  The root causes of the conflict have been exclusion, lack of representation, poor service delivery, poverty, and corruption. The key actors – the King, Political Parties, and the Maoist rebels – are at an impasse, which has led to political instability.  

USAID/Nepal is in the process of developing a three-year strategy (2006-2009) to help achieve the goal of a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Nepal.  Assistance is targeted to address key development challenges in conflict, health, economic growth, and democracy and governance.  Democracy and Governance (DG) is a critical area of focus in Nepal, where the restoration of democracy is a major US foreign policy objective.  A stable democracy and good governance are essential in creating an environment for peace and a resolution of the conflict.  

B. BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION 

The Democracy and Governance program falls under the management of the General Development Office (GDO), which also includes programs in economic growth and agriculture.  The Senior Democracy and Governance Advisor will serve as the DG Team Leader and as Acting General Development Office Director in the director’s absence.  The incumbent will advise the USAID Mission on all issues and programs pertaining to democratic development and DG programming.  The position plays a leading role in strategic planning and donor coordination, report writing, as well as in managing DG resources, working with implementing partners, and supervising the DG team.  The incumbent will report directly to the Director of the GDO, and indirectly with an open channel to the USAID Front Office (Mission Director and Deputy Director) on DG matters.  And as DG Team Leader he/she will be responsible for managing the DG team comprising of one high level USPSC and four senior FSNs (Foreign Service Nationals).  

The current DG program is comprised of the following activities:

-	Strengthening rule of law and anti-corruption
-	Supporting elections and political processes
-	Improving capacity for natural resource management /local governance
-	Combating trafficking in persons

USAID/Nepal envisions expanding these activities in the new strategy period.

The Senior DG advisor will be the Team Leader of the DG portfolio, and will provide technical oversight and oversee staff management of all activities.  In addition, the Senior DG advisor will serve as Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) directly responsible for managing some of the activities within the DG program.  

This position requires broad exercise of individual judgment in setting priorities, managing resources, implementing programs, and coordinating relations with high-level representatives inside and outside the USG.  The political and governance issues that the incumbent will be dealing with are of the highest priority to the US Mission in Nepal.  The environment is unpredictable and the incumbent must be flexible and able to adjust to rapidly changing circumstances. The position also has a broad range of complex managerial, analytical and informational responsibilities, including providing overall direction for achievement of USAID DG objectives, as well as data collection, monitoring & evaluation, documentation, reporting, responding to queries from various sources, coordination, advice and management of the Mission’s DG programs.

ANSWER:  Yes, all certified HUBZone Small Business companies meeting the size standard may submit a proposal.


QUESTION:  Has the data to be entered into the GIS system already been collected?  If so, is it survey accurate?  If not, will we need to provide surveying services to collect the data or will old data be used to convert to a GIS system?

ANSWER:  The baseline data, known as the Common Installation Picture [including facilities that are typically viewed for reference by all functional communities at a given installation, including an overhead satellite image or aerial photograph], have been collected.  Data for other GIS layers [known as Mission Data Sets] are being added as time and resources permit.
 
 If so, is it survey accurate?  Some of the data are survey grade, some are not.  We have the GIS hardware and ability to collect survey grade data and are doing so as time and resources permit.
 
If not, will we need to provide surveying services to collect the data or will you just use old data and convert to a GIS system?  The best answer to this question is that the work required under this solicitation is for ongoing GIS support.  There are some data collection requirements, but there are also GIS services (mapping, data conversion, data standards support, etc.) as noted in the announcement.  We have a mature system with a number of existing professional civilian and military support personnel.  This requirement is for additional support.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NUMBER 6 TO RFP-623-P-00-06-00001 USAID/SUDAN FIELD OFFICE COMPOUND RENOVATIONS IN JUBA, SOUTH SUDAN.

Questions and Answers:

QUESTION 1).
Are there any drawings available for the existing compounds and buildings thereon. ANSWER [NO.]
QUESTION 2)
Standard form 1442: Solicitation, Offer and Award shows that an offer guarantee (Bid guarantee) is not required.  [Correct]
Item I.4 52.228-1: Bid guarantee requires 100% of the bid price. This seems an excessive requirement. Please clarify your exact requirements including whether an insurance bond from a reputable company would be acceptable if a bid bond is required? ANSWER [Bid guarantee will not be required]
QUESTION 3).
Standard form 1442: Solicitation, Offer and Award shows that the performance and payment bonds are to be furnished in 5 days whereas item I.4 (d) states 10 days. Please clarify which is to apply 5 or 10 Days? ANSWER[10 days]
QUESTION 4).
Section C states that the Contractor shall design and construct the complex in accordance with the requirements stated in Section J, Technical requirements. As this is a renovation project and USAID is supplying ALL materials for the Permanent Works and requires a 90 day completion it presupposes that design work has already been carried out to cater for the Clients needs, to allow the procurement of all materials required for the project and that the Contractor is only to implement the works. Section J includes a description of the work but confuses the issue of who is supplying materials. Please clarify the design aspect and confirm that ALL permanent materials are to be supplied by USAID. Please also confirm that all materials will be delivered in Containers which will be stored on site until the materials are required to be incorporated in the works. ANSWER[all permanent materials will be supplied by USAID], STORAGE ARRANGEMENT WILL HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT BY USAID.]
QUESTION 5).
The drawing included for the perimeter wall type DS-50 does not tie up with the security fence reference type S-1 (items 124a and b in your schedule of work). Can you please clarify that a 1.00 metre high anti ram wall is your full requirement? Your entrance gates are minimum 2.75 m high. ANSWER [The one meter height is above grade (1.8 minimum height) is the anti ram section only which will be class 25 concrete..  The wall will extend another 1.7 meters which will be brick or other locally available material.]
QUESTION 6).

QUESTION 8).
Item 1.5 Prompt payment states 14 days for payment after the billing office receives a proper payment request. Addendum 1 item 13 states 30 days. Please confirm whether 14 or 30 Days applies?ANSWER [30 days]
QUESTION 9).
Item I.6 If there are items required in the technical specification which are not included in the estimates sheet how are these items to be shown and included (i.e. planter box protection, safe area steel plating etc.)ANSWER [Items not included will be negotiated with the contractor based on the dayrates provided.  The dayrates must be in line or compatible with the bid.]
QUESTION 10).
Item 1.6 Which drawings are we expected to receive from the Contracting Officer? ANSWER[none except Security fence]
QUESTION 11).
Addendum 1 item 1.2 Housing and food for two inspectors. Are there any published minimum standards required? Please advise us where to look if there are any. Please also confirm that the timescale would be just prior to the commencement of the permanent works until completion. ANSWER [same standards as your senior staff on site or AFEX camp.]
QUESTION 12).
Addendum 1 item 5.0 (c) Please confirm exact definition of SRWF. ANSWER [SRWF is shatter resistant window film or Mylar window film  which will be provided by USAID]
QUESTION 13).
We have noticed the use of the terms, ‘Notice to Proceed’ and ‘Award of Contract’,  have been used interchangeably. They do have an implication on the contract period and the subsequent contract value. Kindly clarify the meaning of these two terms, and further clarify what a ‘Notice to Proceed’ entails and how it is issued. Is it documented or is it verbal? ANSWER [Notice to proceed will be in writing and after USAID as confirmed enough of the materials are on site to start work.  The contract may be awarded earlier so the winner can start planning.]
QUESTION 14).
The Standard Form Paragraph 13. B states that the contractor is not required to provide an offer guarantee for the bid. However, section 1.4 52.228-1 (a) notes that failure to furnish a bid guarantee in the proper form and amount at the set time of opening of the bids, may cause rejection of the bid. Kindly clarify the above ambiguity. ANSWER [Bid guarantee not required but performance bond is required.]
QUESTION 15).
Kindly provide a list of the of the insurance companies and banking institutions approved by USAID, for purposes of getting the bid guarantees, and the performance bonds. ANSWER[We do not recommend or have an approved list.  Your bond company will have to meet international standards and be approved by USAID]

QUESTION 16).
We would like to introduce a clause providing for a Payment Guarantee, by the client, THE Government, to the contractor incase of award of the contract. ANSWER [No]
QUESTION 17).
Section H. Special Contract Requirements. H.4. Logistics Support, states that the contractor shall be responsible for furnishing all logistical support in the US and overseas. Being a labor only contract with the client supplying all the permanent materials, we seek a clarification on the extent of the contractor’s participations, in logistical support. ANSWER [Ignore this]
QUESTION 18).
Telephone lines. ANSWER [Telephone installation will be minimal. Allow one technician and one or two helpers two weeks to complete the telephone installation.]
QUESTION 19).
Section H. Special Contract Requirements. H.4. Logistics Support, states that the contractor shall be responsible for furnishing all logistical support in the US and overseas. Being a labor only contract with the client supplying all the permanent materials, we seek a clarification on the extent of the contractor’s participations, in logistical support.ANSWER [Ignore this]
QUESTION 20).
The Technical requirements pg 44 of 49 3.1.10, indicates that all the repainting and re-varnishing shall be in two coats of high quality washable paint supplied by the contractor. Does this effectively make paint a consumable item to be supplied by the contractor? ANSWER [Paint supplied by USAID but brushes, scrapers, wire brushes, etc by contractor]
QUESTION 21).
The standard form under section F9. Level of Effort. It talks of an attachment showing the Level of effort by Labor Category. There is no such attachment. Kindly advice. ANSWER [ignore this section]
QUESTION 22).
Sections 3.1.9 and 3.1.10 ANSWER [Clarification.  USAID will supply paint.]
