<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for U.S. NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.<br />U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>

<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): November 12, 2018</p>
<p>- NCIA issues IFB (target): December 2018</p>

Therefore, Prytime Medical is the only manufacturer that can provide ER-REBOA catheters and catheter convenience kits.

<p>ITEM DESCRIPTION- Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement for development and production of an E-TPT to satisfy the operational need of the U.S. Navy to test the AN/ALQ-99 Pod Sub-System. The E-TPT will test to insure ready for issue status of the AN/ALQ-99 and it's Weapons Replaceable Assemblies (WRAs).</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for the supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, Teradyne, Inc., 700 Riverpark Dr., North Reading, MA 01864-2634, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a). This is being sole sourced because savings to the Government by leveraging off the existing Teradyne High-Speed Subsystem (HSS) hardware design currently in production for the NAVAIR PMA-260 Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS), ancillary test unit for accommodating high speed test signals. Commonality of parts will provide a cost savings to the Government over the expected 20-year E-TPT lifecycle. Additional savings will be achieved by utilizing the OEM's HSS Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) part management program, and HSS software reuse, which limits develop time, non-recurring engineering costs, and software maintenance in the out-years. Overall, this will prevent substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and prevent unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency.

The magnitude of construction for the above referenced project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  The Construction Period services are expected to begin following the issuance of the Construction Notice To Proceed.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price Contract will be awarded to the A/E Firm selected for the aforementioned design services.  The most highly qualified A/E Firm will be required to participate in a Preproposal Conference prior to the submission of price proposals.  Any cost associated with the participation in the Preproposal Conference is not reimbursable.  Contract award is subject to the availability of funds for FY 2019.

Please note this is not a request for proposal.  Eligible responses received will be evaluated and the most highly qualified will be compiled on a shortlist of candidates who will be contacted for an interview.  The following evaluation criteria, listed in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate firms and determine the most highly qualified firm for possible contract award. The Professional Qualification and Specialized Experience/Technical Competence (i.e., Evaluation Factors #1 & #2) factors are slightly more important than the other six factors (i.e. Evaluation Factors #3, #4, #5, #6, #7 and #8).  

1.  Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services:  This factor evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the design team.  The firms should provide information on the individuals from each relative discipline that are anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the design team.  The key positions should include Project Managers, Quality Assurance Managers, Architect, Plumbing Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Structural Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Fire Protection Engineers, Interior Designer, Estimator, Environmental Engineers and strong familiarity in sustainable design and energy efficiency.  

2.  Specialized Experience and Technical Competence in the type of work required: This factor evaluates the experience of the firm and design team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for this contract. This project will remodel the old surgery area for Specialty Care. This project will aid the medical center in designing a Veteran-centric health care system with the required infrastructure to help Veterans navigate the healthcare delivery system and receive coordinated Specialty Care. This project should reduce waiting times by addressing non-face-to-face care. This project supports Specialty Care programs. Specialty Care is fast growing and is a multidisciplinary approach to our Veterans Health Care needs. Specialty Care has outgrown its current space and needs to expand into the old Surgery space.  Extra consideration may be given for experience designing projects for Department of Veterans Affairs Facilities, especially Operating Room design experience.  The intent of this project is to provide the Government with constructible documents detailing how to accomplish the above; it is estimated that approximately 366 sf of Common space will also have to be renovated. It is estimated that the total renovated space is approximately 8,274 sf. The exact allocation of space remains to be determined. Design shall plan to install insulation within interior walls for sound dampening and to help with temperature control; install energy efficient lighting; replace pneumatic heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) with Direct Digital Control; and plan to fix lack of insulation problem with window frames.  Firms may submit any other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in Specialized Experience.  

3.  Past Performance on Contracts with Government Agencies (particularly Department of Veterans Affairs) and Private Industry in Terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules:  This factor shall be evaluated based on the information provided by the A-E on similar type projects, performance appraisals on file with the Department of Veterans Affairs, any Government sponsored performance rating system and contact with personnel listed in the SF 330 regarding past performance as well board members personal knowledge of the firm.  

4.  Capacity to Accomplish the Work in the Required Time:  This factor evaluates the ability of the A-E firm, given their current projected workload and the availability of their key personnel, to accomplish the projects in the required time.  

5.  Location in General Geographical Area of the Project and Knowledge of the Locality of the Project:  This factor evaluates the distance from the A-E firms design office from the location of work (James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center), and knowledge of the geographic area.  The personnel identified as the key design team staff are expected to work in the design office identified for evaluation of this factor.  

6.  Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.  

7.  Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.  

8.  Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.

Phasing shall be incorporated into the design to minimize disruptions and coordinate infection control, safety and security related items. Must have experience providing drawings in Autodesk s AutoCAD Architecture, MEP 3D, and Revit.

Scope of Work

The A/E will furnish design services, technical specifications, working drawings, cost estimates, as-built drawings, construction period services, and site visits for NRM Project # 503-15-103, " Renovate Specialty Care", at the VA Medical Center in Altoona, PA.  The A/E shall provide a design for a construction contract that will provide for the following requirements: 

This project will remodel the old surgery area for Specialty Care. This project will aid the medical center in designing a Veteran-centric health care system with the required infrastructure to help Veterans navigate the healthcare delivery system and receive coordinated Specialty Care. This project should reduce waiting times by addressing non-face-to-face care. This project supports Specialty Care programs. Specialty Care is fast growing and is a multidisciplinary approach to our Veterans Health Care needs. Specialty Care has outgrown its current space and needs to expand into the old Surgery space.

This project will renovate each room in the old Surgery area for Specialty Care: namely Rooms 341, 342, 342A, 342B, 342C, 345; 345A, B & C; 357; 357A, B, C, D, H & J; 358; 359; 360; 361; 386G; 362; 363; 364; 365; 366; 366A, B & D; 367; 368; 368A; 369; 369A & B; 370; 370A & B; 371; 372 & 386F. It is estimated that this project will renovate approximately 7,908 sf of the old Surgery space for Specialty Care.

To accomplish the above; it is estimated that approximately 366 sf of Common space will also have to be renovated. It is estimated that the total renovated space is approximately 8,274 sf. The exact allocation of space remains to be determined. Design shall plan to install insulation within interior walls for sound dampening and to help with temperature control; install energy efficient lighting; replace pneumatic heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) with Direct Digital Control; and plan to fix lack of insulation problem with window frames.

The project is to improve patient, visitor, and employee environment and increase patient, visitor, and employee privacy. This project improves potential compliance deficiencies with safety standards. The hazards encountered by patients subject them to safety hazards not present in other locations. Support service functions (trash, medical waste, logistics, and engineering) are busy and constant during normal business hours and the area is not customer friendly for patients, visitors, and employees. This project will help alleviate the above noted conditions.

Consideration is to be given for women/family Veteran groups and family restrooms.

Energy conservation measures will be exercised in the project. The renovations will replace antiquated heating and ventilation systems with upgraded and ASHRAE 90.1 Energy Efficient systems. Plan to install insulation within interior walls for sound dampening and to help with temperature control; install energy efficient lighting; replace pneumatic heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) with Direct Digital Control; and plan to fix lack of insulation problem with window frames. Plan to install more efficient water system. From this, the energy engineer, Doug Pollock, calculated the numbers shown on the energy tab of the Gap Support tab.

Parking won't be affected.

Specialty Care and Common space will be impacted.

Preliminary Requirements include but are not limited to: 

The A/E shall investigate existing spaces and systems prior to 25% submission and provide a detailed analysis of existing system at the 25% review meeting. 

At the 50% submission, the A/E shall have all major components identified including architectural, HVAC, electrical, and telecommunications. All components shall have an associated product data sheet and cost to be included in the handbook and cost estimate.

During the 50% submission design review, the A/E shall present on project phasing and shall be fully developed at the 75% design review.

The Government must retain rights to all associated software and have full access to all elements of the System. At no point can the Government be locked out of the System.

<SUBJECT>The Dalles Gate Repair Pit Upgrades
<SOLNBR>W9127N19R0019
<RESPDATE>103018
<CONTACT>Charles Boswell, Mr., Phone 503-808-4609, Email charles.boswell@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Northwestern Division, Portland District (CENWP) is soliciting a two-phase DESIGN-BUILD contract for the upgrade of The Dalles Gate Repair Pit. The proposed project will be a competitive, firm-fixed price (FFP) contract. The requirement is to upgrade The Dalles Lock and Dam Gate Repair Pit located approximately 2 miles east of the city of The Dalles, Oregon.
<p>The existing gate repair pit does not provide efficient working conditions for the maintenance of gates and bulkheads. While the facility is now usable to a limited degree, the inefficiency and potential hazards of the facility cause unnecessary risks to worker safety, and increase maintenance labor hours more than necessary. The upgrade will bring the gate repair pit into full compliance with EM 385-1-1 requirements, and provide efficient systems and access to reduce maintenance labor.</p>
<p>The gate repair pit at The Dalles Powerhouse is used for the maintenance for five different types of gates and bulkheads, which can measure 23 feet wide by 45 feet tall. These specific types are intake gates, intake bulkheads, fish turbine bulkheads, fish turbine gates, and station service bulkheads.  The District conducts routine and non-routine maintenance in the gate repair pit, including but not limited to replacing seals and anodes, replacing corroded section joint bolts, replacing the lifting eyes. Additional work is occasionally required to meet modified criteria, or to restore coatings and/or fasteners.</p>
<p>The proposed project consists of a design-build construction process. The proposed project is the design and construction of renovation upgrades to an existing gate repair pit. The existing concrete gate repair pit is located within a large dam structure and serves as the repair location for multiple styles of gates. The gate repair pit is approximately 41 feet wide, 67 feet tall, and 15 feet deep. There are seven elevated walkway levels horizontally outlining the inside of the gate repair pit. The elevated walkway levels are spaced vertically approximately seven and half feet apart. Gates are placed into the gate repair pit through deck hatches located in the ceiling of the gate repair pit. The elevated walkways provide workers access to all levels and sides of the gate being repaired. Access to the elevated walkways is by ladders attached vertically to the wall. The proposed project requires the renovation/ replacement of the existing walkways to meet horizontal clearance distances between the walkways and style of gate being repaired. The walkways will need to be adjustable to accommodate different size gates while still maintaining safe clearances. The ladders for accessing the elevated walkways need to be redesigned. The renovation upgrades also include horizontal stabilization of the gates, while in the gate repair pit, to withstand earthquake loads. Additionally, the proposed project requires egress and access improvements, upgrades to hoisting, lighting, power, redesign of ceiling deck hatches, and the compressed air and welding system. Improvements to the heating and ventilation system will be required under the proposed project.</p>

<SUBJECT>Fiscal Transfer Agent (FTA) Services for the SBA 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program - 2019
<SOLNBR>73351019C0009
<RESPDATE>111218
<CONTACT>Cheryl T. Flanagan, Contracting Officer, Phone 3038442035, Email Cheryl.Flanagan@sba.gov
<DESC>Purpose of this Notice: This notice is a Sources Sought Notice. It is for market research only, and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). Responses to this Notice will allow the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to obtain a better understanding of the marketplace and to make appropriate acquisition decisions.
<p>Agency Background: The SBA was created in 1953 as an independent agency of the Federal Government to aid, counsel, assist, and protect the interests of small business concerns, to preserve free competitive enterprise, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation. The SBA helps Americans start, build, and grow businesses. Through an extensive network of field offices and partnerships with public and private organizations, SBA delivers its services to people throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the U. S. Virgin Islands, and Guam.</p>
<p>The SBA 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program Background: The SBA works with banks to provide loans to small businesses that might not otherwise be able to obtain financing. The SBA 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program (7(a) Program) is authorized by Congress and is one of SBA's flagship efforts to expand small business access to capital. The 7(a) Program is SBA's primary program for helping start-up and existing small businesses with guaranteed financing for a variety of general business purposes. The SBA does not make loans itself, but rather guarantees loans made by participating lending institutions.</p>
<p>Secondary Market Background: Lenders who hold business loans guaranteed by the SBA's 7(a) Program may sell the guaranteed portions of those loans in the secondary market. The Fiscal Transfer Agent (FTA) administers the secondary market portion of this program.</p>
<p>A lender first agrees to sell the guaranteed portion of a particular 7(a) loan to a particular Purchaser. The FTA administers the settlement of this sale. At settlement the Purchaser receives an SBA Guaranteed Interest Certificate. The Lender remains responsible for servicing its sold SBA-guaranteed loans. Guaranteed portions of payments are forwarded by Lenders to the FTA. Upon receipt of payment, the FTA handles the proper application and dispersal of the proceeds, and coordinates certificate record-keeping.</p>
<p>The FTA also serves as the primary hub for the review and processing of SBA pool applications from approved SBA pool assemblers. The FTA, on behalf of the SBA, issues certificates representing interests in pools of SBA Guaranteed Interests. The FTA provides general administration of the Pools, which includes the processing of payments to Pool investors.</p>
<p>This contract will provide all services related to the provision of SBA FTA functions for the secondary market program of the SBA 7(a) Guaranteed Loan Program. The contract will include services associated with the receipt, verification, collection, and transmission of loan data and program fee payments tied to 7(a) Program.</p>
<p>Contract/Requirement Background: The SBA has a need for professional support of the secondary market for the 7(a) Program. Contractor will serve as the FTA and perform all FTA functions. See the attached draft Performance-Based Statement of Work (SOW) for contract description of the FTA roles, delineated tasks, and overall requirements and performance standards. A separate outline/table of contents for the SOW is also attached.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 523991, Trust, Fiduciary, and Custody Activities, with a size standard of $38.5 Million. The Product Service Code is R499, Support - Professional - Other.</p>
<p>For this contractual need, the Contractor is compensated by firm-fixed fees generated from the loan activities and with interest earned on funds held prior to transmission - and not with appropriated dollars. The estimated value generated to the Contractor per year for this effort is $40 million to $45 million, but will vary depending on overall loan and secondary market activity. Contractor is not to provide any pricing information at this time.</p>
<p>A new contract to support the 7(a) Secondary Market Guaranty (SMG) Program is contemplated for a base year and six option years, to be awarded this fiscal year. It is expected that this contract will be competed full and open - due to the insurance, bonding, IT investment, security, and level-of-effort required to service the 7(a) guaranteed loans and the secondary market. However, the SBA is interested in better assessing the breadth of companies that can provide the highest level of successful service as required by the SBA in the delivery of the defined functions in the SOW.</p>
<p>It is expected that a solicitation for this contractual need will be issued on or about November of 2018.</p>
<p>Response Requested: Contractor's response shall include the following information, in the following order:<br />1. The full name of Contractor, Contractor's DUNS number, address, two points-of-contact with both email addresses and telephone numbers;<br />2. Contractor's socio-economic status and the related NAICS codes for which Contractor is registered in the System for Award Management (SAM);<br />3. A description of Contractor's core business, including its core competencies and services it currently provides. <br />4. A Description of Contractor's relevant experience in performing services covered by NAICS code 523991. Include any relevant contract numbers, Government or business names of parties, periods of performance, and value of contract. Include any GSA Schedule or other Government contracting vehicle to which contractor is a schedule holder or party. For each contract reported, include whether Contractor was the Prime Contractor or a subcontractor, the number of transactions performed in a typical 24-hour period, nature of transactions, the financial precision required for transactions, and the time allowed for each transaction.<br />5. A description of Contractor's insurance and bonding capabilities; and<br />6. A description of Contractor's information technology (IT) facilities and abilities. Include information on Contractor's IT security and on Contractor's professional capabilities as they relate to the SOW requirements.</p>
<p>Response Format and Dates: Responses shall be in English, printable by electronic media on one side of the paper, use 12-point font of any type, and be either single or double-spaced. Responses shall be sent as a pdf file attachment to an email to the Contracting Officer's email address no later than the date and time provided in this notification. The responses shall be limited in size to (1) 10 pages printed on one side, and (2) 10 megabytes total - including both email message and attachment - in order to protect the Contracting Officer's email capacity. Do not include formatting that requires large megabyte support. Any graphs or tables included count toward the page limitation and must be easily readable.</p>
<p>General/Related Information: A solicitation is not being issued at this time, and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment of any nature by the Government. No contract will be awarded as a result of this Sources Sought Notice. A request for solicitation documents will not receive a response. All costs associated with providing information as requested by this Sources Sought Notice shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. This Notice does not restrict the Government in any way to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p>Submit the information requested above (response) by email to Cheryl T. Flanagan, Contracting Officer, cheryl.flanagan@sba.gov , no later than 3 p.m., Mountain Time, on November 12, 2018.</p>

<p>Reference: www.census.gov/naics/ and http://www.sba.gov/contractingopportunities/officials/size/index.html]</p>
<p>FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply to this contract and be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>It is requested that interested parties submit a brief capabilities package. The package shall address, at a minimum, the following:</p>
<p>(1) Examples of projects worked within the last five (5) years of a similar size, scope, complexity and duration as the work indicated. State whether your firm worked as a prime or subcontractor, contract value, brief description of how the referenced contract relates to the work described, and provide an agency or owner point of contact.</p>
<p>(2) A narrative describing how you would implement quality control under this contract, including how you would manage subcontractors, to ensure timely delivery of quality work.</p>
<p>(3) Company profile, to include number of employees, annual receipts, office location(s), and DUNS number.</p>

<p>(5) A positive statement of your intention to submit a proposal for this requirement if set-aside for your socio-economic group.</p>
<p>(6) Return of attached questionnaire with your company's response to this Sources Sought Notice.</p>
<p>The capabilities package requested under this Sources Sought Notice is not expected to be a proposal, but rather a short statement regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing expertise and experience in relation to this procurement. Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the capabilities package. Submission of a capabilities package is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the GSA in tailoring its requirements to be consistent with industry standards.</p>
<p>Responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall be emailed to Simeon Berry at simeon.berry@gsa.gov.</p>
<p>Responses must be received on 10/30/2018, no later than 2:00 pm, Local Time. Electronic submissions will be accepted. Questions regarding this notice may be addressed to Simeon Berry at simeon.berry@gsa.gov.</p>

<DESC>During the week of 1-5 April 2019, DoD's Weapons, Sensors, and Autonomy Communities of Interest (COIs) have joined together to sponsor the crosscutting <strong>2019 Weapons - Sensors - Autonomy Communities of Interest (CoIs) Independent Research &amp; Development (IR&amp;D) Technology Interchange Meetings (TIMs)</strong> being held in parallel with the National Defense Industrial Association's (NDIA) 20th annual Science &amp; Engineering Technology (S&amp;ET) Symposium in San Diego, CA. The venue is expected to be the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley, San Diego, CA. The invitation is open to all industry IR&amp;D participants, including large and small businesses, as well as academia.
<p>This IR&amp;D engagement has broad goals to increase awareness, stimulate collaboration, and seek alignment between industry's IR&amp;D innovative portfolios and DoD's high-priority science and technology needs. Leading Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from DoD's Weapons-Sensors-Autonomy CoIs are expected to participate.</p>
<p>The 2019 Weapons-Sensors-Autonomy CoIs IR&amp;D TIMs will focus on the following crosscutting focus areas:<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Processing</span></strong>. This is a new <strong>Sensors</strong> subarea, with strong <strong>Weapons</strong> and <strong>Autonomy</strong> components. Radio Frequency (RF) and Electro Optics (EO)/Infra-Red (IR) target ID, cross cueing and sensor fusion, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for real time target detection, classification, tracking. Target detection for bi-Static and multi-Static radar, Autonomy focus that automates the battlefield, with advanced algorithms, augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, and asymmetric vision.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operations in controlled, degraded, and operationally limited environment</span></strong>. <strong>Weapons</strong> and <strong>Sensors</strong> interest. Natural and manmade obscurants continue to trouble even modern sensors. Need for Active/Passive multipurpose sensing &amp; Advanced 3-D Read-Out Integrated Circuit (ROICs) for multifunction capabilities. Seamless synthetic reality on immersive heads up displays is also of significant interest.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Open architecture with ensured cyber resiliency</span></strong>. <strong>Autonomy</strong> focus with <strong>Weapons</strong> and <strong>Sensors</strong> application. Formally composable software systems which provide rigorous principled guarantees for autonomous systems using the architecture (i.e., interoperability, safety, functionality, flexibility, etc.). Seamless interfaces, data exchanges between/among heterogeneous resources/assets and needs for human-machine interface (minimizing risks in semi-autonomous systems) call for standards in system architecture including languages, governance, and operational protocols. Innovative approaches are needed to identify critical elements of the analytics enterprise and employ a hierarchical hardening methodology.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Networked Precision &amp; Accuracy</span></strong>. <strong>Weapons</strong>, with <strong>Sensors</strong> and <strong>Autonomy</strong> applications. Seekers, datalinks, control methods that are robust in adverse weather, can exploit multiple tactical and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) networks, ad-hoc secure adaptive networks, decentralized path planning and cooperative control algorithms. Autonomy governed by data fusion can form the central theme for an enterprise system of systems-level architecture. Some of the key considerations from an analytics standpoint are accuracy/precision, risks, latency, and above all, adequacy and sufficiency for acceptance.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Independent Verification &amp; Validation (IV&amp;V)/Trust for Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence Weapons.</span></strong> <strong>Autonomy/Weapons</strong> interest. Methods, Metrics, and Tools.

<DESC><div>NASA is hereby requesting information through this notice from interested parties for the following: Industry and other potential partners to participate in NASA's Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Grand Challenge.<strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>Background </strong></div>
<p>The NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) remains committed to enabling new, transformational commercial aviation markets and services with the potential to provide significant societal benefits.  In recent years, NASA has strategically invested in technical challenges focused on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), UAS Traffic Management (UTM), system-wide safety, vertical lift, noise, electrified propulsion, airspace operations, and tools and capabilities to support new aircraft development.  These efforts are all examples of well-defined problems that NASA has engaged with diverse partners to achieve specific goals.  NASA plans to build on this past experience and lessons learned to help advance the UAM industry.  UAM is emerging as one of the most exciting frontiers in aviation history, and the UAM ecosystem and its associated technologies are likely to be among the most complex aviation has ever seen.</p>
<p>The ARMD UAM vision is to revolutionize mobility around metropolitan areas by enabling a safe, efficient, convenient, affordable, environmentally friendly, and accessible air transport system.  NASA is committed to working with the emerging UAM community to identify and address the key challenges ahead.</p>
<p>In order to most effectively advance UAM, NASA is planning to host a series of UAM ecosystem-wide Grand Challenges to promote public confidence in UAM safety and facilitate community-wide learning while capturing the public's imagination.  NASA anticipates hosting the first of these Grand Challenges, GC-1, as early as the end of calendar year 2020.  GC-1 is anticipated to challenge industry and other community participants to address foundational issues related to UAM vehicle design readiness and robustness for UAM operations.  Following GC-1, future challenges in this series are anticipated to address key safety and integration barriers across the UAM ecosystem while also emphasizing critical operational challenges, such as commercial viability and public confidence in UAM operations around populated areas.</p>
<p>NASA is seeking highly motivated participants in the Grand Challenge series with the desire of achieving commercial operating capabilities.  This is not anticipated to be a monetary award challenge, but rather the Grand Challenge will provide participants the opportunity to demonstrate their fieldable systems in a representative UAM environment.</p>
<p>NASA is releasing this RFI in conjunction with an industry day that can be referenced at https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=57bbdeecd8e64a6a083ecb19e660cfdb&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0 and https://www.nasa.gov/uamgc.  The industry day will be hosted in Seattle, WA at the Seattle Marriott Waterfront on November 1-2, 2018.</p>
<p>While the Industry Day will allow NASA to have an open interchange with the UAM community and clearly communicate the most recent plans for the UAM Grand Challenge, the responses to this RFI will allow NASA to obtain a more in depth look into the status of the industry and ensure the UAM Grand Challenge addresses the broader community's needs, including understanding critical UAM barriers and how to potentially overcome them.  The primary goals of the RFI process are to:<br />&bull;	Collect industry and broader community input to help refine and optimize the Grand Challenge to best enhance and add value to industry efforts in accelerating UAM.<br />&bull;	Allow the government to assess the state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art of the UAM ecosystem, including vehicle development, airspace capabilities development, and community integration.<br />&bull;	Gauge the level of interest from the UAM community in participating in the Grand Challenge, their ability to bring vehicle, airspace and infrastructure assets, and their anticipated capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>FAA Coordination</strong><br />NASA and the FAA are planning to collaboratively develop and implement the Grand Challenge series.  NASA plans to share RFI responses, data collected, and lessons learned with the FAA throughout the Grand Challenge effort.  NASA intends for the Grand Challenge to address information requirements and provide lessons learned to inform FAA policy decisions on safety, certification, operations, and airspace integration aspects of Urban Air Mobility.<br /><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grand Challenge Overview</strong></p>
<p>For the Grand Challenge to be successful, NASA is expecting to partner with industry and other UAM community collaborators that are highly motivated to achieve a commercial operating capability through necessary technology development, testing, regulatory efforts, and other essential activities to enable safe commercial operations.  The collaborations NASA feels are essential to make the Grand Challenge most effective include: <br />1)	Vehicle developers providing functional UAM vehicles equipped with critical subsystems with a threshold level of demonstrated airworthiness.<br />2)	Airspace management system developers providing airspace and air traffic management (ATM) technologies and services built and simulated to a threshold level of UAM airspace management system requirements.<br />3)	The FAA to provide recommendations, guidance, and coordination with NASA.<br />4)	Other UAM stakeholders including the general public, supporting infrastructure providers, standards organizations, local regulatory authorities, etc.</p>
<p>Vehicle and airspace participants will each be challenged to complete a series of common safety and integration scenarios.  These scenarios are designed to represent real-world UAM operations and barriers necessary for certification and operational approval.  An initial draft of the Grand Challenge scenarios is provided in the "UAM Grand Challenge Scenarios" attachment, and it is expected that these scenarios will evolve over time as the Grand Challenge is further defined and the UAM ecosystem progresses toward operational maturity.</p>
<p>GC-1 is anticipated to provide a "proving ground" for vehicle developers to individually demonstrate the design readiness and robustness of their vehicles. The flight demonstrations from GC-1 will help inform means and methods of compliance development with the FAA, standards development, desired future airspace services, and airspace management system requirements.  Future challenges in the series are anticipated to directly address complex integrated system-level scenarios necessary for UAM markets to be realized.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle Developers Envisioned Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Vehicle developers are expected to provide and operate functional UAM vehicles with a demonstrated level of airworthiness.   Participating vehicle developers will:<br />&bull;	Provide vehicle design, development, and test data to support the NASA airworthiness requirements.<br />&bull;	Conduct prescribed flight tests to benchmark vehicle performance and flight characteristics, including demonstration of the ability to safely handle failures and contingencies.<br />&bull;	Conduct safety and integration scenarios for the Grand Challenge including pre-defined interfaces with airspace management systems.</p>
<p>Vehicles that are proposed for inclusion in the Grand Challenge must be representative in size and configuration of a UAM system.  For example, in GC-1, the minimum passenger carrying vehicle size would be one that has a payload capability of at least one person even if the vehicle were to be flown unmanned during the Grand Challenge.  Sub-scale vehicles could be accepted in GC-1 if the vehicle meets the minimum size requirement (i.e., the ability to carry a payload equivalent to one person) and the company demonstrates a commitment and path to a full-scale UAM vehicle.</p>
<p>As part of the vehicle design readiness and robustness scenarios for GC-1, vehicle companies would be expected to demonstrate the full extent of their flight envelope, plan and fly predictable trajectories within required and desired performance metrics, predict and measure energy (e.g., battery and/or fuel) reserves, demonstrate noise, operate in winds, perform balked landings, and handle other simple failures and contingencies such as engine/motor out.</p>
<p>Beyond GC-1, future Grand Challenges in the series are anticipated to address key safety and integration barriers across the entire UAM ecosystem to emphasize critical operational challenges towards UAM operations around populated areas.  Additional integrated vehicle, airspace, and community integration scenarios will likely demonstrate: interactions between vehicles and both traditional and UAM airspace management systems; the ability to detect and avoid other aircraft and hazards; handling the loss of primary communications, navigation, and surveillance capabilities; public acceptance or response to vehicle noise; etc.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Airspace and Air Traffic Management Service Suppliers Envisioned Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Airspace and air traffic management companies and providers are expected to bring technologies and services built and simulated to be compatible with a baseline UAM ATM system design.  These airspace and air traffic management participants will:<br />&bull;	Provide UAM ATM technologies that are compatible with a baseline UAM ATM system design and interfaces.<br />&bull;	Demonstrate capabilities that meet benchmark performance and connectivity requirements though simulations or live testing.<br />&bull;	Conduct safety and integration scenarios during the challenge, including pre-defined interfaces with vehicle systems.</p>
<p>GC-1 will likely implement a baseline UTM system with minimal UAM ATM system components.  Company-provided UAM ATM services may be able to be implemented as a part of GC-1 scenarios in a "shadow mode" where they would receive live data and be asked to generate acceptable responses to the safety and integration scenarios, but would likely not directly influence the operations. A caveat to these statements may include a concept where vehicle and airspace management service suppliers team and create a single unified concept of operations for GC-1.</p>
<p>In Grand Challenge scenarios beyond GC-1, airspace companies would perform airspace management functions that could include: flight plan services, weather services, surveillance services, scheduling services, contingency management, separation services, UAM port operations, etc.  It is possible for airspace providers to partner with vehicle developers to interact in real-time with the vehicle interface to perform the challenge scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Community Integration</strong></p>
<p>Societal integration and acceptance of UAM operations including public acceptance, supporting infrastructure, operational integration, and the local regulatory environment are of paramount importance for UAM to be realized.  The UAM Grand Challenge has potential to include and showcase many mutually beneficial activities.  Examples might include infrastructure concepts such as UAM ports (i.e., vertiports, skyports, heliports, etc.) and charging stations being provided by partners, a public outreach campaign targeted at public confidence and acceptance, a strategic partnership with standards and operational organizations, local regulators' assessment of local regulations, and demonstrations of capabilities and benefits of future Smart Cities.</p>
<p><strong>NASA Airworthiness, Airspace System Interfaces, and Relevant Test Environment</strong></p>
<p>NASA believes that to successfully conduct a UAM Grand Challenge as soon as 2020, essential interfaces and expectations must be available quickly.  For GC-1, NASA believes the critical components are: airworthy vehicles; interfaces between vehicles and a basic UTM system; a set of common safety and integration scenarios; a common set of data collection capabilities; and a set of common range requirements to support participation by non-NASA test range providers.  For Grand Challenges beyond GC-1, each of the elements above will progress as system-level requirements for vehicles, airspace systems, and test ranges are matured toward the goal of enabling testing of robust and scalable UAM operations.</p>
<p><strong>NASA Airworthiness</strong></p>
<p>For companies who plan to have a business model of passenger carrying aircraft, NASA anticipates providing a man-rated Airworthiness and Safety Review process even if there is no pilot onboard (either during the Grand Challenge or in anticipated future operations). The goal of the airworthiness process is to provide a flexible, risk management-based review that ensures the vehicle is airworthy and can be operated safely with the highest probability of mission success. The process will assess, communicate, and accept the residual risks of vehicle test and operation.</p>
<p>Airworthiness and safety of the vehicle will be evaluated by an independent review team based on the company's derived standards. Attached is NASA's "AFG-7900.3-001" document that can be used as a reference for an airworthiness and flight readiness process. In Appendix B of the "AFG-7900.3-001" document there are sample questions that a review board would ask the company; some of these questions may not be applicable to all vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Interfaces</strong></p>
<p>NASA anticipates providing a set of interface requirements and Interface Control Documents (ICDs) specifically for the Grand Challenge for vehicle and airspace providers to interact with a UAM ATM system.<br />For GC-1, it is expected that a UTM system will be provided that UAM airspace and air traffic management stakeholders can utilize in GC-1 to start developing the essential interfaces needed for Grand Challenges beyond GC-1, as well as eventual UAM operations.</p>
<p>For future Grand Challenges, airspace and air traffic management systems developed by Grand Challenge participants will be encouraged. The interface requirements between vehicles and the UAM ATM system will allow vehicles to communicate with the airspace management system in standardized formats and perform functions necessary for UAM operations, such as: filing flight plans, obtaining flight approval, maintaining situation awareness of relevant airspace usage and restrictions, obtaining weather information, etc. The interface requirements between UAM airspace service providers and the UAM ATM system will allow extended services, such as weather, surveillance, scheduling, and conflict management.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant Test Environment</strong></p>
<p>In order to provide the airspace complexity desired for the more advanced scenarios (which will be described in the following section), it is anticipated that the Grand Challenge series will incorporate aspects of a Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) environment. An LVC environment enables the integration of live flight assets with virtual aircraft in a virtual airspace in order to ensure safety of the participants, aircraft, and test range while providing an environment that is relevant to each specific Grand Challenge scenario.<br />For GC-1, the LVC requirements are anticipated to be minimal. For Grand Challenges after GC-1, NASA may provide a testbed infrastructure that incorporates representative airspace, virtual elements, and core airspace and aircraft connection infrastructures to collect necessary data to evaluate aircraft and airspace performance. Connection and data collection requirements may vary based on the nature of a specific scenario and are planned to be defined as part of each scenario description.<br /><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Range Requirements</strong></p>
<p>NASA is planning to provide a test range option for challenge participants and is currently considering hosting the Grand Challenge at Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB); however, NASA would consider other test ranges that might be interested in building range capabilities for hosting the Grand Challenge, including company owned or preferred flight locations. The long-term goals of the Grand Challenge series include ensuring there is a national capability that allows UAM developers to test complex scenarios required for vehicle and airspace system development, testing, and verification in an on-demand nature.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenge Scenarios</strong></p>
<p>The Grand Challenge consists of a series of "scenarios" that will provide participants with the ability to demonstrate the capabilities of their systems as a part of a broader, integrated UAM system. These scenarios will progress in difficulty and complexity, including starting with vehicle-only and airspace system-only scenarios and moving toward challenges that will require integration between vehicle and airspace systems and are representative of UAM operations around populated areas.</p>
<p>For GC-1, which is planned to be hosted in the late 2020 timeframe, vehicle participants will each be challenged to complete a series of performance characterization and safety-focused scenarios with a primary goal of helping move these vehicles toward certification. These scenarios include demonstrating the vehicle's performance and flight envelope over nominal UAM-like missions and in off-nominal situations, such as the loss of an engine or motor.</p>
<p>Following GC-1 by approximately one year, a second challenge, GC-2, is planned to challenge both vehicle and airspace participants to complete a series of common safety and integration scenarios. These scenarios are designed to represent real-world UAM operations and help address barriers to certification and operational approval.</p>
<p>For Grand Challenges that may occur beyond GC-1 and GC-2, it is anticipated that vehicle and airspace participants would each be challenged to complete a series of more complex scenarios that build upon previous scenarios, focus on increased technological capabilities, and demonstrate an increased ability to operate in real urban operating environments and the National Airspace System.</p>
<p><strong>Respondent Expectations</strong></p>
<p>NASA anticipates a substantial response from the entire UAM community. The primary participant(s) for the Grand Challenge will be asked to meet a broad set of criteria. In order to ensure a broad cross-section of the UAM community is represented, NASA is encouraging responses from many different types of service developers and providers to this RFI. Potential partners who may consider responding include the following sectors of the UAM community:<br />&bull; UAM vehicle developers/operators<br />&bull; Aircraft sub-system developers<br />&bull; Airspace system developers and airspace service providers<br />&bull; UAS avionics and middleware industry representatives<br />&bull; Ground and aircraft sensor manufacturers<br />&bull; Communication/navigation/surveillance service and equipment providers<br />&bull; Test range operators and other entities that could provide a test range for GC-1 or future challenges in the Grand Challenge Series<br />&bull; Ground station system and vehicle command and control developers<br />&bull; Ground infrastructure (e.g., UAM port) developers and operators<br />&bull; Other organizations that can make significant contributions toward the GC goals. Organizations could include: local and state governments, universities, Smart City planners, etc. <br />&bull; Additional UAM stakeholders<br />Sub-component suppliers for vehicle and airspace capabilities are encouraged to respond to this RFI; however, they will likely need to partner with a vehicle or airspace system provider to participate in the Grand Challenge.<br />Foreign respondents electing to participate in the Grand Challenge will be subject to additional requirements. These are requirements initiated outside of NASA and include, but are not limited to, the Wolf Amendment (Public Law 112-55, SEC. 539) and personnel access requirements to facilities not owned by NASA. There are no restrictions on foreign companies responding to this RFI, but NASA's subsequent interactions with foreign companies submitting responses could be limited by the above requirements.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">is offering the opportunity to commercialize LLNL&rsquo;s novel method to prepare SiO2-TiO2 composite and SiO2@TiO2 core-shell aerogels with high thermal stability and enhanced photocatalysis for environmental remediation and solar</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> energy conversion processes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Background</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">TiO2 is a widely studied metal oxide metal semiconductor that shows promising performance as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for energy and environmental applications such as organics pollutants photodegradation for air and water purification, photo-assisted removal of toxic heavy metals and production of solar fuels by water splitting and CO2 reduction. The possibility of utilizing TiO2 based materials in such applications drives great interest and intense research efforts dedicated to the development of titania nanomaterials with tailored properties in order to maximize photocatalytic activity, in particular high surface area, good crystallinity and controlled crystalline phase composition.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Aerogels are a class of nanoporous materials prepared by the controlled drying (usually, by supercritical drying) of wet gels formed by sol-gel derived inorganic or organic crosslinked networks. Controlled drying avoids shrinkage and pore collapse, preserving the fine pore network structure in the dried material, and thus resulting in a highly porous low density solid. Given their unique textural and structural properties, TiO2 aerogels are interesting choices for development of high performance photocatalysts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">It is important to develop alternative and improved strategies to prepare SiO2@TiO2 aerogels in order to further expand their applicability as thermally stable photocatalysts.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Description</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Livermore researchers have developed two novel TiCl4 based non-alkoxide sol-gel approaches for the synthesis of SiO2/TiO2 nanocomposite aerogels. Composite SiO2-TiO2 aerogels were obtained by epoxide-assisted gelation (EAG route) of TiCl4/DMF solution in the presence SiO2 aerogel particles. Additionally, the same TiCl4/DMF solution was employed to prepare SiO2@TiO2 aerogels by a facile one-step thermo-induced deposition (TID) of TiO2 on silica wet gels supports. After controlled drying in supercritical CO2, high surface area silica-titania aerogels were obtained as fine powders (EAG route) or as crack-free monoliths (TID route).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Advantages</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The prepared materials show photocatalytic activity higher than TiO2 aerogels, as well as great thermal stability, displaying anatase nanocrystals (9-15 nm) even after thermal treatment at</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">1000&deg;C. Such improved structural property results in the further improvement of photocatalytic activity of SiO2/TiO2 aerogels after high temperature annealing (to as high as 1000&deg;C), which in sharp contrast to the behavior of unsupported TiO2 aerogels.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Potential Applications</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>

<DESC><br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source award by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements to: University of Florida, 1523 Union Rd Rm 207 Gainesville, FL, 32611-1941 , for NIST Wind Tunnel Testing for Investigation of Hurricane Maria, for a period of Not Exceed 42 months.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541330 Engineering Services, and the size standard is 15 million dollars.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide wind tunnel testing services and field measurements of winds in Puerto Rico to support the NCST study of Hurricane Maria's impact on Puerto Rico. The principle objectives of this contract are to characterize the influence of topography on wind speeds in Puerto Rico and to evaluate the resulting wind effects on buildings during Hurricane Maria. The U.S. Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will study the impacts of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico, focusing specifically on the performance of critical buildings and their dependence on distributed infrastructure (such as electricity and water), as well as emergency communications and the public's response to those communications. Under the National Construction Safety Team (NCST) Act, signed into law in 2002, NIST is authorized to establish teams to investigate building failures that have resulted in substantial loss of life or that posed the potential for substantial loss of life. Based on a preliminary reconnaissance to Puerto Rico in December 2017, the NIST Director authorized the NCST investigation to determine:<br />&bull; the characteristics of the storm hazards-the pattern, location and cause of injuries and fatalities;<br />&bull; the performance of emergency communications systems and the public's response to such communications; and<br />&bull; the performance of representative critical buildings and designated safe areas in those buildings, including their dependence on infrastructure such as electricity and water.</p>
<p>University of Florida is the only vendor that has the unique capabilities and resources of the Self-Configuring Hybrid Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel (BLWT) at the University of Florida, which is an Experimental Facility of the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) funded by the National Science Foundation (https://ufl.designsafe-ci.org/). <br />University of Florida's Terraformer is the only system that precisely translate and rotate roughness elements to control height and orientation, to achieve precise control and simulation of upwind terrain surface roughness to meet the NIST requirement. The roughness elements are arranged in a staggered pattern, with a spacing of 300 mm in both the along-wind and across-wind dimensions, and the fetch extends 18.3 m along the length of the tunnel.<br />Their Multi-Fan Flow Field Modulator, a computer-controller array of 319 modular hexagonal aluminum ducts containing ducted fans with high-performance motors driven by electronic speed controllers, to be integrated into the upwind portion of the wind tunnel, in series with a bank of eight 1.5 m vaneaxial fans, to achieve high-resolution control of the flow field which is capable of meeting NIST's requirement.<br />A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to abdul-kudus.yahaya@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted so that they are received at abdul-kudus.yahaya@nist.gov no later than October 22, 2018 at 3:00 PM Eastern Time.</p>
<p><br />NOTHING HEREIN SHOULD BE MISCONSTRUED AS A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS, QUOTES OR BIDS. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE NOR IS ONE INTENDED TO BE ISSUED.</p>

<DESC>On 12 October 2018, the AUSTRALIAN AND UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTS WILL HOST A ONE-DAY INDUSTRY DAY event in Darwin. 

Under the United States Force Posture Initiatives (USFPI), both Australia and the United States are funding and delivering construction projects. The US Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) is the organization responsible for the delivery and management of the US funded projects. Two US funded USFPI projects were recently awarded by NAVFAC an Aircraft Apron and an Aircraft Maintenance Support Facility. This Industry Day is being held to best prepare Australian businesses for working with NAVFAC on future US MILCON projects in Australia.

This event is open to all parties on a space available basis and will be of interest to businesses that have participated in recent NAVFAC procurement processes for projects at RAAF Base Darwin as well as those interested in providing construction services to NAVFAC in the future.

There will be sessions on:

<DESC>This is a notice of the Government's intent to solicit, negotiate and award to only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The source is:
<p>DREDGE CONSTRUCTORS, LLC<br />998 GOLD RIDGE RD <br />SEBASTOPOL, CA 95472</p>
<p>NAICS 333999</p>
<p>The requirement is for:</p>
<p>14 EA -  Vosta, Straight Universal Coupling, SUC 32 inch quick-connect<br />2 EA - Vosta, Outer Suction Liner, 900mm<br />2 EA - Vosta, Throat Liner, 900mm</p>
<p>Business Size: Small.</p>
<p>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) dredges discharge material through discharge pipelines. In order to facilitate safe and quick assembly and disassembly of the pipelines, Vosta LMG developed quick-connect couplings to serve as a break joint that can be quickly and safely un-coupled while partially submerged in water. The Vosta system is currently installed on the dredges included in this requirement. The couplings are required to be suitable for submersion in water and also suitable for use in steel pipeline dredging applications. Vosta's proprietary design incorporates a system that can be quickly operated by crew while the pipe line is partially submerged, without the need for heavy and cumbersome air tools. The Vosta LMG design minimizes exposure of crews to hazardous river conditions during the assembly and disassembly of both floating and steel pontoon pipeline systems.</p>
<p>Similarly, Vosta LMG pumps are aboard USACE dredges which contain various wear parts within the system. The outer suction liners and throat liners are required to be replaced once their useful life has been expended. OEM parts are required to ensure safe, reliable, and efficient operation of the dredge pump systems. Non-OEM parts are unable to meet the needs of the Government.</p>
<p>As of 2016, Vosta LMG does not participate in the U.S. market, and Dredge Constructors LLC is the sole rights holder of the design and technical data required to manufacture and sell the OEM parts listed above.</p>
<p>A request for quotes will not be issued.</p>
<p>If any responsible source believes it has the capability to fulfill the requirements above, it may submit information which shall be considered. Responses must be received by 10/30/2018 at 2:00 PM EST. Telephonic submissions will not be accepted. The point of contact is Dillon Lucas and can be reached via email at Dillon.m.lucas@usace.army.mil.</p>

<p>Background/Overview:</p>
<p><br />The laser capture microdissection (LCM) system is being purchased for the US Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) at Ft. Sam Houston, TX. USAISR requires a process to capture specimens from cryosections, FFPE (formalin fixed and paraffin embedded) materials, native tissue like fresh plants, live cells and chromosomes allowing an investigator to define cells and tissue regions precisely, ensuring exact and reproducible results, without contamination. With the increasing use of histological samples at USAISR we require a system that allows for the simultaneous processing of tissues for multiple applications. Equipment is needed that allows for laser capture microdissection (LCM) and analysis for DNA, RNA and protein isolation, whether from archive material or live cells. A system is needed that combines LCM with an integrated imaging workstation and also be used for cryosections, including FFPA tissue. It is desired where it can be proformed even from standard glass slides, e.g. archived material.</p>
<p>USAISR requests a purchase of a laser capture microdissection (LCM) system from Carl ZEISS Microscopy, LLC.  ZEISS PALM Microbeam ensures ultra-pure sample isolation from living or fixed samples using a high quality imaging platform. The patented laser light-based catapult technology enables contamination-free specimen capture. PALM Microbeam features an optimal workflow from individual to automated experiments. The intuitive user interface allows for simple system calibrations and settings adjustments. Suitable Applications include DNA, RNA, and protein analysis, regenerative medicine, stem cell research, and molecular pathology.</p>

<SUBJECT>Tele-Sleep Decision Assist Tool
<SOLNBR>MTEC-19-02-Tele-Sleep
<RESPDATE>111418
<CONTACT>Rebecca Harmon, Phone 843-760-3358, Email rebecca.harmon@ati.org
<DESC>The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this announcement for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) entitled, "Tele-Sleep Decision Assist Tool." The military is focused on scaling-up the availability of behavioral sleep intervention services to relieve the growing pressure on its workforce and assist in the physiological and psychological restoration of active-duty personnel prior to redeployment or transition into the civilian workforce as veterans. The objective of this upcoming RPP will be to provide a solution that reduces time commitment, minimizes travel, eliminates inconvenience, and enables practitioners not specialized in behavioral sleep intervention to provide treatment. <br /><br />Technical Background:<br />Sleep management is a high priority of the military to optimize Warfighter performance, remain safe, and potentially, reduce the likelihood of psychological issues downstream. Personnel with sleep deprivation are likely to perform at a suboptimal state, both mentally and physically, which jeopardizes themselves, their companions, the mission, and the general effectiveness of the military unit.
<p>According to the National Sleep Foundation, "85% of active duty Service members have been diagnosed with a sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea or insomnia." Studies have also shown that up to 40% of returning personnel have sleep disorders that can lead to depression and anxiety, as well as contribute to other medical disorders, such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes.</p>
<p>Currently, behavioral sleep interventions are recommended as the first-line of treatment of such sleep disorders, such as relaxation training, stimulus control therapy, sleep hygiene, etc., and many have shown improvements in patient outcomes in the clinic. However, the success of many of these therapies is limited due to: i) an insufficient number of clinicians and sleep clinics specializing in behavioral sleep interventions; ii) a large number of patients seeking treatment (high demand, low supply), and iii) a current practice that relies on multiple visits of face-to-face sessions with the clinician to reach an acceptable patient outcome. The time commitment, travel, inconvenience and general lack of trained practitioners contributes to the limited accessibility of these valuable interventions and leaves many patients with untreated sleep disorders.</p>
<p>Project Objective:<br />This RPP will focus on the transition of evidenced-based behavioral sleep interventions for application to the military population to address the limitations of current practices. Therefore, a solution is required that reduces time commitment, minimizes travel, eliminates inconvenience, and enables practitioners not specialized in behavioral sleep intervention to provide treatment. To accomplish this objective, this RPP will require that Offerors address the following tasks in their proposals.<br />Task 1: Develop a "telehealth" device or alternative means (such as an "app") that provides scalable behavioral sleep intervention methods to a military-relevant population. <br />Task 2: Conduct a clinical study that demonstrates the potential of the "telehealth" device or alternative means (developed in Task 1) to provide behavioral sleep intervention to a military-relevant patient population. <br />Task 3 (To Be Determined By Offeror): Interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br />Financial Framework: <br />The U.S. Government (USG) currently has available approximately $4M for Fiscal Years (FY) 18 and 19 to potentially make two awards of $2M each. The period of performance is not to exceed 24 months, but faster timelines are acceptable.</p>
<p>MTEC:<br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and supporting effective materiel life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH-15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). MTEC is currently recruiting a broad and diverse membership that includes representatives from large businesses, small businesses, "nontraditional" government contractors, academic research institutions and not-for-profit organizations.</p>
<p>Administrative Information:<br />Full proposals are due no later than November 14, 2018 at 12:00pm EST. The RPP is posted to the MTEC website (mtec-sc.org) and a notice will be posted to FedBizOpps (fbo.gov) to notify interested parties. MTEC membership is required for the submission of a full proposal in response to this MTEC RPP. Offerors submitting Full Proposals as the prime contractor must be MTEC members of good standing by November 9, 2018. To join MTEC, please visit http://mtec-sc.org/how-to-join/</p>
<p>A Proposers Conference via webinar will be held for interested parties to have their questions answered by the Government after the RPP is posted. MTEC Members will be notified when the Proposers Conference is scheduled.</p>
<p>For inquiries regarding this announcement, please direct your correspondence to the following contacts:<br />&bull; Technical questions<br />Dr. Lauren Palestrini, MTEC Director of Research, lauren.palestrini@officer.mtec-sc.org or <br />Mr. Bill Howell, MTEC Chief Operating Officer, William.Howell@tunnellgov.com<br />&bull; Contracting questions<br />Ms. Rebecca Harmon, MTEC Contracting, mtec-contracts@ati.org<br />&bull; Administrative questions<br />Ms. Kathy Zolman, MTEC Program Manager, kathy.zolman@ati.org<br />&bull; Membership questions<br />Ms. Stacey Lindbergh, MTEC Executive Director, execdirect@mtec-sc.org</p>

The air aviation brigades will be supplied with a kit that resupplies 2 IFAKs based on FORSCOM requirements. <br /><br />Essential Characteristics would be a part of any new procurement and would be presented if an RFP were to be issued to the general public. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The SVMK will be a COTs buy to include commercial off the shelf components that meet the FORSCOM CORPS requirements. If a device is ready for commercialization, it will be allowed</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The SVMK will provide re-supply for IFAKs and CLS bags, as well as hemorrhage control, airway compromise, hypothermia, fracture stabilization and litter transport using a quad-fold litter that can provide evacuation of patients. </span></p>

The kit will be a 4 bag integrated set. Two Combat IFAK resupply bags with 2 IFAK resupply kits in each bag including a first responder blanket to treat shock and hypothermia, one bag for a quad-fold litter, one bag for FoxTrot litter, and a universal extrication pry bar tool. The bags will be required to be connected to each other but allow for disconnection and use individually. The quad-fold litter will work on all ground, rotary- and fixed-winged aircraft, and will be able to meet "safe-to-fly" testing. The quad-fold litter should stow by itself in a maximum of 21"x8"x12" for minimizing volume space claim on platforms. The other bags should connect to the quad-fold bag since it will be the largest bag of the set. If this RFI should become a Request for Proposal, the Contractor that wins this solicitation shall provide a Finite Elemental Analyses (FEA) on the litter for the Government to submit to obtain safe-to-fly certification by the U.S. Air Force (USAF).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently, the only litter that passes safe-to-fly on fixed-winged aircraft, and also works for current ground and rotary-winged aircraft, is the Ability One <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">6530-01-380-7309 Department of Defense Litter. As long as a quad-fold litter can meet or exceed the same design constraints as the 6530-01-380-7309, it should pass safe-to-fly testing. The litter should also shorten to 78" in deployed mode for fitting width wise in some Army vehicles. The current static loading requirement for the 7309 litter is 1600 lbs at the stirrups. The handles are also a constraint for proper securing the patient to all existing litter holding systems. The current diameter of the handles on the 7309 litter work for all platforms. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A way to secure the litter to a platform during CASEVAC should also be detailed in any proposal, such as tie down straps. </span></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">In addition, we are looking for patient litter straps that provide better stability to the patient and minimizes the forward and rearward directions of movement of the patient during transport. The litter strap should have a quick release-disconnect buckle under patient loading (350 lbs) at under 15 lbs of hand pressure without a strap cutter. This litter strap approach should work over the shoulders and legs for better restraint of the patient. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>These straps should be semi-integrated to the litter to save time for deploying. The litter strap should be able to be removable from the litter and also work with a spine board when needed.

<DESC><p align="left">This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and no other written solicitation will be issued.&nbsp; This acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 12 Commercial Items, Part 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and Part 15 Negotioation of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is a Small Business Set Aside.</span></strong>&nbsp;Only small business can participate in this solicitation. Verification of business size will be completed via the vendor's SAM registration.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>No phone calls will be entertained.&nbsp; Questions MUST be emailed to Daniel Kinney at dan.kinney@ars.usda.gov.</strong></p>
<p align="left">The USDA, ARS, U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) requires on-site services to provide an estimated 20,000 gallons of propane fuel by metered vehicles to various locations at the Clay Center, Nebraska facility.&nbsp; Contractor to provide propane storage tanks (approximately 90 tanks, from 125 gallon to 1,000 gallon with the majority being 250 gallon tanks).&nbsp; Propane is used for heating livestock facilities and water tanks throughout the 35,000 acre facility.<br /><br />The period of performance will be from 24 Oct 2018 -&nbsp;30 Sep 2019.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delivery Instructions:</span></strong> Delivery will be made Monday through Friday excluding Federal Holidays at the various sites within the consignee's premises between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Contractor shall provide, with each invoice, delivery tickets, to include total gallons delivered, date and location of delivery. Delivery truck(s) will be required to stop at&nbsp;the U.S. Meat&nbsp;Animal Research administration building&nbsp;upon arrival and departure to obtain special instructions and to verify meter reading. Delivery shall be made within 24 hours of telephone request for additional propane. The number of tanks and their location may vary. The contractor may be required to provide service and tanks at additional locations on the Center. The Contractor will determine the size of the tank based upon the proposed use of the propane (i.e., livestock waterer versus livestock building.)</p>
<p align="left"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pricing:</span></strong> The contractor will need to subscribe to the OPIS Propane Daily. Pricing will be determined by the OPIS contract average rack price for Geneva, NE on the day of propane delivery plus the contractors&nbsp;quoted price to deliver the propane and tank usage at the Center.<br /><br />Hypothetical example, propane was delivered on January 12, 2011. The OPIS contract average for Geneva, NE on that day was 94.467. The contract bid for tank usage and delivery was 23.345 for every gallon delivered to the Center. The price paid to the contractor for every gallon delivered that day would be $1.1782 (94.467+23.345). If the contractor delivered 3,000 gallons that day the invoice from the contractor to USMARC would reflect a total due of $3,534.60 (3,000 x 1.1782(94.467+23.345)).&nbsp; The contractors quote&nbsp;for this contract will&nbsp;include the&nbsp;delivery and usage charge based on a per gallon basis as described above.<br /><br />The following is attached to this posting:<br />-Request for Quote Standard Form 18<br />-Provisions and Clauses<br /><br />Offer Submission Instructions:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Quotes must be submitted via email by 5pm CST, Oct 22, 2018 to Daniel Kinney at the following email address: dan.kinney@ars.usda.gov<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Quotes must be submitted using the attached Standard Form 18 with blocks 13 through 15 completed with vendor information.&nbsp; <br /><br />3.&nbsp; The Government may elect to conduct discussions with offerors whose&nbsp;quotes are technically acceptable (or which may be expected to be made acceptable by moderate modification) and fall within the competitive price range. The Government reserves the right, however, to award a contract based on initial offers without conducting discussions. Therefore, each&nbsp;quote should be submitted from the offeror's most favorable technical and price standpoints.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database as required by FAR 4.1102 at the time of submission. Information on registration may be obtained by calling 866-606-8220 or via the internet at https://www.sam.gov.</p>

<p>The 2019 Bulk Fuel Additives procurement purchase program was originally synopsized under the number SPE602-18-R-0719 on October 2, 2018, however changes were made that required in EBS that automatically made a change to the solicitation number used for this requirement.

For Continental (US) CONUS locations, the delivery method used is tank truck. The specific details will be included within the schedule of the solicitation by product and location. The total estimated quantity is as follows:</p>
<p>FSII - 3,887,000 USG <br />NSN: 6850-01-057-6427<br />MIL-DTL-85470B dated 1 June 1999</p>
<p>CLA - 12,000 USG<br />NSN: 9140-01-628-6264<br />MIL-PRF-25017H (1) dated 2 October 2016</p>
<p>LIA - 80,000 USG<br />NSN: 9140-01-604-2853<br />MIL-PRF-32490 dated 25 February 2014</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>1. The CLA additive is a fuel-soluble corrosion inhibitor/lubricity improver additive for use in aviation turbine fuel, motor gasoline, diesel fuel, and related petroleum products. It is defined by MIL-PRF-25017. Awards will be made only for products that are, at the time of award of contract, qualified and included in the Qualified Products List (QPL) No. 25017 which can be found at http://qpldocs.dla.mil/.</p>
<p>2. The LIA additive is one of two grades of diesel lubricity improver additives that are used in naval distillate fuels conforming to MIL-DTL-16884. It is defined by MIL-PRF-32490. All LIA products offered must be listed on the Qualified Products List (QPL) to be considered for award (link: http://qpldocs.dla.mil/). LIA products not on the QPL list will need to be vetted and approved. Please contact Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, ATTN: SEA 05S, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, SE, Stop 5160, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-5160 or emailed to CommandStandards@navy.mil for vetting process.</p>
<p>3. All offers of products FSII, CLA, LIA, must indicate the product name and product manufacturer in the offer being submitted. All offers with products indicated that are not manufactured by the offeror must include a Supply Commitment Letter with the offer to indicate/verify the offeror's ability to provide products of the type and quantity indicated within its offer. See Section L of the solicitation for the requirements of what must be included in the Supply Commitment Letter.</p>
<p>4. Colonial Pipeline, VA: In addition to the requirements for CLA appearing in Quality Assurance Provision (QAP) C30-2, CLA supplied to this location are required to meet one of the low temperature viscosity requirements specified below. This additional requirement for CLA is due to infrastructure capability restrictions at this location.

<p>a) Dynamic viscosity 450 centipoise (cP) maximum at 0 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by ASTM test method D 2983, or</p>
<p>b) Kinematic viscosity 350 centistokes (cSt) maximum at 30 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by ASTM test method D 445.</p>
<p>5. United Arab Emirates Embargo of Qatar:</p>
<p>Due to the current Qatar embargo issued by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) issued a Notice to Mariner(s) stating that UAE ports will not allow ships to load any cargo from UAE destined for Qatar. The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MOFIC) has declined to issue written assurance that the Notice to Mariner(s) is not applicable to U.S. DOD cargo destined for Qatar. Therefore, all FSII bid line proposals with shipping points or utilizing supply points in UAE will NOT be evaluated to Qatar.</p>
<p>Offerors submitting FSII bid lines with shipping points or utilizing supply points located in nations who are participating in the Qatar Embargo (other than UAE) or are otherwise imposing additional restrictions on shipping product to Qatar must provide documentation from cognizant port authority or management verifying the ability to provide product for delivery to Qatar. If sufficient documentation is not submitted, the bid lines will not be evaluated to Qatar. As of the date of this synopsis, the following countries, in addition to the UAE, have publically cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and/or are participating in the embargo: Bahrain, Comoros, Egypt, Maldives, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, and Yemen. Please note that this list is neither exhaustive nor authoritative, and offerors are responsible for notifying DLA Energy whether the nations in which their shipping points or supply points are located are participating in the embargo or have some other similar restriction on shipping product to Qatar.</p>
<p>6. Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) Requirement: <br />Vendors and subcontractors must be registered in the Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) to be considered for contract awards in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Operation (AOR). CENTCOM-affected offers include the following:<br />a) Offeror physical address is located in CENTCOM<br />b) Offeror is submitting FOB Destination Offer(s) to CENTCOM<br />c) Offeror is submitting shipping point(s) located in CENTCOM<br />U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) includes the following countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.<br />Each offeror must submit its registration number with its offer package.

Please go to www.jccs.gov, http://www.jccs.gov/ then click on "vendor login", click the registration tab, and follow the directions from there.</p>
<p>To be eligible for installation access, Contractors and subcontractors at all tiers are required to register for installation access in the Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) and are responsible for keeping the information in the this system updated at all times. Prime Contractors and subcontractors at any tier may verify their registration at https://www.jccs.gov/jccscoe/ by selecting the "Vendors Login" module and logging in with their user name and password. The offeror must be registered, approved, and eligible for installation access prior to award, and remain eligible for installation access for the life of the contract.<br /><br />The offeror is required to submit a listing of all proposed subcontractors, at all tiers, to the contracting officer with the submission of the proposal, and provide updates during the life of the contract when subcontractors are added or removed. If no subcontractors are expected to perform during the life of the contract, the offeror must submit a negative response to the Contracting Officer with its proposal. After award, the prime contractor must submit a negative response to the contracting officer at the beginning of each performance period.</p>
<p>7. The Military Cargo Preference Act of 1904:</p>
<p>Offerors will be required to adhere to the Military Cargo Preference Act of 1904 which requires that all supplies bought for the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps must be carried solely (100%) on U.S.-flag vessels except in certain circumstances. In addition, Contractors must give the government plenty of notice before a foreign-flag vessel can be waived into service. Specifically, DFARS 252.247-7023 states that the contractor must submit any request for use of other than U.S.-flag vessels in writing to the contracting officer at least 45 days prior to the sailing date necessary to meet its delivery schedules.</p>
<p>8. No Small Business set-asides will be offered for this procurement.</p>
<p>9. The Government reserves the right to make awards based on initial offered prices. Based on this, offerors should ensure all offered prices submitted with their initial offer are its best competitive and final price(s).</p>
<p>10. Proposals submitted electronically through a single e-mail must be no more than 10 MB in size. DLA Energy's mail server will reject messages larger than 10 MB.</p>
<p>11. There is an expectation that the solicitation will be posted in October 2018.</p>
<p>12. Please be reminded, that all offers must be submitted on the Offeror Submission Package (OSP). Please ensure that the OSP is completed in its entirety as it relates to the offeror's offer and that the product being offered must meet the specified requirements for the product itself and any location requirements identified within the line items. The product(s) being offered must be clearly identified in the OSP and indicate what the brand name and product identifier is for the product (i.e., CLA - TOLAD 351).</p>
<p>13. Copies of DLA Energy's Bulk Fuel Additives (FSII/CLA/LIA) solicitation will be available via the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) webpage at www.fbo.gov. A posting notice will be sent to the firms on the solicitation mailing list on the date the solicitation is issued and posted on the FedBizOpps webpage. This posting notice is a courtesy and not a requirement of the Government. It is in a businesses' own best interest to keep checking and review on a regular basis Government Portals of Entry for procurement requirements such as FedBizOpps to ensure it does not miss opportunities that are advertised.</p>
<p>14. For all other questions or concerns e-mail James Forde at James.Forde@dla.mil. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Agency, in order to be eligible for award. Offerors are required to complete, sign, and return their entire proposal, to include the document titled Offer Submission Package (OSP) to the Bid Custodian email box at DLA Energy, BulkFuelsBidCustodian@dla.mil.</p>

(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>8. Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Oct 2014) applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(a) The Government may award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;</p>
<p>(ii) price;</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror in LPTA solicitations.</p>
<p>To be considered a technically acceptable solution for a parts procurement, the quoted parts shall meet the solicitation requirements including required parts, delivery dates, and terms and conditions stated in the solicitation. To be considered a technically acceptable solution for a service, the quoted service shall meet the solicitation requirements including terms and conditions stated in the solicitation. The quote shall state that all aspects of the technical requirement, including required delivery date and part numbers, can be met.</p>
<p>If utilized, a past performance evaluation will be conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3)(ii)(C). The Government intends to utilize the Government Wide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for past performance evaluations as a basis for anticipating successful/unsuccessful performance on this required effort. To be considered acceptable for past performance, a search of the PPIRS must reveal no negative past performance information for the recent and relevant records. In the event there are no recent and/or relevant PPIRS records, the quoter may submit information on recent and relevant subcontracts and/or commercial contracts. If no recent and relevant contracts are available in PPIRS or submitted by the offeror, the quoter's past performance record shall be considered "unknown." In the context of acceptable or unacceptable, "unknown" past performance shall be considered "acceptable." To be considered recent, the effort must either still be in progress or have been completed within the previous three (3) years from date of this draft award notice. To be considered relevant the record should be similar in terms of complexity, scope, and magnitude. "Scope" is defined as experience in areas defined in the SOW. "Magnitude" is defined as the measure of similarity of the volume, dollar value, and/or duration of work actually performed under the quoter's submitted contracts to the SOW. At the quoter's discretion, additional past performance information may be submitted with the quote as a supplement to PPIRS. If furnished, this submission will be evaluated in accordance with the procedures described above.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate quoted pricing for reasonableness utilizing techniques described in FAR 13.106-3. <br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror by the Government within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />9. All Offerors must include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. <br />10.

The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK
Ambulatory Cardiac Telemetry 

Scope of Work:  
Ambulatory Cardiac Telemetry for patients experiencing intermittent symptoms, such as palpitations, syncope, dizziness and shortness of breath. Patients are provided with a sensor and cell phone and monitored in real time via an embedded algorithm and cellular communication. The device must have auto-trigger and auto-send functionality which automatically and instantly detects and transmits both symptomatic and asymptomatic arrhythmia without any patient intervention required.  The device must auto-trigger for atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia, and pause.  Patients must also have manual activation access to transmit the ECG data to the contractor s clinical monitoring facility. 

Upon transmission of the data to VA clinical monitoring facilities, VA clinicians will interpret the ECG and provide a preliminary finding and send the results back to the clinician for review and final diagnosis.  

Patients enrolled by the Gainesville VA clinic in the monitoring service will be shipped a device including all supplemental equipment (i.e. batteries, electrodes, and instructions) for a period up to 28 days of monitoring.  Telephone hook-up and baseline on the device will be scheduled with the contractor following confirmation of mailing address and receipt of the device at the patient s physical address. 

Once the patient has activated the service and successfully baselined the device, the contractor will monitor the patient continuously.  The patient is responsible for ensuring the cell phone remains charged, the batteries for the sensor are changed when needed, and the device is shipped back to the contractor in a shipping package provided with the kit.  

The Gainesville VA Medical Center will establish physician notification criteria for office-hour, 24-hour, and emergency criteria in order to effectively triage data and ensure appropriate patient care.  

The contractor will post all reports on a secure, HIPAA-compliant website for retrieval and download to VA systems. The website must be accredited by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Data Management:  
1. Data Transmission - A phone is provided in the kit that automatically sends data to the clinical monitoring facility.
 
2. ECG Evaluation - Once the ECG data is processed, converted, and ready for evaluation, the company alerts the VA by two methods. The company must call the cardiology department and send the data via fax for prompt evaluation based upon the physician notification criteria referenced above.  
   
3. Documentation - Quality of data must be tested initially when the electrodes are first attached to the patient. The contractor will test the device as well as transmission to the company with the initial baseline

The website must be able to enable cardiologists to have access to the patient s transmission reports available 24 hours a day at the physician s convenience. The site must provide the following data:
Enrollments - Ability to enroll patients directly online. 
Reports   Access to patient reports. Reports must be sortable by preference and printed individually or in a batch mode. 
Contact Us   Ability to communicate directly to contractor s customer service.
Account Info   Ability to view or change account set-up and preferences. 

When the data is interpreted by the cardiologist, a computerized result is generated and added to the VA clinical records. Results must be available within 3-5 days after the final evaluation period.  

Website must be certified FIPS 140-2, level 2 compliant for VA to use it for patient care. Please verify that it is compliant by providing the certification certificate.

Specific information on the reports should include: 
a. Up to 30 days of retrievable ECG data
b. Episode, daily summary, end of service and urgent notifications
c. Heart rate histogram correlated to a-fib, symptoms and activities; this includes easy to read p wave morphology
d. A-fib onset and duration
e. A-fib burden and rate charts
f. Full disclosure report on demand
g. End of study report available within 2 business days from study completion. 

Privacy Requirements:
The contractors shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

The contractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

Information made available to the contractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). 

VA information should not be co-mingled with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. VA reserves the right to conduct onsite inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor shall immediately notify the Cardiology Program Coordinator, COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
The contractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination

The contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer s Representative a copy of the
training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. This is only required for contractor employees that are requiring access to VA information and VA information systems.
Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

<p>Addendum 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items (Oct 2014)<br />2. Basis for Contract Award: A single contract will be awarded to the Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by this solicitation) and is evaluated, based on the evaluation factors, to represent the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal resulting in overall best value to the Government. An order may be awarded to the contractor who is deemed responsible IAW FAR 9.1, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitations's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by the solicitation instructions) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors, to represent the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest complete and reasonable price. Offers will be evaluated utilizing the following evaluation criteria:</p>
<p>A. Technical: The Government will review the contractor's proposed technical approach to verify it will result in successful contract performance. Technical proposals will be assessed in accordance with Table 1 below. The evaluation team shall evaluate the below subfactors and determine Pass (acceptable) or Fail (unacceptable) ratings outlined in Table 1.</p>
<p>i. Management Plan: This subfactor evaluates the contractor's ability to provide a sound and realistic Management Plan to provide services without introducing unacceptable risk. The management plan, or any portion thereof, could become an attachment to the contract at award. The Offeror must provide a Management Plan that demonstrates its capability and capacity to meet the requirements as outline in the PWS to include the appropriate and mix of technical personnel. The offeror provides an organizational chart identifying key personnel with a description of their work experience and all required certifications/licenses required to perform these services. At a minimum, the proposed approach shall thoroughly substantiate all of the following:<br />ii. A block diagram identifying the individuals (management and supervisors) associated with this requirement to include: <br />a) Key personnel: Each individual's name, title, duty, certifications, licenses, years of experience, and experience level relating to similar contracts in size and scope. <br />b) Proof of current licenses and certification from the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation to meet local certification requirements in the maintenance, repair and inspection of Vertical Transportation Equipment (elevators).<br />c) Proof of valid state drivers' license for all vehicle operators, as well as current vehicle registration and proof of insurance. <br />Standard: The management plan shall provide an approach to successfully manage and execute the contract at the acceptable performance level without introducing unacceptable risk. The management plan is acceptable when it successfully meets the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. The offeror demonstrates a sound approach to management throughout the life of the contract. The offeror describes the appropriate number and mix of technical personnel with the required certifications/experience to meet the requirements on the PWS. <br />iii. Quality Control Plan: Offerors shall provide a draft Quality Control Plan (QCP) describing their Quality Management System (QMS). In order to meet the government's quality requirements, a contractor's QMS should be robust enough and resourced adequately to execute four key quality functions: 1) Detection of quality program problems and defects; 2) Identification of root causes for quality related problems/defects; 3) Correction of root causes related to detected problems/defects; and, 4) Follow-up to ensure quality related problems/defects do not recur. Furthermore, a mature QMS requires the contractor be the proactive party on quality. The goal is to obtain performance reflective of continuous improvement with no reliance on COR's surveillance to detect problems/defects, determine root causes, or ensure quality related problems/defects do not recur. After contract award, a finalized Quality Control Plan shall be required from the apparent awardee no later than twenty (20) calendar days after the award of the contract for approval IAW the PWS.</p>
<p>Standard: The quality control plan shall thoroughly substantiate all of the following:</p>
<p>a. A description of the contractor's quality control processes and procedures, including a chart showing lines of authority. The QCP Manager shall report to the project manager or someone higher in the organization. The project manager in this context shall mean the individual with responsibility for the overall management of the project including quality and production.</p>

Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />52.237-1 - Site Visit (Apr 1984)<br />Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable.

(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
(7) The Standard Form 1449.
(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractors representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

<p><br />52.246-2 - Inspection of Supplies -- Fixed-Price (Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />_X__52.204-7 -- System for Award Management   (Oct 2016)<br />(a) Definitions.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place</span></strong>:
<div><br /></div>
<div>Mr. Robson Luiz Schiefler e Silva, Assistant Manager to the Board of Directors <br />Generation and Transmission Directorate <br />E-mail for proposal submissions: robsonl@copel.com <br />Address: Rua Coronel Dulc&iacute;dio, 800 - Batel Curitiba, Paran&aacute;, Brasil, 80420-170 <br />Telephone: 55-41-3310-5050</div>
<p>The Grantee ("COPEL") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop the Copel Cybersecurity Project Technical Assistance.</p>
<p>Brazilian generation, transmission, and distribution companies are adopting automated solutions for their operations and maintenance in order to remain competitive. The increasing adoption of digital and remotely controlled systems has improved efficiencies in the electricity sector in Brazil, but it has also elevated concerns about the sector's resiliency and ability to withstand cybersecurity threats. With the exception of the State of Roraima, Brazil has an interconnected, inter-state transmission grid. Brazil currently has an installed generation capacity of 137 GW and over one thousand transmission substations, resulting in a considerable number of sites in need of cybersecurity protection.</p>
<p>Companhia Paranaense de Energia ("Copel") is the electricity and generation company for the State of Paran&aacute; and has become a national standard for operations automation. Copel has implemented solutions for remote access to substation supervision, as well as other mission critical solutions for its operations. Copel has 38 transmission substations and 21 generation stations and is critical for the energy security of the State of Parana.</p>
<p>Copel seeks Technical Assistance for three main reasons. First, Copel would like to help identify vulnerabilities related to its operational systems, including gaps in its security protocols, processes, regulations, and technologies. It would also help develop an implementation plan for the installation and upgrade of cybersecurity solutions, protocols and procedures, using the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection Plan (CIP) as a reference. The adoption of NERC CIP-based standards would better position U.S. vendors for future procurements.</p>
<p>Second, this technical assistance would develop the specifications and requirements for a follow&shy;on pilot to be implemented directly by Copel, immediately following the conclusion of the technical assistance. The technical assistance would not include the pilot but would provide Copel with the necessary technical analyses to move forward with the pilot. Third, Copel is committed to using the recommendations of the technical assistance to promote and advocate for new cybersecurity regulations in the country. As one of the first major utility-scale cybersecurity projects in the country, this activity is anticipated to be a catalyst for future projects and serve as a model for future standards and regulations.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$601,455 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</span></strong></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-997-2392. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2:00 PM local time in Curitiba, Paran&aacute;, on November 28, 2018</strong></span> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.</p>
<p>The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place</span></strong>:
<div><br />Mr. Nilton C. Marcello, Acting Director
<div>Address: Alameda CESP, sem n&uacute;mero, Fazenda Grande<br />Jundiai SP, Brazil, 13212-437<br />Phone: 55-11-4589-6530<br />nmarcello@isacteep.com.br<br />gcorradin@isacteep.com.br<br />ccezario@isacteep.com.br</div>
<p>The Grantee ("ISA CTEEP") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data</p>
<p>(collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the<br />basis of experience and capability to develop the ISA CTEEP Substation Automation Project<br />Technical Assistance.</p>
<p>Brazil is the largest electricity market in Latin America and the third largest in the Americas,<br />behind only the United States and Canada. The country's generation mix is mostly comprised of<br />large hydro plants and requires long-distance transmission lines to power the country's cities.<br />The electricity transmission sector has increasingly gained importance and the country's federal<br />regulator (ANEEL) now requires that generation projects secure access to transmission lines<br />prior to signing up for electricity auctions in the country, thereby placing new burdens on<br />transmission companies, and increasing the need for them to improve efficiency.</p>
<p>ISA CTEEP is an electricity transmission company based in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo and is<br />responsible for transmitting approximately 24 percent of the electricity produced in Brazil and 60<br />percent of the electricity consumed in the country's southeast region. The company is expanding<br />rapidly and is taking important steps to modernize its transmission assets, mostly acquired<br />from former state-owned companies in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo. ISA CTEEP has invested over<br />$3 .7 billion in these operations since 2008.</p>
<p>ISA CTEEP sees benefits of deploying grid-wide automation technologies with interoperable<br />protocols, as well as self-correcting and remote-controlled capabilities for its operations. As<br />such, ISA CTEEP requested USTDA technical assistance to develop technical requirements,<br />cybersecurity standards, a roadmap and an implementation plan for a series of upgrades to its<br />substations.</p>
<p>ISA CTEEP currently owns and operates 126 substations and over 18,642 kilometers of<br />transmission lines across the country. Meanwhile, the company continues to grow and expand its<br />coverage. As recently as June 2018, ISA CTEEP won a bid to operate additional transmission<br />lines in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo.</p>
<p>Although the company has recently invested in new and modern solutions, these have been<br />installed through small pilots and not in an interoperable fashion, thus hindering the company's<br />ability to fully integrate systems, remotely monitor substation activity, and reduce costly<br />maintenance and inspection dispatches.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place</span></strong>:
<div><br />Mr. Nilton C. Marcello, Acting Director
<div>Address: Alameda CESP, sem n&uacute;mero, Fazenda Grande<br />Jundiai SP, Brazil, 13212-437<br />Phone: 55-11-4589-6530<br />nmarcello@isacteep.com.br<br />gcorradin@isacteep.com.br<br />ccezario@isacteep.com.br</div>
<p>The Grantee ("ISA CTEEP") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data</p>
<p>(collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the<br />basis of experience and capability to develop the ISA CTEEP Substation Automation Project<br />Technical Assistance.</p>
<p>Brazil is the largest electricity market in Latin America and the third largest in the Americas,<br />behind only the United States and Canada. The country's generation mix is mostly comprised of<br />large hydro plants and requires long-distance transmission lines to power the country's cities.<br />The electricity transmission sector has increasingly gained importance and the country's federal<br />regulator (ANEEL) now requires that generation projects secure access to transmission lines<br />prior to signing up for electricity auctions in the country, thereby placing new burdens on<br />transmission companies, and increasing the need for them to improve efficiency.</p>
<p>ISA CTEEP is an electricity transmission company based in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo and is<br />responsible for transmitting approximately 24 percent of the electricity produced in Brazil and 60<br />percent of the electricity consumed in the country's southeast region. The company is expanding<br />rapidly and is taking important steps to modernize its transmission assets, mostly acquired<br />from former state-owned companies in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo. ISA CTEEP has invested over<br />$3 .7 billion in these operations since 2008.</p>
<p>ISA CTEEP sees benefits of deploying grid-wide automation technologies with interoperable<br />protocols, as well as self-correcting and remote-controlled capabilities for its operations. As<br />such, ISA CTEEP requested USTDA technical assistance to develop technical requirements,<br />cybersecurity standards, a roadmap and an implementation plan for a series of upgrades to its<br />substations.</p>
<p>ISA CTEEP currently owns and operates 126 substations and over 18,642 kilometers of<br />transmission lines across the country. Meanwhile, the company continues to grow and expand its<br />coverage. As recently as June 2018, ISA CTEEP won a bid to operate additional transmission<br />lines in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo.</p>
<p>Although the company has recently invested in new and modern solutions, these have been<br />installed through small pilots and not in an interoperable fashion, thus hindering the company's<br />ability to fully integrate systems, remotely monitor substation activity, and reduce costly<br />maintenance and inspection dispatches. This technical assistance would provide<br />recommendations not only for existing substations, but also for substations acquired in the<br />future, or for greenfield projects, as the company continues to expand its coverage area. ISA<br />CTEEP's goal is to deploy the recommended technologies, solutions and protocols for substation<br />protection, control, and monitoring across its country-wide operations in the near-to-medium<br />term.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$488,360 grant to the Grantee from<br />the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the<br />Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are<br />available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22209.

<p>Brazil's water supply infrastructure has been strained in recent years due to urban expansion, decreased precipitation, and limitations imposed on the construction of new water reservoirs. As a result, several Brazilian states are seeking alternative resources and new technological approaches to maintain water supply, such as water reuse technologies. A key example is the Aquapolo water reuse plant in Sao Paulo, which is owned by the Sao Paulo state water utility SABESP. This plant is the largest plant in South America and the fifth largest in the world, and supplies reused water to industrial customers, in lieu of more scarce drinking water or well water. In the neighboring state of Parana, the state water utility SANEPAR, is facing similar challenges, along with increased demand from its industrial customers, who want a sustainable and reliable source of water for various operations, such as cooling, refrigeration, and cleaning.</p>
<p>Acquiring water reuse technologies is a high priority for SANEPAR. The company has mapped current and future demand/consumers, conducted site visits abroad (including to the United States), and developed an initial water reuse plant project concept. SANEPAR has requested USTDA funding for a long-term approach that would initially include a water recycling facility that would utilize a combination of wastewater plus water as feedstock, and a second water recycling plant that would draw primarily from the company's urban wastewater collection infrastructure. The feasibility study would identify initial plant requirements, best suited technologies, provide initial designs, and assess the best rate structure for produced water.<br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$616,951 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22209.

<DESC>The solicitation is amended to address questions from prospective vendors.
Question 1: Is this solicitation a new requirement or is there an incumbent vendor? 
Answer 1: It is a reoccurring requirement for this cemetery and yes there is a contract in place.
Question 2: Related to the above question, if this work is not a new requirement and there is an incumbent vendor, will theNon-Displacement of Qualified Workers Clause52.222-17 be activated?
Answer 2: Yes, the non-displacement can be activated.
Question 3: Line item 0015 in the pricing schedule shows 52.00 Weeks. Should it read 35.00 weeks?

Answer 3: Cleaning of the restroom is a daily requirement; the COR will conduct random inspections any day of the week to ensure compliance and quality assurance of the same. That s why is noted on the price schedule as a weekly item for accountability purposes.

Question 4: Regarding line item 0015 and the Janitorial services required. Can the contracting team please provide square footage of the restroom area and any other pertinent information related to the building necessary for bidding? We will review while on site and will verify numbers in order to work up accurate pricing, but are always appreciative when the information is able to come from the contracting team so as to put all bidders on as equal footing as possible.

Answer 4: They are two public restrooms; 9 x8  each, concrete floors, female restroom has a toilet and a sink; men s restroom as a urinal, a toilet and a sink.
Question 5: Line items 1016, 2016, 3016, and 4016 appear to be missing. Is that intentional or should we include those line items for their corresponding Option years?
Answer 5:  CLIN Item 016 (headstone cleaning) will applied for all option years. 
Question 6: Line Items 0021 and 0022 and their corresponding Option year line items cover the internment of caskets and cremains. These line items estimate 5 services per year. Is that the historical average number of internments per year?
Answer 6: For items 021 and 022 are estimates IAW historical data; the government is requesting the price for each type of interment. These requirements can decrease or increase IAW the cemetery needs and actual interment rate.
Question 7: Related to disinterments and sunken graves. We were appreciative of the attachments to the solicitation which visually displayed the various types of burial situations that one might encounter performing work within a National Cemetery. Where the Baton Rouge National Cemetery is as historic a property as it is; having been built in 1867 to support the burial of Civil War Union soldiers, do the drawings hold true for all of the burial plots at the cemetery or are there others that might fall outside of those drawings that our teams may be called upon to work with?
Answer 7: The government has supplied a site plan than indicates a footprint of the existing burials with a headstone centered at one end of the site indicating the approximate head of the decedent. The indicated footprint is an approximate location as to where the actual container of the decedent is buried. The contractor shall take appropriate care when excavating because the actual container may not be exactly in the location indicated on the site plan footprint. The contractor is responsible for not disturbing adjacent gravesites and burial containers.
Question 8: We understand that one of the key components of this solicitation for the Department of Veterans Affairs and National Cemetery Administration is that the cemetery be in top condition, with healthy grass and other greenery. Is the irrigation system currently in place at the cemetery in working condition?
Answer 8: Baton Rouge NC does not have an irrigation system. However, the contractor will be required and shall provide and utilize portable water tanks and/or water trucks as necessary to transport water to areas where needed in order to complete the work required by this Contract (example headstone cleaning, turf establishment, road maintenance). 
Question 9: How old is the irrigation system?
Answer 9: n/a.

<DESC>DSCOVR Antenna Improvement (DAI) Hurricane Rated (HR) Feed Upgrade
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI). In preparation for upcoming anticipated procurements, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Satellite and Information Acquisition Division (SIAD), on behalf of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), is conducting market research to gather feedback from industry and to assess the marketplace.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) Office of Satellite Ground Services' (OSGS) mission is to sustain current NESDIS capabilities, to enable future capabilities, and to create an integrated ground enterprise. Satellite data acquisition from the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) is a crucial current NESDIS capability.  DSCOVR monitors the magnetic plasma emanating from the Sun and provides this data as a real-time data stream to the NESDIS National Weather Service (NWS) customer, the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). The data is used by SWPC to produce space weather forecasts, watches, warnings, and alerts. DSCOVR is NESDIS' primary real-time solar storm warning system at LaGrange point 1 (L1). NESDIS Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station (WCDAS) is the primary facility for commanding DSCOVR and downlinking DSCOVR telemetry.  Currently, the backup system resides in Fairbanks, AK at the Fairbanks Command and Data Acquisition Station (FCDAS).  <br />NOAA recently conducted the DSCOVR Antenna Improvement (DAI) study to determine the most promising antenna(s) located at WCDAS to modify and serve year-round as the DSCOVR main or backup antenna. One of the driving factors in performing the study was to alleviate the burden of relying on the backup system in Fairbanks which does not provide coverage during the winter months. Additionally, some of the WCDAS antennas need feed and/or horn improvements to achieve the required performance and also need maintenance repairs to be able to support DSCOVR effectively for years to come.</p>
<p>The DAI study recommended upgrading the legacy 16.4M Hurricane Rated (HR) antenna, specifically HR2, to transmit and receive DSCOVR telemetry at the WCDAS facility. The existing HR2 antenna will require either feed modifications or a complete redesign and replacement to enable optimal support to the DSCOVR mission for the long term while retaining coverage of the legacy GOES NOP mission. This upgrade effort will entail design, photogrammetry, and development of the antenna feed hardware and software (if needed) as well as its installation and acceptance testing at WCDAS to demonstrate the specified requirements are met.<br />The project shall modify or replace a Hurricane Rated antenna system, HR2 at Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station (WCDAS), Wallops Island, VA. The contractor shall conduct an onsite assessment survey of the RF Feed and associated assemblies, and perform any modifications, replacements or upgrades necessary to optimize HR2 to support all DSCOVR mission requirements: data downlink, command uplink, ranging and tracking for the long term (5 - 20 years) in service as the primary antenna, as well as to fulfil all existing GOES legacy &lsquo;NOP' mission requirements.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>NOAA intends to issue an RFP for this initiative but given the scope, complexity and variety of design options possible for fulfilling the stated requirements, is issuing this RFI in advance to allow industry Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and prospective bidders the opportunity to conduct a firsthand site visit assessment of the HR2 antenna so as to better inspect its overall condition along with environmental factors, evaluate the current functional architecture and formulate responses to the questions posed in this RFI. These in turn will assist NOAA in refining RFP requirements.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a single, Firm Fixed Price award.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED</p>
<p>If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide a detailed response to the following:</p>
<p>Part 1. Administrative Information</p>
<p>Responses are requested to include:</p>
<p>a.	Contact Information. Provide company name, mailing address, phone number, fax number, company website, CAGE code, DUNS number, and contact information for designated points of contact.</p>
<p>b.	Business Type. Identify your business type and any socioeconomic categories such as Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-owned Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, and 8(a) companies.</p>
<p>c.	Alternative NAICS Code Recommendation, if applicable. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 517919 All Other Telecommunications. The Government may consider recommendations for an alternative NAICS code. If an alternative is recommended, please provide rationale for why the code is more appropriate and applicable to the planned acquisition.<br /> <br />Part 2. Corporate Capabilities and Experience</p>
<p>Responses are requested to include a summary of your business' capability to perform the requirements (reference the attached Draft SOW) and any relevant experience in providing the same or similar services offered to the general public, non-government entities, or Government agencies.</p>
<p>The Government is not requesting generic capability statements, but specific responses tailored to this requirement. Capability statements should address all of the relevant services as detailed in the attached Draft SOW. Capability statements should include objectives that your company can and cannot fulfill. Respondents are requested to respond whether they are capable of fulfilling the entirety of the scope or only a portion therein. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to perform, please include that in response as well.</p>
<p>Experience statements should include relevant details including scope, period of performance, dollar value, client and point of contact information, and any other information relevant to the requirement.</p>
<p>Part 3. SOW Response</p>
<p>Please provide a detailed response to the SOW describing the methodology for either designing a new feed assembly or retrofitting the existing assembly. A cost benefit analysis for the chosen approach should be included as well. Additionally, please provide any suggested changes or modifications to the SOW.</p>
<p>Part 4. Test Description</p>
<p>Please provide factory test description, site integration description, and test plan to meet the requirements of the SOW.</p>
<p>Part 5. Installation and Integration</p>
<p>Please provide a detailed installation and integration plan and procedures for the installation and integration of the provided components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part 6. Questions, Comments, Concerns</p>
<p>Please provide responses to the following questions posed to industry:</p>
<p>1.	When NOAA initially conducted a study for this work, a photogrammetry analysis of the present antenna geometrics was advised.  Is this the most effective path to take or can the work be performed without a full analysis of the present antenna's geometrical characteristics?</p>
<p>2.	One of the study's recommendations was a complete replacement of the HR2 RF electronics.  However, would it be more cost effective to consider reuse of some the existing RF components versus a full replacement and/or upgrade to meet the performance requirements?</p>
<p>3.	A requirement for this project will be to selectively support two NOAA missions, GOES &lsquo;NOP' or DSCOVR, with the HR2 antenna. GOES &lsquo;NOP' presently uses an L-Band co-linear polarization while DSCOVR uses an S-Band circular polarization. While NESDIS had looked at a switchable arrangement could there be an alternate but more cost effective solution i.e. diversity combining circularly polarized signals for L-Band and changing the data receiver for GOES 'NOP' support?</p>
<p>4.	Predicated upon the results of your site survey, review of stated requirements and industry experience, would it be more cost effective to re-fashion and modify existing components of the antenna feed, or perform a wholesale re-design and replacement of the feed?</p>
<p>5.	Predicated upon the results of your site survey, review of stated requirements and industry experience, how long do you estimate it would take to complete this project?</p>
<p>6.	Based upon the results of your site survey, review of stated requirements and industry experience, what possible risks will the execution of this project entail?</p>
<p>7.	Does the general and/or explicit physical location of the antenna offer any logistical and/or technical challenges to execution of the project?</p>
<p><br />After reviewing the attached draft SOW and this RFI, please include any questions, comments, or concerns that should be addressed. All questions received will be gathered, reviewed, and may be answered in a future posting or amendment to this RFI.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Japan District (POJ) is performing market research for a Design-Bid -Build (DBB) construction project titled: "PA00109 DoDEA Replace Kinnick High School, Yokosuka, Japan."  This announcement represents a market survey that is intended for preliminary planning purposes only.  The purpose of this notice is to identify sources capable of performing this project and to receive responses from those firms to assist the Government's acquisition planning.  This survey does not constitute a commitment by the Government for any follow-on announcements, solicitation, or award.  This is NOT a solicitation.  The Government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this market survey.  This market survey is intended for local sources only.  Local sources are those sources physically located and licensed to conduct business in Japan.  Firms interested and capable of performing this work are highly encouraged to submit a response (submission requirements are located within this notice).</p>
<p>Information about the project:</p>
<p>Project Title: PA00109 Replace Kinnick High School</p>
<p>Project Location: Yokosuka, Japan</p>
<p>Project NAICS: 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction</p>
<p>Project Magnitude: Between &yen;10,000,000,000 and &yen;25,000,000,000 Japanese YEN</p>
<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>Construct a four story high school, roughly 14,700 square meters, with functional areas containing neighborhood instructional spaces, special education spaces, staff collaboration spaces, commons area, performance space, information center, physical education, art room, music room, science labs, career technical education labs, junior reserved officer's training corps, administration suite, health suite, guidance counseling suite, special education suite, food service, janitorial workroom, maintenance support, school supply/storage area, technology service center, and other required areas for a fully functioning high school. Typical construction is anticipated to consist of concrete beam and pile foundation, concrete and structural steel frame, and concrete exterior walls. Interior construction will consist of gypsum wallboard partitions, operable/movable partition walls, and reinforced concrete walls.</p>
<p>The project site consists of two separate but proximate sites: the high school building site and Briggs Bay improvements site.  The Briggs Bay improvements construction site is roughly 6.2 hectares and includes play courts (tennis and basketball), playfield, track and field, football/soccer field, baseball and softball fields, fencing, field house building (280 square meters), access road, dog park, and vehicle parking.</p>
<p>Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) principles for high performance and sustainable building requirements will be included in the design and construction of the project in accordance with federal laws and Executive Orders. Low Impact Development will be included in the design and construction of this project as appropriate.</p>
<p>This project will provide Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) features, including design for progressive collapse and blast-rated windows and doors, and comply with AT/FP regulations, and physical security mitigation in accordance with DoD Minimum Anti-Terrorism Standards for Buildings.  Due to the progressive collapse design features of the high school building, the contractor is required to meet the Special Inspections requirements of the contract during construction of the building.</p>
<p>Project includes the construction within the high school building of Designated Seismic Systems (DSS).  DSS are those systems identified in the plans and specifications that must remain operable following a design earthquake.  DSS have special requirements for certification(s) of the installed equipment of the DSS as well as Special Inspection requirements during construction.</p>
<p>Facilities will be designed to provide cyber security engineering and validation as specified in DoD Unified Facilities Criteria.</p>
<p>The project site is on reclaimed land with dredged fill and the project will require deep concrete pile foundations as a special foundation feature due to the un-compacted or non-uniform nature of the underlying soils</p>
<p>The project includes related infrastructure such as water, sewer, steam, electrical, telephone, local area network, community access television systems, provisions for interior and campus wireless access.</p>
<p>The project includes site work such as signage, fencing, paving, landscaping, covered walkways, canopies, exterior lighting, site prep, site improvements, storm water, low impact development, external AT/FP, pedestrian crosswalks, outdoor play areas, athletic fields.</p>
<p>The project will require demolition of approximately 20,000 SF of existing facilities.<br />The project will require hazardous material mitigation for all buildings to be demolished, including asbestos removal. U.S. Federal and Japanese Environmental Laws and Regulations will be followed. Part of the site is on reclaimed land area with Tokyo Bay dredge fill material known as Briggs Bay. Soil contamination levels were determined to be acceptable with the implementation of risk management procedures during construction. Environmental mitigation will be required during construction to monitor, contain and remediate the soils.<br />Facilities will be designed in accordance with DoDEA Education Facilities Specifications, Unified Facilities Criteria, Japan Environmental Governing Standards, Standards of Seismic Safety for Federally Owned Buildings, and energy and water conservation standards.</p>
<p>Facilities will be designed to meet or exceed the useful service life specified in DoD Unified Facilities Criteria. Facilities will incorporate features that provide the lowest practical life cycle cost solutions satisfying the facility requirements with the goal of maximizing energy efficiency.</p>
<p>The government anticipates the Period of Performance will be 61 months.</p>
<p>Procurement method:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Japan District (POJ) anticipates the release of an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for this project.  Any solicitations pursued will be intended for local sources only.  See information in the Introduction section of this announcement regarding local sources.</p>

<DESC><br />Pooling Administrator (PA) Award
<p>The PA contractor administers the national mandate for thousands-block number pooling.  Thousands-Block number pooling is a resource optimization strategy which enables carriers to receive telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000, rather than 10,000, thereby promoting a more efficient and effective use of numbering resources.  Since its implementation, thousands-block number pooling has substantially helped conserve NANP resources, and extended the projected exhaust of the NANP until approximately 2036.  The PA will also functions as the Routing Number Administrator, responsible for administering non-dialable pseudo-Automatic Number Identifications (p-ANIs)</p>

<DESC>Training contract with the Partnership for Public Service (PPS), for the US Department of Education (ED), Office&nbsp; for Civil Rights (OCR), Program Legal Group (PLG). The training&nbsp;will be tailored&nbsp; strengths deployment inventory, effective communication, and emotional intelligence. The purpose of this&nbsp; trianing is&nbsp;to develop strong leaders, improve employee engagement and create a collaborative and innovative organizational culture, to coincide with the ongoing training and&nbsp;development being provided by PPS to ED staff participating in the Excellence in Government program (EIG).<br /><br />PPS is the only recognized not-for-profit organization with the stated mission of making the federal government more effective for the American people. PPS is uniquely positioned to provide continued support and guidance for the cultural transformation effort at OCR and ED. From 2010 to 2018&nbsp;PPS, via a grant through the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation, worked to provide additional training and coaching to PLG in the areas of communication, emotional intelligence and change management to thousands of staff at ED. Through this work, PPS provided support during the presidential transition, developed career executives, provided executive coaching, and has trained hundreds of mid-level leaders through&nbsp;the EIG program, in which several PLG and OCR members have participated. <br /><br />Part one of the proposed training focuses on the the Strength Deployment Inventory (SDI)&nbsp;to help&nbsp;PLG employees&nbsp;better understand their work and communication styles, how such styles vary at work, and how they influence the manner in which employees interact with colleagues. For years, PPS has&nbsp;administrered the SDI to PLG and OCR staff to help them understand&nbsp;these concepts. In addition to simply administering the SDI, PPS is skilled at training employees about their SDI results.&nbsp;Thus, PPS&nbsp;can train&nbsp;the next group of PLG employees&nbsp;on how to utilize this tool, both by providing individual analysis and group assessments&nbsp;to help&nbsp; staff better understand their own and their team's working styles.<br /><br />Part two of the proposed training&nbsp;focuses on&nbsp;two main topics where PLG has current room for growth: communication and emotional intelligence. Here&nbsp;PPS can uniquely focus on the SDI&nbsp;as a measure of individual strengths&nbsp;and weave the SDI lessons&nbsp;into the latter part of the training&nbsp;session focusing on communication and emotional intelligence. <br /><br />Lastly, PPS operates a proprietary database and data analysis tools for the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government rankings. OCR was ranked 337 out of 339 subcomponents in 2017. On average, agencies that have worked with PPS have improved overall satisfaction and commitment by approximately 6% annually. PPS can help PLG staff understand these rankings and work collaboratively with OCR staff to increase overall satisfaction with their work environment.&nbsp;<br /><br />Due to&nbsp;PPS' extensive and specific&nbsp;experience with&nbsp;OCR&nbsp;and&nbsp;PLG,&nbsp;they are&nbsp;is uniquely positioned as the sole vendor to provide the afore-mentioned&nbsp;training and coaching in the areas of communication, emotional intelligence and change management. &nbsp;<br />
