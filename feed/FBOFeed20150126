<DESC>January 26, 2015<br />Requisition #: 15-004213<br />Notice of Intent to Sole Source<br />The National Institute of Health Office of Purchasing and Contracts intends to negotiate and award a contract to Promega Corporation to provide PowerPlex 16 HS 400rxn kits for monitoring patients after allogeneic transplant which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 325413, and the size standard is 500 Employees<br />This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive quotations. Interested concerns capable of providing the same or similar products or services as described in this notice may submit a capability statement outlining their capabilities. No solicitation is available. Information received will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability Statements must be received within the time set forth in this synopsis to be considered by the Government. A determination to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC).</p>
<p>The Department of Laboratory Medicine is in need for the Powerplex 16 system offers a diverse range of loci, providing enough different loci to be statistically relevant, it was fully validated and implemented in Allogeneic Transplant Engraftment Monitoring and is integral to several ongoing protocols in NHLBI and NCI.<br />This kit co-amplifies16 different loci to increase the chance of finding informative allelic differences between recipient and donor. The monitoring of engraftment using STR has been done in the Molecular section of the NIH, CC, DLM, Hematology Service since 2001. A change to current protocols would risk laboratory certification by causing the laboratory to be cited as failing to be compliant to laboratory guidelines established by the College of American Pathologists Accreditation Agency.<br />STR (a) (short tandem repeat) loci consist of short, repetitive sequence elements 3 to 7 base pairs in length. These repeats are well distributed throughout the human genome and are a rich source of highly polymorphic markers, which may be detected using the polymerase chain reaction. Alleles of STR loci are differentiated by the number of copies of the repeat sequence contained within the amplified region and are distinguished from one another using radioactive, silver stain or fluorescence detection following electrophoretic separation. <br />The PowerPlex &reg; 16 HS System allows the co-amplification and three-color detection of sixteen loci (fifteen STR loci and Amelogenin), including Penta E, D18S51, D21S11, TH01, D3S1358, FGA, TPOX, D8S1179, vWA, Amelogenin, Penta D, CSFIPO, D16S539, D7S820, D13S317 and D5S818. One primer for each of the Penta E, D18S51, D21S11, TH01 and D3S1358 loci is labeled with fluorescein (FL); one primer for each of the FGA, TPOX, D8s1179, vWA and Amelogenin loci is labeled with carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine (TMR); and one primer for each of the Penta D, CSF1PO, D16S539, D7S820, D13S317 and D5S818 loci is labeled with 6-carboxy-4', 5' dichloro-2', 7'-dimethoxy-fluorescein (JOE). All sixteen loci are amplified simultaneously in a single tube and analyzed in a single injection.<br />The DLM's Hematology Service provides engraftment monitoring (Chimerism testing) in the clinical laboratory for patients who have undergone allogeneic transplant, as a service to several groups within the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).<br />There are other types of kits that are on the market that utilize STR amplification, however, they either don't amply enough different loci or they amplify more than needed. The PowerPlex HS system has been fully validated for use in monitoring patient engraftment. Switching to another system would entail lengthy validations and would alter current results of our protocols.</p>
<p>All responses are due to the Contract Specialist within seven (7) calendar days from the date of this synopsis.</p>

<p>The Department of Preoperative Medicine is in need of to provide the orthopedic surgeon the ability to perform a Hemi-pelvic reconstruction with iliac wing surgery. This customized pelvic implant, the Pelvic Iliac Wing Silver Treated Surface Coating Implant from Stanmore Inc, gets fixated into the sacrum and the pubic and ischial ramus by 6.5mm screws as well as 3 pins into the sacrum. The device is customized for the patient with a "silver coating" that will decrease the chance for post-op infections. This is an urgent requirement as the patient has a large tumor that is continuing to grow. The patient has already had several radiology procedures to try and decrease blood supply to the area to prevent the rate of growth. Stanmore Group is the only company that provides this specific implant. Silver treated is needed to resist infection in mega-prostheses replacement surgery.</p>

4.	Some modifications will need to be performed with very limited on-site laydown space, while other components requiring modification will require removal from the Shipyard.
  
a.	It is anticipated that these components can be trucked to and from the Shipyard.

The anticipated contract completion date for this construction project is 365 calendar days from date of award.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA).

The Naval Sea Systems Command plans to issue orders on multiple occasions over the period, 18 months, of a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), on an other than full and open competition basis, to General DynamicsBath Iron Works (GD-BIW), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to perform post-delivery engineering and management efforts in support of the LCS 2 and LCS 4.
  Efforts shall include maintenance actions consisting of execution and advance planning of Continuous Maintenance Availabilities (CMAV), Emergent Maintenance (EM), Planned Maintenance System (PMS), Facilities Maintenance (FM), Administration and Engineering Support Services (AESS), and class planning and support services.  This basic ordering agreement will bridge the gap between Post-Interim support services currently being performed under the BOA and the competitive award of the Product Support Plan (PSP) contracts.  As the shipbuilder of the LCS 2 and LCS 4, GD-BIW is the only known source with extensive previous experience necessary to perform these efforts and has developed unique and technical expertise for the design, engineering, construction, and maintenance of these ships.
  GD-BIW is the only known source capable of providing coverage in order to prevent possible disruption in services and unacceptable delays in mission critical efforts necessary to restore or maintain the ship to a fully operational level required to support the Fleet.

The estimated ceiling amount of the BOA is $75M.

The statutory authority for the sole source is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC><p>This is a pre-solicitation notice of a proposed contract action in accordance with FAR 5.201. In support of EO 13360, Service-Disabled Veterans Executive Order, the Contract Management Division (CMD), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), plans to establish DHS department-wide Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for Program Management, Administrative, Clerical, and Technical Services under the program name PACTS Sole Source Contracts. These IDIQ contracts will provide a wide range of services for DHS through four (4) comprehensive functional categories (FC). These categories are 1) Program Management Services (NAICS Code 541611), 2) Administrative Services (NAICS Code 561110), 3) Clerical Services (NAICS Codes 561410, 561421, 561431), and 4) Technical Services (NAICS Code 541330). All services to be provided are non-IT related. These categories will include a full range of services, including but not limited to, financial planning and budgeting, equity and asset management, strategic and organizational planning, business process improvement, human resources, management consulting services, marketing, billing and recordkeeping, physical distribution and logistics, secretarial services, postal and mailing services, office support services, provision of advice, preparation of feasibility studies, provision of technical services during the construction or installation phase, inspection and evaluation of engineering projects and related services, etc.<br /><br />The services to be acquired make up a significant portion of DHS's organizational requirements. Through this procurement effort DHS plans to establish DHS-wide procurement vehicles while supporting DHS Small Business Goals by tapping into an available supply of resources in the SDVOSB community in accordance with FAR 19.14.<br /><br /><br />PACTS Sole Source contracts will promote the use of performance based contracting and accommodate the issuance of task orders for the following pricing arrangements: Firm Fixed Price, T&amp;M, and LH. Specific program or project requirements will be defined in task orders that will be competed at the functional service category level. Task orders will be competed using the Fair Opportunity provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). PACTS Sole Source contracts will have a one year base and two six-month option periods. Individual task orders will have their own performance period requirements, but shall not exceed the IDIQ contract performance period. PACTS Sole Source Contracts will allow for task order performance at any location in the United States (CONUS) or outside the US (OCONUS). IDIQ contracts guaranteed minimums will be set at $250. This amount is intended to provide consideration for the IDIQ award. The scope of the contracts and the limited number of awards will provide each vendor with adequate opportunities to receive task orders.<br /><br /><br />The proposed contract will be awarded using Other Than Full and Open Competition procedures citing the statute authority 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(5) pursuant to FAR 6.302-5(b)(6), Authorized or required by statute under the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 657f). This procurement effort will be set-aside for current Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) under the current PACTS IDIQ who meet the current NAICS code size standard for the specific FC for which they currently have a PACTS contract award. The current PACTS IDIQ Contract holders are:<br /><br />1. Addx Corporation, 2. Best Value Technology, Inc., 3. Centuria, 4. The Costas Group, Inc., 5. CTI, 6. Emesec, Inc., 7. HCI, 8. imPACTS, LLC, 9. Kingfisher Systems, Inc., 10. Klett Consulting Group, Inc., 11. KMEA, 12. Loch Harbor Group, Inc., 13. Longview-Fed Consulting JV, Inc., 14. LRS Federal, LLC, 15.

Ursa Navigation Solutions, Inc., 24. VETCO, LLC, 25. Vet-Fed Resources, Inc., 26. Veterans Enterprise Technology Solutions.<br /><br />This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice nor will it reimburse firms for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>USAID Kyrgyz Republic Mission intends to issue a solicitation to qualified offerors for the USAID Kyrgyz Republic Democracy and Governance Activity to be implemented in Kyrgyzstan.
<p>The estimated cost of the contract is within the range from $9,500,000 - $10,000,000.  The period of performance is anticipated to be five years, beginning on or about September 1, 2015.</p>
<p>USAID/Kyrgyz Republic seeks to strengthen the legitimacy, effectiveness, and accountability of Local Self Governments (LSGs) in the Kyrgyz Republic. Assistance will focus on identifying the most significant legitimacy-effectiveness gaps facing LSG bodies, and improving their ability to execute the devolved functions enumerated by the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Local Self Government.  This purpose will be accomplished by starting with the community's perceived needs, supporting LSGs to address those expectations within the available resources, and by continuing to provide assistance to further improve each LSG's competency and capacity through mechanisms that can and will function independent of future USAID funding.</p>
<p>Performance Objectives<br />Rather than requiring an activity design based on specified methods of performance, USAID requires offerors to propose technical approaches that best achieve the following performance objectives:</p>
<p>1.	Increasing Local Self Government effectiveness, as defined by improved competency, capacity and solutions to perform devolved functions and services, within a community's resource constraints by:<br />1.1.	Increasing staff competency and capacity<br />1.2.	Advancing implementable administrative protocols, processes, and procedures   <br />1.3.	Advancing financially sustainable, local solutions to better deliver a constituency's priority services<br />1.4.	Advancing readily achievable GoKR reforms to improving LSG's effectiveness</p>
<p>2.	Increasing Local Self Government legitimacy, as defined by improved community engagement, responsiveness, and accountability in the implementation of devolved functions and services, incrementally and sustainably by:<br />2.1.	Strengthening all community stakeholders' engagement in LSG planning and execution<br />2.2.	Reconciling community expectations with LSG resource constraints</p>
<p>3.	Furthering and sustaining indigenous Kyrgyzstani Local Self Government support capabilities that are competent and able to provide on-going assistance to communities and their leadership by:<br />3.1.	Collaborating and coordinating with multiple stakeholders such as GoKR LSG-oriented entities, emerging LSG consulting firms, LSGs and their communities, and international donors<br />3.2.	Promoting new and existing products, services, and practices that strengthen indigenous Kyrgyzstani LSG technical expertise and assistance capability<br />3.3.	Ensuring a post-activity mechanism for LSG assistance and support, not dependent on USAID funding, that fosters and leverages indigenous capabilities to promulgate best practices, products, and services</p>

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking expressions of interest for office space consisting of approximately&nbsp;48,000 ANSI/BOMA Office Area Square Feet (ABOASF), and 37 on-site, covered, secure parking spaces in the Buffalo, New York Central Business District (CBD).&nbsp; The office space must be located in one contiguous block of space on one floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a&nbsp;loading dock with the&nbsp;capability to drive a vehicle inside,&nbsp;and secure it after entrance is required&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;an&nbsp;additional 2,000 ABOASF adjacent to the loading dock.&nbsp; The additional ABOASF must have the capability of housing two large&nbsp;vaults measuring approximately 250 and 450 sf.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The proposed lease term is for ten (10) years, five (5) years firm with the Government having cancellation rights after the firm term upon 120 days written notice. <br /><br />The Government intends to use this information from prospective sources to issue a Request for Lease proposals (RLP). <br /><br />Buildings offered for consideration must be within the Buffalo Central Business District, and have the ability to meet all current Federal/GSA/PBS, State, and Local codes and regulations including, but not limited to fire safety, accessibility, and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease.&nbsp; A full serviced lease is required. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.&nbsp; Due to project timelines, new construction is not being&nbsp;considered. &nbsp; <br /><br />The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Buffalo, New York that will be expiring.&nbsp; The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.&nbsp; In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability and timing of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.&nbsp; <br /><br />

<a href="mailto:brendan.a.deluca.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Washington</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Product Manager for Counter Explosive Hazard (PdM-CEH) is seeking a qualified source to provide modifications to the Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS). HMDS is a Counter Explosive Hazard system that provides standoff detection and marking of metallic and low-metallic surface-laid and shallow-buried antitank landmines, unexploded ordnance, trigger mechanisms, and deep buried Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and metallic encased caches in support of Area Access route clearance operations. HMDS is a mission equipment package mounted on the Husky route clearance vehicle that includes a ground penetrating radar (GPR) and deep buried detection (DBD) capability. Note; the HMDS system includes proprietary software packages for which the Government does not have data rights. Modifications sought are for the GPR component of the current design and include the panel exterior cover as indicated below: <br>   <br> -To improve GPR ruggedness, a new cover material is desired that has the following minimum properties:  transparent to ultra wideband radio frequency energy; high strength; impenetrable by rain, moisture, sand, and dust; low cost; able to withstand multiple impacts with the road surface (paved and unpaved roads); doesn't reduce the probability of detection or increase the false alarm rate compared to the current panel; and maintains these properties over the operating temperature extremes of 31.7C to +57.2C (-25F to 135F).  <br>  <br> -Modifications to reduce the adverse effects on automatic sensor height control due to water that is standing or flowing across the GPR panel nose are also desired (may include both hardware and software modifications).  The water management solution must have the following minimum properties:  transparent to ultra wideband radio frequency energy; doesn't compromise the environmental properties of the new panel cover (see item above); doesn't reduce the probability of detection or increase the false alarm rate compared to the current panel; and maintains these properties over the operating temperature extremes of 31.7C to +57.2C (-25F to 135F).  <br>  <br> It is currently estimated that these modifications (delivered and installed hardware) would need to be fully integrated into the existing design by 1 August 2015 to support HMDS system level risk reduction testing.  <br>  <br> Please note this is NOT a Request for Proposal. Offerors shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research. Interested Offerors are requested to submit a White Paper that describes the Offeror's specific technologies and devices which meet the required capabilities described above. Offerors must detail their previous knowledge and experience demonstrating the performance of such modifications to GPR systems comparable to the HMDS GPR system. Offerors that cannot provide sufficient detail on their knowledge and experience with such GPR modifications will not be found capable. Company experience, personnel, existing facilities (R&D and production), and other relevant capabilities should also be identified. The White Paper shall be no more than 15 pages and be prepared in Microsoft Word, Times New Roman font, size 12. <br> Responses should also include a cover letter (not included in the page count) providing: <br>  <br> 1. A point of contact for your Company which will include: the contact's name, address, website (if available), phone number, and email address. In addition, please provide a Cage Code and Duns Number. <br>  <br> 2. Statement as to whether or not your company is considered a small or large business. If your company is a small business, please indicate any socioeconomic classification (8(a), Woman-Owned, Veteran-Owned and Operated, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Operated business, or HUB-Zone) that applies. <br>  <br> 3. Has your Company performed this type of effort or similar type effort (to include size and complexity) in the past, if so provide Contract Number , Point of Contact (POC), e-mail address, phone number, and a brief description of your direct support of the effort? <br>  <br> 4. Is your company currently providing similar products to another government agency or other non-government customer? If so, please identify the agency or non-government customer. If you are unwilling to share your customer's identity, please address whether your company offers the same or similar products commercially (outside the federal Government.) <br>  <br> a. If you elect to identify your past and current customers to which you provided similar products, include the customers/company name and point of contact, phone number and address/e-mail where they can be contacted. <br>  <br> b. If you are a small business and plan to be a prime, please inform how you will meet the limitations on subcontracting Clause 52.219-41. <br>  <br> c. If your company is awarded the contract, will you be able to perform at least 50% (percent) of the work required in house? <br>  <br> The information received in response to this market survey is for informational purposes only.

The determination of acquisition strategy is solely with the government and will be based on this market research and information available to the government from other sources.  <br>  <br> The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237120, Oil and Gas Pipeline and Related Structures Construction, and the related small business size standard is $36.5 Million. The estimated dollar magnitude of this project is between $5 Million and $10 Million dollars.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT FOR QUALIFIED PRIME CONTRACTOR FIRMS ONLY with the intent of awarding a firm fixed price contract.  <br>   <br> PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The Construction Services to be performed under the firm fixed price contract will consists of furnishing labor, plant, materials, and equipment, and performing work necessary to repair and replace existing Fuel Hydrant System and associated Airfield Pavement, Pease ANGB, near Portsmouth  NH. The upcoming transition from KC-135 to KC-46 aircraft will require modifications to the existing aircraft parking plan to accommodate the larger aircraft size. As such, the project will add/alter the existing fuel loop system on the existing parking apron to take the southernmost existing loop out of service and replace it with a new loop that will service the proposed aircraft parking configuration. Further in support of this add/alter project, three new hydrant pits will be installed and several existing hydrant pits and vents will be removed or adjusted. The fueling system will be re-commissioned by the contractor following this work.  The fueling system is a Department of Defense Pressurized Hydrant Fueling System Type III per AW-78-24-28.  The following is a summary of the fuel system work required: <br>  <br> (a)	Replacement of the existing hydrant loop beginning at Isolation Valve Pit (IVP) #4 and serving aircraft parking positions on 3 Row and 4 Row. New loop will consist of a 10 inch stainless steel carrier pipe and a 14 inch carbon steel containment pipe. The total length of new loop is approximately 1890 feet. <br> (b)	The existing portion of the hydrant loop serving 3 Row and 4 Row is 10 inch stainless steel carrier pipe and a 14 inch fiberglass containment pipe. This portion of the hydrant loop will be drained, made vapor free and filled with grout. <br> (c)	Installation of two (2) new hydrant pits on 4 Row and one (1) new hydrant pit on 5 Row. <br> (d)	Installation of low point drain and high point vent pits in the new loop. <br> (e)	Removal of four (4) existing hydrant pits on 3 Row, four (4) existing hydrant pits on 4 Row and two (2) existing hydrant pits on 5 Row. <br> (f)	Removal of two (2) high point vent pits and an Isolation valve pit in the loop being replaced. <br> (g)	Removal of the pits will consist of removing all internal equipment, pit lids and demolishing the entire slab in which they are located. The fiberglass pits will be removed to a point at least one foot below the new replacement pavement section depth. The portion of the pit remaining will be filled with suitable backfill material. All usable parts will be turned over to the Government. <br> (h)	Provide cathodic protection system for carbon steel containment pipe. All new piping will be cathodically protected.  <br> (i)	Provide a system to monitor space between the carrier and containment pipes for leaks in accordance with the requirements of New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules, Section Env-WM 1402.25, Interstitial Leak Monitoring for New AST Systems. This will be done by continuously monitoring liquid accumulation at the low points of the new piping system. <br> (j)	Modify the current Hansa Leak Detection System software to reflect the change in the length of underground piping or replace with a new system. <br> (k)	Install electrical conduit adjacent to the new loop piping to run conductors from low point level switches. <br> (l)	Power for the cathodic protection system will come from one of the buildings near IVP#4. <br>  <br> In addition to these fueling system related changes, the project will repair/replace airfield pavement that is incidental to the replacement/upgrade of the fueling system, as well as repl <br> ace pavement as needed to address the aircraft movement requirements of the new apron parking layout including reconstruction of several fillets around the perimeter of the parking apron, replacing damaged/failing pavement within the apron in approach to the hangar apron connector, widening the hangar apron connector taxiway, and providing new lead-in striping for the maintenance hangars. The following is a summary of the pavement work required: <br>  <br> (a)	Concrete slabs (25'x25'x14 quote mark ) on the parking apron will be removed and replaced to accomplish the work of removing existing hydrant fueling pits and the installation of new pits for the revised aircraft parking layout. Additionally, four taxiways along the apron require fillet widening for the new aircraft main gear to track full strength pavement when turning to enter/exit the apron. Two options are included for the fillet widening, a full depth asphalt pavement section or a concrete pavement section. The northern most infield along Taxiway D will be paved in its entirety. An existing storm drain inlet will be removed. <br> (b)	The taxiway providing access to the aircraft hangars will be relocated just south of the existing taxiway. This will allow for additional maneuverability onto the apron with the larger aircraft and proposed hangar expansion for the two hangars on the north end of the ramp. This alignment will maintain minimum wingtip clearance to the existing hangars on the south end of the ramp. An existing loading dock to the south of the taxiway will be demolished and the turfed area re-graded. Complete removal of the existing taxiway is proposed as an optional line item to this contract. <br>  <br> The volume of Portland cement concrete airfield pavement is on the magnitude of 1,600 cubic yards for the project.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation. This Sources Sought Announcement is for the purpose of identifying small business concerns who are capable and interested in bidding on this dredging project.
<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking sources for a construction project titled, Lower Snake and Clearwater Rivers Navigation Maintenance Dredging. This will be a fixed price construction contract. Place of performance is Franklin, Whitman, Asotin, and Garfield Counties in Washington State and Nez Perce County in Idaho. Construction magnitude is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Performance and payment bonds in the amount of 100% of the contract price will be required. Responses to this announcement are due no later than 25 February 2014 at 5:00pm, Pacific.</p>
<p>The work consists of mechanical dredging of the federal navigation channel, port berthing areas, and a navigation lock approach at four locations on the Snake River and lower Clearwater River. One site is the downstream navigation lock approach for Ice Harbor Dam Snake River Mile (RM) 9.5, while the other three sites are located at the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater rivers in Lower Granite reservoir. The three sites in Lower Granite are the Federal channel (Snake RM 138 to Clearwater RM 2) and the berthing areas for the Port of Lewiston (Clearwater RM 1-1.5) and Port of Clarkston (Snake RM 137.9 and 139). The dredging quantities are approximately 2,337 cubic yards at Ice Harbor Dam (Snake RM 9.5), 458,472 cubic yards at Federal channel (Snake RM 138 to Clearwater RM 2), 14,143 cubic yards at Port of Clarkston (Snake RM 137.9 and 139), and 4,664 cubic yards at Port of Lewiston (Clearwater RM 1-1.5). The Corps identified a location in the Lower Granite reservoir (Snake RM 116) just upstream of Knoxway Canyon, as the in-water disposal site of the dredged materials. Disposal will include selective placement of material to construct a near-shore underwater bench and shape to create fish habitat. Disposal would form a uniform, gently sloping shallow-water bench along about 2,500 linear feet of shoreline. The top width of the dredging disposal section would be approximately 200 linear feet and generally would have a 2%-5% slope from the shoreline sloping out to the side slope catch point. The side slope of the dredging disposal section generally would be 1V on 10H (1 foot vertical on 10 feet linear). The water depth along the shoreline after placement of the dredged material would be 6-8 feet. The current water depths at the disposal site, RM 116, range from 20-30 feet. The work will also include before (pre), progress and after (post) hydrographic surveys, for the dredge and disposal areas for topographic control and quantity calculations, and water quality monitoring. Total volume of dredged material for all four locations is approximately 400,000 to 500,000 cubic yards.</p>
<p>The onsite performance period is Dec 15, 2014 - Feb 14, 2015.</p>
<p>In the sources sought response, interested contractors MUST submit the following: 1) Describe your approach to successfully complete the dredging quantities within the onsite performance period considering the distance between the dredging locations described above and the disposal location RM116. 2) In the last dredging action in 2005-2006 turbidity limits were exceeded during the re-handling along the shoreline, momentarily stopping the placement several times and delaying completion of the dredged material placement. For the present acquisition, re-handling of the dredged material is required to place the material along the shoreline at RM 116 to achieve the desired contours. Generally describe your re-handling process at RM 116 and preventive actions to limit turbidity exceedances. 3) Describe the topographic and hydrographic surveying methods and procedures, positioning and depth finding means, you intend to use to monitor dredge performance, progress, and pay requests, and to provide quality control of completed dredged sections. 4) Describe your past experience using "real time" water quality monitoring, data acquisition systems that use satellite/cell phone telemetry, database development, and web-based data displays. 5) Submit your past performance history of work similar to the work described in the sources sought above. <br /><br />The Contractor will be required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at http://publications.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/EM_385-1-1_languages/EM_385-1-1_English_2008/toc.html</p>
<p>This sources-sought announcement is issued for the purpose of identifying small business concerns, including HUBZone small business firms, woman-owned small business firms, small disadvantaged business firms, veteran-owned small business firms, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms, with the capability to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>Information from firms who respond to this announcement by submitting a statement addressing the five technical areas identified above will be used in the Government's determination of whether to set aside this requirement for small business or open it to unrestricted competition. Include your firm's DUNS number, bonding capacity, and a statement indicating your small business type (small business, HUBZone, woman-owned, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned, or service-disabled veteran-owned.) The NAICS Code for this project is 237990. The small business size standard for Dredging is no more than $25,500,000 in average annual receipts AND the firm must perform at least 40 percent of the volume dredged with its own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern. Please email your response to: Phyllis.L.Buerstatte@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>All responses to this notice must be received on or before 5:00pm, Pacific time, on 25 February 2014.</p>

<CONTACT>Jerry B. Smith, Contracting Officer, Phone 719338267, Email jerry.smith.25@us.af.mil
<DESC>The 10CONS/LGCB, Operational Contracting Office, USAF Academy, US Air Force Academy received a Sole Source justification for the purchase of an Automated Flash Chromatography to Yamazen Science, Inc., 903 Sneath Ln, Suite 125, San Bruno, CA 94066. This procurement is for the acquisition of a sole source commercial item using simplified procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) number is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, and the business size standard is 500.<br /><br />a. Only one responsible source and no other item will satisfy the USAFA requirement.</p>
<p>b. Yamazen is the manufacture and only approved source for the Model Wprep-W10Vflash Chromatography system. <br /><br />c. This request is issued for the USAF Academy Dean of Faculty. Yamazen is the only known source that meets the USAFA requirements.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT submit a bid/quote at this time.<br />Requirement:</p>
<p>The Chemistry Department (DFC) has a requirement for an automated flash chromatography system for use in support of faculty, staff, and cadet research projects involving a wide variety of chemistries. For this reason, a versatile system capable of simultaneous (parallel) dual channel separations, easy PC-aided method development based on TLC (thin layer chromatography) separations, UV detection with a large absorbance scale (&gt; 3000mAu) for high sample loading, and the option for ELSD or RI detector add-ons, is needed.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the salient characteristics required: An integrated TLC reader by which a separation method is automatically determined via the included software for optimal separation. Parallel dual channel capabilities which allow for simultaneous analyses using the same, or if needed, two different separation configurations (e.g. normal phase on one channel and reversed-phase configuration on the other). A stand-alone PC for instrument control and processing of the data instead of a built-in display and dedicated software. The stand-alone PC must also have the capacity to be used just as any other PC with USAFA-loaded software with networking capabilities to accomplish other tasks. An open modular system that allows for easy access during routine user maintenance and minor repair, allowing for shipping of the individual components to the vendor for factory repair instead of in-house service repair.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they can provide a Flash Chromatography with all of the features and functions of the requirement described above may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim they can provide this brand name or equal. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement can be conducted. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received NLT 12:00 pm Mountain Standard Time (MST) on 29 January 2015. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement. Contractors must have a current registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) at http://sam.gov/.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract processed IAW FAR 12 and 13. The closing date of this synopsis is 12:00 pm, Mountain Standard Time (MST) on 28 January 2015.</p>

<DESC>FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, THIS IS A REQUEST FOR SUBMISSION OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING DRAFT SOLICITATION. THIS REQUEST IS NOT A FINAL SOLICITATION. PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL.
<p>1. This pre-solicitation notice is being posted for the purpose of obtaining industry feedback concerning the attached DRAFT Solicitation. Response to the request for questions is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit an offer if, or when, a Final Solicitation is released. However, we highly encourage you to reply. The request is for final planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. There is no entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges that arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this notice. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>2. This requirement is to provide a full range of responsive environmental remediation actions necessary to protect human health &amp; the environment. It includes rapid response and removal of environmental media contaminations and site restoration activities located on Base Realignment and Closure Bases (BRAC) in EPA regions 9 &amp; 10 (Western). The BRAC Environmental Construction and Services Requirements Contract (BECSRC) is being contemplated to include a 5 year ordering period with 24 additional months for performance completion of services.</p>
<p>3. The purpose of soliciting and awarding this Requirements Contract is to have a tool in place for "pop-up" interim Environmental Remediation requirements. "Pop-ups" are unplanned, out-of-cycle requirements that occur periodically, but erratically on installations included in the BRAC Program Management Division portfolio. The BRAC Program Management Division, responsible for remediation and transfer of Air Force property affected by BRAC legislation, manages the disposal of Air Force property in accordance with BRAC law and the BRAC Master Plan to achieve early environmental resolution and early property disposal to return value to the Air Force and local communities. Requirements contracts are set up with one contractor to provide service (FAR 16.503). Generally speaking, an IDIQ obligates the Government to a minimum quantity/dollar amount at the time award, while a Requirements Contract guarantees the contractor no such minimum. <br /><br />4. The contracting officer will conduct this source selection using a phased evaluation process which is sometimes referred to as a "down-select." To make the process more efficient, the contracting officer is limiting the amount of information that offerors must submit initially. The contracting officer shall notify offerors promptly in writing when their proposals are excluded from the competitive range or otherwise eliminated from the competition after which Evaluation Notices (ENs) will be sent to offerors within the competitive range as needed. Those offerors considered by the Contracting Officer to be within the competitive range will be asked to submit the Volume III (Pricing) and Volume IV (Sample Task Order) in Phase II of this source selection.<br /><br />5. All questions/comments pertaining to the DRAFT RFP shall be provided to the Government for consideration in the provided matrix Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet has a field for Section/Attachment Number, Applicable Region, Page # / Paragraph Reference and Question/Comment. Please ensure that both sheets and fields are completed in their entirety. <br /><br />The Government is specifically requesting industry input on the adequacy and feasibility of the BECSRC Western Pricing Matrix which includes tabs for Deliverables, Unit Pricing, and Labor Rates.</p>
<p>6. Request for Questions: The Government anticipates a final solicitation to be released 12 Feb 2015; however, this is subject to change depending on the amount of questions we receive.

<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Diversity. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br>  <br> (1) Factor 1, Technical.  The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:  <br>  <br> (i) Subfactor 1, Provider Capability.   This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence the Offeror is a telecommunications company that owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, and provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort. <br>  <br> (ii)  Subfactor 2, Local Communications Services.  This subfactor is met when the Offeror demonstrates their ability to provide local exchange services to the Government installation as required by the Statement of Work, and provides a site specific diagram of the network connectivity to the Government installation that illustrates the Offeror's ability provide the services in the Statement of Work.  <br>  <br> (2)  Factor 2, Price.   The total evaluated price of all CLINs for the base year and all option years on the Pricing Schedule will be evaluated. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to conduct a price realism analysis for the purpose of measuring the Offeror's understanding of the contract requirements. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br>  <br> (3)   Factor 3, Past Performance.  The government will employ several approaches including reviewing contract references provided by the Offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: Acceptable - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the Offeror's performance record is unknown. Unacceptable - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can reasonably be assigned shall be determined to have unknown past performance and considered  quote mark acceptable quote mark .  <br>  <br> End of 52.212-2 Addendum  <br>  <br> (x) Offerors are encouraged to complete all Representations and Certifications electronically at the System for Award Management website located at URL https://sam.gov/ .

Most training participants will arrive on Tuesday, March 17, 2015 but some training participants will arrive March 16, 2015 because they are traveling from more distant locations. <br /><br />Requirements<br />Lodging accommodations for approximately 75-80 individuals which shall require at a minimum:<br />(A) Providing approximately 55 sleeping rooms for a three-day period beginning on Tuesday, March 17, 2015 and ending on Friday, March 20, 2015 and providing approximately 25 sleeping rooms for a four-day period beginning on Monday, March 16, 2015 and ending on Friday, March 20, 2015. All rooms will be provided at or below the government per diem rate. If necessary, due to availability lodging may be provided at different locations. The hotel must be located in Downtown Washington, DC, in a safe area, preferably within a ten to fifteen minute walk of NLRB's Headquarters located at 1099 14th St. NW as well as within walking distance of a variety of restaurants. <br />(B) Sleeping rooms should be clean, well furnished and include usual amenities for overnight accommodations. All rooms must include free high-speed internet access (WIFI preferred). It is also preferred that the rooms contain a refrigerator. At a minimum easy access to a refrigerator must be provided. In addition, the hotel must include complimentary on-premises exercise facility with state of the art equipment such as elliptical trainers, treadmills, bikes and other strength training equipment that are properly maintained and in good working condition.</p>
<p>Basis for Award<br />The NLRB intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The objective of the NLRB is to select the proposal that represents the best value to the government while meeting or exceeding the requirements. All evaluation factors and their relative importance are set forth in this RFP. A site visit of the facility may be conducted prior to award. The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance. An integrated assessment of proposals using all evaluation factors found in the solicitation will be the basis for award. The award may be made based on the initial submission, with or without discussion, so contractors should submit proposals that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the NLRB.</p>
<p>All offerors must confirm in their proposal that the facility is compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire and Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) and the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (Public Law 101-336)(42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.).</p>
<p>The NLRB is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales taxes in proposals for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. A contractor can contact SAMs by email at http://www.sam.gov. A DUNS (Dun and Bradstreet) number is required in order to register.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria<br />Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government on the basis of technical, past performance, and price. These factors are listed in order of importance:</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical<br />a. Location - Proposals will be evaluated on the ability of the hotel to provide a facility that is located in Downtown Washington, DC, in a safe area, within a ten to fifteen minute walk of NLRB's Headquarters located at 1099 14th St. NW as well as within walking distance of a variety of restaurants.<br />b. Rooms - Sleeping rooms should be clean, furnished appropriately and include the usual amenities for overnight accommodations. Sleeping rooms should also have complimentary high speed internet access (wifi preferred) and a refrigerator or easy access to a refrigerator.<br />c. Other Considerations - Transportation to major airports, availability and cost of on-site guest parking. In addition, the hotel must include complimentary on-premises exercise facility with state of the art equipment such as elliptical trainers, treadmills, bikes and other strength training equipment that are properly maintained and in good working condition.</p>
<p>Factor II - Past Performance<br />1. Quality of product/service<br />2. Responsiveness of key personnel and staff<br />3. Overall Satisfaction</p>
<p><br />**Past Performance will be assessed by utilizing the attached questionnaire. The Offeror is requested to provide at least three references or may have the references complete the questionnaire and submit to the Contracting Officer on or before the proposal due date. The reference information should be project/action specific. The reference information cannot be more than five years old. The NLRB may also assess Past Performance in any other manner prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.</p>
<p>Factor III - Price<br />The NLRB intends to award a firm-fixed price contract. Lodging price must be at the Government per diem rate of $ 229 per night or lower.</p>
<p>Proposal must be valid 90 days after submission.</p>
<p>All non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price; however, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the proposed price may become the determining factor for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate Proposals and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government. <br />In case of a receipt of a large number of Proposals, the evaluation team will evaluate Proposals in phases in order to progressively reduce the number of Proposals being considered for contract award. <br />First, technical Proposals will be evaluated using streamlined methods to eliminate those Proposals that are unacceptable in not meeting the aforementioned criteria. <br />The decision to eliminate any offers does not constitute the establishment of a competitive range, and will not obligate the NLRB to conduct discussions or to solicit Proposal revisions.</p>
<p>Proposal Submission<br />Proposals are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner, making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Proposals should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this Solicitation. Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English. Proposals that do not follow this format or otherwise include documentation that is difficult to read, may be rejected or may result in a lower evaluation rating.</p>
<p>If a hotel contract is necessary, it shall be submitted with your technical and price proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, diagrams, and amenities.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall submit three separate volumes: Volume 1: Technical; Volume II: Past Performance; and Volume III: Price that address the RFP. Proposals are due by 4:00 p.m. EST on February 9, 2015 via email to Delfina St Clair at Delfina.St.Clair@nlrb.gov or by regular mail. Proposals should be submitted in either Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word 2007. Proposals may be shipped or mailed to the following address:</p>
<p>National Labor Relations Board<br />Acquisitions Management Branch<br />1099 14th Street, NW, Room 5006<br />Washington, DC 20570<br />Attention: Delfina St Clair</p>
<p>The NLRB Contracting Officer will serve as point of contact (POC) for inquiries and clarifications.</p>
<p>To the extent prospective Offerors have questions or comments regarding this Solicitation, they are to be submitted in writing via email to the Contract Office at Delfina.St.Clair@nlrb.gov by 12:00 noon EST on February 2, 2015. At the NLRB's discretion, the NLRB may provide written responses to the questions or comments as appropriate. Any such responses will be posted as an Amendment to the Solicitation.</p>

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.<br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).<br />[_] TIN:_____________________.<br />[_] TIN has been applied for.<br />[_] TIN is not required because:<br />[_] Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States;<br />[_] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government;<br />[_] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;<br />(4) Type of organization.<br />[_] Sole proprietorship;<br />[_] Partnership;<br />[_] Corporate entity (not tax-exempt);<br />[_] Corporate entity (tax-exempt);<br />[_] Government entity (Federal, State, or local);<br />[_] Foreign government;<br />[_] International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4;<br />[_] Other ____________________.<br />(5) Common parent.<br />[_] Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent:<br />[_] Name and TIN of common parent:<br />Name ____________________________________<br />TIN ______________________________________<br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA <br /><br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment.

Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product 	Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ 	___________________ <br />___________________ 	___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

Feeding Tube Real Time Tip Tracking System
Brand name or equal.  Meet or exceed.

A. Background:

The Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) has a requirement to replace the current feeding tube real time tip tracking system. Due to advances in technology the current operational system is being upgraded by the industry and the disposable supplies and older equipment will no longer be available. The upgraded operational system must afford SAVAHCS the ability to provide a safer placement, with real-time bedside confirmation of correct placement and reduced patient exposure to X-ray and potential infection if transported to X-ray. 

B. Requirements:

The Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) requires the following: 
"	An electromagnetic transmitting stylet and feeding tube real time tip tracking system that generates a real-time signal as the feeding tube is inserted and advanced to the desired placement.
"	A Smart Receiver Unit (SRU) that receives the signal from the transmitting stylet as it is tracked through the placement procedure.
"	All -in-one monitor with integrated visual display terminal (VDT) that is touch screen and embedded computing system. The all-in-one monitor triangulates the signal from the SRU and displays a real-time representation of the feeding tubes tip's passage as it proceeds down the esophagus and into the preferred placement position.
"	Disposable Enteral Access System Electromagnetic Transmitting Stylet and Ultra-Lite Feeding Tube.
C. Performance Monitoring:

The government shall evaluate and monitor the contractor's performance under this contract in accordance with the Performance Metrics (PM) listed below in attachment 1. The PM is primarily focused on what the Government must do to ensure that the contractor has performed in accordance with the performance standards.  It defines how the performance standards will be applied, the method of surveillance, and the minimum acceptable performance threshold(s).

D. Contract Administration Data:

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes or modify any of the requirements under this contract. Only the Contracting Officer is authorized to make commitments or issue changes that will affect price, quantity or quality of performance of this contract.  The Contractor shall:
"	Communicate with the Contracting Officer on all matters pertaining to contract administration via email or phone.
"	Direct all questions and problems regarding this contract in writing to the Contracting Officer.
"	The contractor shall submit timely and correct invoices.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer:<br />(i) Hourly rate.<br />(A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis.<br />(B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.

(If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert &lsquo;None'."]<br />(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.<br />(3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.<br />(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer):<br />(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice met the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract.<br />(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment-<br />(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic);<br />(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures;<br />(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and<br />(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices.<br />(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost-<br />(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and<br />(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices.<br />(5) Overpayments/Underpayments.

The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall-<br />(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-<br />(A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);<br />(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;<br />(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and<br />(D) Contractor point of contact.<br />(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.<br />(6) (i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in 41 U.S.C. 7109, which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.<br />(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.<br />(iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if-<br />(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner;<br />(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or<br />(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.60702).<br />(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.<br />(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:<br />(A) The date fixed under this contract.<br />(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.<br />(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on-<br />(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor;<br />(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or<br />C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.<br />(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.<br />(viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.<br />(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions.<br />(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.<br />(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.<br />(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.<br />(8) Prompt payment.

In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.<br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i) Payments of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours expended in furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

VII.	If the veteran does not already have a standing relationship with a contractor or non-contract vendor or has not seen one within the last year, he or she will be provided a Contractor/Vendor Selection List.

IX.	Any concerns about the clinic process or an attendee's conduct should be discussed outside of the VA Clinic setting, unless it is so egregious that immediate action is needed by the Prosthetics Representative/VA Orthotist/Lab Manager/ COR/designee. In any event, the Contracting Officer should be immediate notified of the issues for appropriate action.
X.	As determined by the Contracting Officer - in association with the COR/ Prosthetics Representative/VA Orthotist/designee, any such action by contractors and non-contract vendors that is deemed inappropriate may result in exclusion from clinic attendance for a period of time or indefinitely. If any VA staff person or veteran is aware of this behavior, it is to be reported to the facility Prosthetics Representative/VA Orthotist/Lab Manager/COR/designee and to the Contracting Officer.
XI.	No patient lists may be distributed to a non-contract vendor attending with his/her patient prior to or during the clinic. Additionally, a sign-in sheet where any non-VA staff person would be able to view the names of veterans being treated is also prohibited. Both lists are assumed to be a violation of various patient privacy laws. No patient information will be allowed to leave the clinic setting unless it's required by the treating contractor or non-contract vendor or VA attendee and only then will the least amount of veteran information be provided to allow adequate treatment of the veteran.
XII.	Per VHA Prosthetics Handbook, a non-contracted Orthotist vendor may be chosen by a veteran only when he/she is seeking continuity of care.

Physical understanding of the dependence of seismic source generation on explosion emplacement conditions (depth, scaled depth, decoupling, material properties, pre-stress, and local structure) is of particular interest, especially for small seismic events. Hypothesis tests of proposed mechanisms for anomalous waveform characteristics, e.g. larger surface waves than predicted for explosions, are of interest. Investigations intended to distinguish between feasible source mechanisms are strongly preferred over efforts to assess the feasibility of a single mechanism. Methods of determining depth to within 10s of meters for shallow events are of particular interest. Partitioning of energy into P, S, and surface waves, and understanding of the higher frequencies that may be critical for local discrimination are of interest, as are methods that can discriminate chemical from nuclear explosions. Proposals may include one or multiple approaches, including analysis of existing nuclear and chemical explosion records, theoretical investigations, and/or numerical simulations.</span></p>

New understanding of the properties of small seismic events and their seismic waveforms at local (200 km or less) and regional (2,000 km or less) distances is of interest, as are extensions of existing regional discriminants to smaller, locally recorded events, and development of new discriminants that take advantage of the characteristics of small locally recorded events, with rigorous assessments of performance and uncertainty. Of particular interest are methods for estimating yield of seismic events recorded at local distances with low uncertainty. At regional distances, there is an interest in improved event characterization of smaller events as well as improved understanding of uncertainties. Methods to improve the accuracy of source characterization by moment tensors and their uncertainties, and new understanding of their limitations, are also of interest.</span></p>

Priority will be given to P-wave velocity structure studies and studies of poorly calibrated regions within Eurasia. Of particular interest are: (1) new techniques of determining 3-D, spatially variable velocity models; (2) new techniques for building models by fitting multiple datasets, especially of different types of data, if the potential to improve predictions that affect location can be shown; (3) techniques to estimate the uncertainty in geophysical models and assess the tradeoffs between different parameters of the models, as well as the uncertainty (confidence, resolution, and variance) in predicted observables, such as travel times; (4) new techniques for determining velocity structure in aseismic regions; and (5) studies that compare different methods to show their strengths and weaknesses; and models that can predict structural effects on seismic amplitudes at 1 Hz and higher as well as travel times. Proposals that utilize full waveforms and finite-frequency methods are of interest. Techniques for accurately predicting P-wave travel times from surface wave based models are of interest.</span></p>

Studies that generate new discrimination calibration events, along with source geometry and other characterizing information are also sought. Accurate estimates of depth and origin time and their uncertainties are important elements of location calibration events. Improved techniques for event location using models and/or ground truth at local, regional or near-teleseismic distances, particularly methods that use more than a single type of data jointly are of interest.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. (2) (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and?

(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

(b) The Contractor shall comply with the FAR clauses in this paragraph (b) that the Contracting Officer has indicated as being incorporated in this contract by reference to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (Contracting Officer check as appropriate.) <BR> <BR>[] (1) 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government (SEP 2006), with Alternate I (OCT 1995) (41 U.S.C. 4704 and 10 U.S.C. 2402).

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Mandatory Electronic Invoicing

The rule became effective December 27, 2012.  The rule includes a new contract clause to be inserted in all solicitations and contracts by the contracting officer (VAAR 852.232-72).  Vendors can comply with the rule by using either of the two methods below:
1.        The FSC uses a third-party contractor, OB10, to transition vendors from paper to electronic invoice submission.  For information on OB10 electronic invoicing set-up, vendors should call 877-752-0900, or email USClientServices@ob10.com .
2.        A system that conforms to the X12 electronic data interchange (EDI) format established by the Accredited Standards Center.  For FSC e-Invoicing information, please call 877-353-9791 or email vafsccshd@va.gov.
FSC and VA's Office of Acquisition, Logistics and Construction (OALC) will assist existing commercial vendors in migrating to the electronic process.  Until the transition to electronic format is complete, FSC will continue to process paper invoices for commercial vendors. 
The FSC's electronic invoicing system provides a variety of flexible solutions for all vendor types, including small businesses, and does not require any vendor transaction fees.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><strong>26 Jan 2015: <br /><br />Amendment to Solicitation. <br /><br /></strong>The PWS has been revised; please see AMDT 01 and Revised PWS.<br /><br /><strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /></strong><strong>15 Jan 2015:<br /><br />SOLICITATION NOTICE:</strong> <strong>This is an RFP, which will result in a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract award.&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>Please see the solictation package and information provided in the presolicitation notice posted on 22 Dec 2014. <br /><br /><strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />22 Dec 2014:<br /><br />PRESOLICITATION NOTICE:</strong> <strong>This is not a solicitation but rather a Presolicitation Synopsis as required by FAR 5.2.</strong>
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to inform the market that the Air Force intends to solicit Thales Visionix, Inc. on a sole-source basis to negotiate an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the procurement of Repair and Replacement of the Scorpion <sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) Equipment to support the A-10 aircraft HMCS program. The proposed NAICS Code is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, which has a corresponding size standard of 750 employees.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>Based on FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The proposed contract action is one for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. If your firm does not agree with this determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing the above services for evaluation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This request is to receive support from Thales Visionix, Inc. March 2015 until March 2017.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The A-10 aircraft users have integrated the Thales Visionix, Inc. (TVI) Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) Equipment into war fighting capabilities. The HMCS components were developed solely by TVI and due to the proprietary nature of this specialized technology it is not commercially available, which makes TVI the only firm capable of meeting the technical requirement to diagnose, repair and replace the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> HMCS equipment..</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong></p>
<p>This effort is to procure Repair and Replacement of the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) Equipment for the A-10 aircraft HMCS program. The Contractor will have to develop and perform testing and evaluation in order to diagnose, repair and/or replace various parts of the HMCS equipment. The contractor will also need to provide various reports and records to help improve program sustainability,&nbsp;knowledge, and capability. Due to the proprietary nature of this requirement, the Contractor must have applied knowledge of the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) Equipment</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal (RFP) or an invitation for bid, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this synopsis.</p>

<p>The formal Request for Proposal (RFP)&nbsp;for CFT has been posted to FBO. There are 21 attachments to the RFP.</p>
<p>Some of the content contained within the RFP (and its attachments) is different than what was provided during the Q&amp;A process. All documents have been updated and/or revised since the Q&amp;A phase. Offerors are suggested to consider the Q&amp;A as a guide only; the formal RFP (and its attachments) supersedes all previous postings. Offerors need to carefully review the RFP (and its attachments) for the applicable due dates and&nbsp;instructions for submitting proposals.<br />__________________________________________________________</p>
<span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Previously Posted Information<br /><br /></span></strong></span></span>
<p>9 Oct 14 - FORMAL SYNOPSIS - Contract Field Teams (CFT)<span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong></span></span><br />This announcement constitutes a Formal Synopsis for the Contract Field Teams (CFT) program located at Tinker AFB.</p>
<p>The Government seeks to award approximately 13 Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts in two (2) competition pools:</p>
<p>(1) Full and Open competition pool: Approximately six (6) ID/IQ contracts to either Small or Large Businesses competing in the Full and Open competition pool whose offers represent the best value to the Government. <br />(2) Small Business Set-Aside competition pool: Approximately seven (7) ID/IQ contracts to Small Businesses competing in the Small Business Set-Aside competition pool whose offers represent the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Note: Offerors competing in the Small Business Set-Aside competition pool may elect to compete in the Full and Open competition pool. Small Businesses will be evaluated in the appropriate competition pool(s) based on the offeror's selection located on the front page of the formal RFP (when released).</p>
<p>The Air Force will acquire this requirement through an Air Force Source Selection.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the resultant contracts will be FAR Part 15 ID/IQ contracts with Firm Fixed Price, Time &amp; Material, and Cost-Reimbursable line items. This is a non-commercial acquisition.</p>
<p>The contract ordering period will consist of a maximum seven years and six months. The basic period will be three-years (ends year 3), Option I will be two-years (ends year 5), and Option II will be two-years (ends year 7). The options will be priced at the time of contract award. At the end of any contract period, FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, allows for continued services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. This clause will be incorporated and evaluated at the time of basic contract award. The solicitation and contract will expressly state that the clause at 52.217-8 may be used for additional ordering period (up to six months) at the end of any contract period and that the NTE rates specified in the contract for the ordering period existing at the time 52.217-8 is exercised will apply to the task orders issued during the new ordering period under the Option to Extend Services. Each task order will state a period of performance for the services ordered and may include clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, so long as it is incorporated and evaluated at the time the task order is issued.</p>
<p>This is a partial Small Business Set-Aside under NAICS Code 336411.</p>
<p>The Line Item Description will be as follows:<br />X001 - Firm Fixed Price (FFP) <br />X002 - Overtime in support of FFP (FP) <br />X003 - Surge (FP) <br />X004 - Over and Above (FFP)<br />X005 - CAP/CAS (CR)<br />X006 - Time and Materials (T&amp;M)<br />X007 - Overtime in support of T&amp;M (T&amp;M)<br />X008 - Material/Non-Material (T&amp;M)<br />X009 - Travel (CR)<br />X010 - Transition In (FFP)<br />X011 - Transition Out (FFP)<br />X012 - Data (NSP)<br />X013 - Post Award Conference (CR)</p>
<p>Deliveries and locations will be cited on individual task orders. FOB Origin and Destination.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to establish a competitive, performance based service acquisition (PBSA) for Contract Field Team (CFT) support. CFTs are available for use by all the Department of Defense (DoD) services and other federal agencies. A CFT is an awarded set of Contractor maintenance personnel who are provided with Government-furnished special tools, equipment, work space and supplies to accomplish modification/maintenance/repair effort on-site at operational Government locations, both in the Continental United States (CONUS) and outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). The CFT program accomplishes depot, field and organizational level inspection, maintenance, modification and repair at operational Government locations worldwide. The program supports requirements for the active Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve components. CFT contracts are also used to support requirements generated by the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies. The CFT program provides a rapid deployment workforce augmentation capability to field necessary skilled technicians on site anywhere in the world to support the Government's war readiness needs.</p>
<p>All award eligibility requirements will be stated in the RFP.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation through FedBizOps at http://www.fbo.gov. Solicitation requests can be submitted to Wade Ward via email at bradley.ward.3@us.af.mil and Melony Adamski at melony.adamski.1@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at 405-736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br />___________________________________________________________<br /><br />Previously Posted Information<br /><br /></span></strong>2 Jul 14 - Follow-up Q&amp;A<br /><br />Attached is the follow-up Q&amp;A derived from the original Q&amp;A posted on 29 May 14.

<p><strong><span>INTRODUCTION <br /></span></strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the federal Mobile Technology Tiger Team (MTTT), a working group level organization within the Information Security and Identity Management Committee (ISIMC) of the Federal CIO Council, the Enterprise Mobility Program within the General Services Administration Office of Integrated Technology Services (ITS) is seeking comments and information related to the commercial factors, capabilities, and considerations for extending the Mobile Security Baseline to cover State, Local Tribal and Territorial (SSLT) entities in an information share scenarios.. This endeavor compliments, but does not duplicate, the efforts being undertaken by FirstNet (the First Responders Network Authority).</p>
<p>The basis for this Request for Information (RFI) is the attached document, a draft version entitled "State, Local Tribal and Territorial Mobile Access to Federal Information Systems: Barriers, Opportunities, and Gaps Analysis." This document is a preparatory step toward publication of a Mobile and Wireless Security Baseline for SLTT entities that will share information on Federal systems.</p>
<p>The analysis of requirements for an SLTT Mobile Security Baseline was conducted during a time of technology transformation in which firms started providing solutions in response to the Federal CIO Council's Government Mobile and Wireless Security Baseline published in May 2013. SLTT entities share sensitive information with Federal Departments and Agencies for activities such as:</p>
<p>&bull; Law Enforcement<br />&bull; The National Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative<br />&bull; The National Strategy for Information Sharing<br />&bull; Emergency Management and Disaster Recovery<br />&bull; Infectious Disease Control<br />&bull; State and local Fusion Centers</p>
<p><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>This RFI is intended to afford potential vendors an opportunity to comment, identify their technical capabilities, and provide policy considerations and recommendations. The Government is requesting firms provide their technical capabilities, experience, and recommendations as to how companies approach securing and coordinating mobile communications whereby transactional information may be shared between the Federal Government and SLTT entities. The government is also soliciting recommendations as to what to consider from a practical and policy perspective when extending the Mobile Security Baseline to include SLTT entities.</p>
<p>Based on this brief description, as well as the attached draft of "Barriers, Opportunities, and Gaps Analysis" document, the Government is requesting information on how firms go about designing, deploying and operating systems that produce the desired outcome. We are also requesting firms identify considerations, constraints, and recommendations (including Industry best practices) the government should include in developing the policy of extending the Mobile Security Baseline to SLTT entities.</p>
<p>This requirement is in its initial/planning stage and the requested information will afford the MTTT better understand your industry's delivery capabilities and how they will impact the development of security policy in a way that enables continued FirstNet adoption.</p>
<p>This Request for Information does not in any way imply a planned or pending procurement action by the United States Government. Responses to this RFI can not constitute an offer and shall not be accepted as the basis for forming a binding contract. The Government is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this RFI. The government will not reimburse any respondent for any costs associated with information submitted in response to this RFI.</p>

<p>NFIP was created by an act of Congress in 1968, and is the largest mono-line insurance operation in the Nation. FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) operates a marketing and advertising program, called FloodSmart and the associated FloodSmart.gov websites to increase awareness of flood risk and to encourage homeowners, renters, condominium owners and business owners to purchase federally-backed flood insurance. The mission of the Risk Insurance Division (RID) is to provide flood insurance to help citizens and their communities effectively recover from flooding events. The vision of RID is a nation where everyone who needs flood insurance has it. This is accomplished through three primary strategic goals:</p>
<p>&bull; Achieve Operational Excellence<br />&bull; Deliver Flood Insurance to the Public<br />&bull; Implement program changes and reforms as directed by Congress</p>
<p><br />The current FloodSmart program consists of ongoing strategic areas of services managed by FIMA's Risk Insurance Division and operated through a multi-year contract. Additionally, independent insurance agents provide write your own (WYO) services where the agents write NFIP policies and the government financially backs the policies. The marketing services are intended to supplement Federal, state, and local government and private sector implementation of Federal statutes and regulations designed to require the purchase of flood insurance in certain circumstances. Varied marketing communications activities are needed to improve understanding of the NFIP, the benefits of flood insurance, and to stimulate interest in and prompt consumer decision-making leading to new purchase and retention of sufficient amounts of flood insurance coverage. Varied marketing communications activities are needed to improve understanding of the NFIP, the benefits of flood insurance, and to stimulate interest in and prompt consumer decision-making leading to the purchase and retention of sufficient amounts of flood insurance coverage. The contractor which performs these services will provide strategic marketing direction, establish advertising campaigns, manage multi-million dollar annual media purchases, provide administrative support, direct and manage: website development and maintenance; government representation and various industry conferences directed to flood insurance stakeholders; provide direct mail and call center support; perform analyses/assessments of various campaigns and actions taken; liaise with all parties of interest (i.e., stakeholders); dynamically propose campaigns modifications, including electronic marketing and social media approaches; and provide accounting system support that comply with Cost Accounting Standards, including the rules and regulations, and audit responsibilities in implementing Section 26 of the Federal Procurement Policy Act, Public Law 100-679 (CAS).</p>
<p>Other functions and responsibilities will be required as reflected in the abbreviated Statement of Objectives that follow. It is anticipated that much of the services cited will be performed by subcontractors so the lead Contractor must be skilled in managing other firms; taking the lead; communicating crisply and accurately; overseeing and accepting responsibility for subcontractor performance. The successful proposer will be able to show superior management and direction skills with its subcontractors.</p>
<p>The NFIP requires a contractor that is capable of providing a full-service integrated marketing, advertising and public relations effort for the National Flood Insurance Program. The contractor shall provide all personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, supplies, services, and otherwise do all things necessary for providing the policy growth requirement</p>
<p>The general areas of ongoing strategic performance include:</p>
<p>1. Day-to-day account service and management.

<p>4. Develop annual paid media buys based on funding available. The Program Office allocates funding for these purposes to a SmartLink account. (SmartLink is a payment system operated by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and is used by government agencies for funding on demand.) As background, to disseminate flood insurance information, FloodSmart conducts a robust paid, direct-response advertising program across television, radio, print, online and direct mail mediums. To accomplish this, the program office establishes an allotment in the DHHS SmartLink account funds to support the execution of the paid media plan that is aligned to the annual Communications Plan approved by the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA). The amount of funds placed in the SmartLink account for each contract year is a minimum of $10 million. FIMA from time to time, when additional funds were available, has increased the amount for paid advertising above and beyond $10 million. As funding increases the Contractor will need to be flexible in its management.</p>
<p>5. Provide for national, regional and local advertisements, develop media schedules, purchase broadcast time, print and internet space, and deliver advertisement materials to appropriate media outlets. The Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials, supplies, tools, travel and all things necessary to create, design and deliver television, radio, internet, magazine, newspaper, outdoor/transit, static exhibits and displays, and signage advertising materials in support of all programs.</p>
<p>6. Perform pre and post advertisement analytics to assess campaign effectiveness. The Contractor shall perform research and tracking activities.

The leads system must include the ability to receive leads from the postal system, various web interfaces, and in-bound Call Center communications. Transmission of leads to insurance agents registered to receive and respond is to be done efficiently.</p>
<p><br />9. The Contractor will provide complete Public Relations for NFIP. The Contractor shall coordinate with FEMA External Affairs and execute public relations and media relations activities for flood seasonal outreach, quick response to weather events, and critical NFIP issues. The Contractor also manages all aspects of the NFIP radio or television spot advertisements including public service announcements (PSA's). Activities also include, but are not limited to: video testimonials of flood insurance policyholders, social media tracking, and social media utilization. The contractor may also be called upon to produce additional materials to explain various aspects of the NFIP through a variety of media.</p>
<p>10. The Contractor shall maintain and enhance outreach programs designed to foster positive communications with and through the NFIP's multiple stakeholders.</p>

Firms should be registered well in advance of the closing date for submission of the SF 330 as the process may take 3 - 5 days.  <br>    <br> Q&A 1 <br> Will you hold an interview of the shortlisted firms? <br>  <br>      Once a shortlist has been established, selected firms on that list will be contacted and further instructions will be given as to how to prepare for interview/presentation. <br>  <br> In solicitation W912LM-15-R-0003 under SELECTION CRITERIA, criterion (2) reads  quote mark SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE and technical competence in the type of work described in CONTRACT INFORMATION, DUTIES, including experience... quote mark   Can you please clarify what  quote mark contract information quote mark  and  quote mark duties quote mark  refer to? <br>  <br>      This refers to any DoD experience or any experience that your firm has that is mentioned or listed in paragraph 3 of the pre-solicitation document and then followed in paragraph 4. <br>  <br> Am I reading it correctly that both Part I and Part II count in the 20 double-sided sheet limit? If so, can I ask that the Guard reconsider and make Part II's additional. To meet the needs of the Guard, we want to bring the best subcontractor team possible. This could easily be 8-10 subcontractors and then we would need Part II's for any branch offices. As you can seem, Part II's could easily start to take our 20 double-sided sheet limit.  <br>  <br>      There is a 20 page double sided limit for responses to this Pre-Solicitation Request. That 20 pages includes your SF330's Part I and Part II, Tabs, and a cover should you decide to include it.  <br>  <br> In solicitation W912LM-15-R-0003, does the 20 double-sided sheet page count exclude covers, tabs, table of contents, and SF 330 Part IIs? <br>  <br>      Yes, the 20 page double-sided limit includes all listed. <br>  <br> Do the cover and tabs within each submittal count towards the page limit of 20 double-sided pages? <br>  <br>      Yes, the 20 page double-sided limit includes all listed. <br>  <br> Your Pre-Solicitation Notice referrers to both a hard copy document w/CD submitted and an emailed document submitted. Can you please clarify what is required? <br>  <br>      Interested firms should submit the hard copy document to this office. You may follow up and ensure that items were received by email. <br>

<DESC>January 26, 2015<br />Requisition #: 15-004213<br />Notice of Intent to Sole Source<br />The National Institute of Health Office of Purchasing and Contracts intends to negotiate and award a contract to Promega Corporation to provide PowerPlex 16 HS 400rxn kits for monitoring patients after allogeneic transplant which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 325413, and the size standard is 500 Employees<br />This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive quotations. Interested concerns capable of providing the same or similar products or services as described in this notice may submit a capability statement outlining their capabilities. No solicitation is available. Information received will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability Statements must be received within the time set forth in this synopsis to be considered by the Government. A determination to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC).</p>
<p>The Department of Laboratory Medicine is in need for the Powerplex 16 system offers a diverse range of loci, providing enough different loci to be statistically relevant, it was fully validated and implemented in Allogeneic Transplant Engraftment Monitoring and is integral to several ongoing protocols in NHLBI and NCI.<br />This kit co-amplifies16 different loci to increase the chance of finding informative allelic differences between recipient and donor. The monitoring of engraftment using STR has been done in the Molecular section of the NIH, CC, DLM, Hematology Service since 2001. A change to current protocols would risk laboratory certification by causing the laboratory to be cited as failing to be compliant to laboratory guidelines established by the College of American Pathologists Accreditation Agency.<br />STR (a) (short tandem repeat) loci consist of short, repetitive sequence elements 3 to 7 base pairs in length. These repeats are well distributed throughout the human genome and are a rich source of highly polymorphic markers, which may be detected using the polymerase chain reaction. Alleles of STR loci are differentiated by the number of copies of the repeat sequence contained within the amplified region and are distinguished from one another using radioactive, silver stain or fluorescence detection following electrophoretic separation. <br />The PowerPlex &reg; 16 HS System allows the co-amplification and three-color detection of sixteen loci (fifteen STR loci and Amelogenin), including Penta E, D18S51, D21S11, TH01, D3S1358, FGA, TPOX, D8S1179, vWA, Amelogenin, Penta D, CSFIPO, D16S539, D7S820, D13S317 and D5S818. One primer for each of the Penta E, D18S51, D21S11, TH01 and D3S1358 loci is labeled with fluorescein (FL); one primer for each of the FGA, TPOX, D8s1179, vWA and Amelogenin loci is labeled with carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine (TMR); and one primer for each of the Penta D, CSF1PO, D16S539, D7S820, D13S317 and D5S818 loci is labeled with 6-carboxy-4', 5' dichloro-2', 7'-dimethoxy-fluorescein (JOE). All sixteen loci are amplified simultaneously in a single tube and analyzed in a single injection.<br />The DLM's Hematology Service provides engraftment monitoring (Chimerism testing) in the clinical laboratory for patients who have undergone allogeneic transplant, as a service to several groups within the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).<br />There are other types of kits that are on the market that utilize STR amplification, however, they either don't amply enough different loci or they amplify more than needed. The PowerPlex HS system has been fully validated for use in monitoring patient engraftment. Switching to another system would entail lengthy validations and would alter current results of our protocols.</p>
<p>QTY 18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />CAT# DC2100<br />Description: PowerPlex(R) 16HS 400rxn<br /><br />All responses are due to the Contract Specialist within seven (7) calendar days from the date of this synopsis.</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Air Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Systems Program Office (PMA-264) located in Patuxent River, MD is issuing this Sources Sought as a means of conducting market research to identify potential business sources that:</p>
<p>1) Have the resources, potential production capabilities, and relevant experience to produce a coherent source sonobuoy used in the US Navy ASW Multi-static Active Coherent (MAC) program.</p>
<p>2) Can meet the minimum source levels and Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities required by the ASW MAC coherent source Performance Sonobuoy Specification (PSS).</p>
<p>3) Have performance enhancements (i.e. frequency diversity, High Duty Cycle) that will increase the probability of detection and decrease operator workload.</p>
<p>4) Can provide delivery of prototypes, production representative models and full rate production sonobuoys that will support US Navy Fleet requirements.<br /><br />5) Can ramp up manufacturing to deliver up to 15,000 units per year.</p>
<p>6) May have independent prototypes, technologies, or capabilities for coherent source sonobuoys.</p>
<p>The MAC program is designed to conduct wide area search, clearance, and battle group screening missions for the US Navy Combatant Commanders, and to enable transition of subsurface detections to localization and target prosecutions. The MAC system is composed of three major airborne subsystems: the AN/SSQ-125 source sonobuoy, the AN/SSQ-101 Air Deployable Active Receiver (ADAR) sonobuoy, and the MAC processing software embedded in the P-3C and P-8A aircraft. The source sonobuoy produces high decibel level coherent pulses. Returns from the coherent sound are received by the SSQ-101 and transmitted to the aircraft for echo location processing.</p>
<p>Production sonobuoys are built to performance specifications to ensure compatibility with existing and future ASW systems. Sonobuoys are required to meet general performance requirements such as: reliability, service conditions, electrical, mechanical, acoustic, safety, environmental, product assurance, packaging, marking, and operating requirements. The sonobuoy shall be capable of being launched from any platform capable of launching "A" sized sonobuoys.

<DESC>There is a need to replace an obsolete hydrant fuel system built in 1959 that violates criteria for airfield clearance safety. A modern pressurized hydrant fuel system will be constructed using an existing operating storage tanks and pumphouse to support six new hydrant outlets. A new fuel transfer pipeline from the fuel storage area will replace the existing corroded pipeline. This base supports the 4th Fighter Wing and a reserve air refueling wing (KC-135) as well as numerous transient wide-bodied aircraft needing to be refueled. The hydrant refueling system must be capable of supporting hot pit refueling and transient aircraft refueling.   <br>  The project will consist of roughly 3,000 ln meters of 12 quote mark hydrant loop piping, 6 hydrant pits, high point vent assembly, low point drain pit assembly, leak detection system, miscellaneous piping, testing, utilities, site improvements, airfield paving, controls, purge and abandon existing fuel lines, demolition- pump house, building 6 ea- underground storage tanks, piping, and fill stand

<DESC>This is not a solicitation. This Sources Sought Announcement is for the purpose of identifying small business concerns who are capable and interested in bidding on this dredging project.
<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking sources for a construction project titled, Lower Snake and Clearwater Rivers Navigation Maintenance Dredging. This will be a fixed price construction contract. Place of performance is Franklin, Whitman, Asotin, and Garfield Counties in Washington State and Nez Perce County in Idaho. Construction magnitude is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Performance and payment bonds in the amount of 100% of the contract price will be required. Responses to this announcement are due no later than&nbsp;4 March 2014 at 5:00pm, Pacific.</p>
<p>The work consists of mechanical dredging of the federal navigation channel, port berthing areas, and a navigation lock approach at four locations on the Snake River and lower Clearwater River. One site is the downstream navigation lock approach for Ice Harbor Dam Snake River Mile (RM) 9.5, while the other three sites are located at the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater rivers in Lower Granite reservoir. The three sites in Lower Granite are the Federal channel (Snake RM 138 to Clearwater RM 2) and the berthing areas for the Port of Lewiston (Clearwater RM 1-1.5) and Port of Clarkston (Snake RM 137.9 and 139). The dredging quantities are approximately 2,337 cubic yards at Ice Harbor Dam (Snake RM 9.5), 458,472 cubic yards at Federal channel (Snake RM 138 to Clearwater RM 2), 14,143 cubic yards at Port of Clarkston (Snake RM 137.9 and 139), and 4,664 cubic yards at Port of Lewiston (Clearwater RM 1-1.5). The Corps identified a location in the Lower Granite reservoir (Snake RM 116) just upstream of Knoxway Canyon, as the in-water disposal site of the dredged materials. Disposal will include selective placement of material to construct a near-shore underwater bench and shape to create fish habitat. Disposal would form a uniform, gently sloping shallow-water bench along about 2,500 linear feet of shoreline. The top width of the dredging disposal section would be approximately 200 linear feet and generally would have a 2%-5% slope from the shoreline sloping out to the side slope catch point. The side slope of the dredging disposal section generally would be 1V on 10H (1 foot vertical on 10 feet linear). The water depth along the shoreline after placement of the dredged material would be 6-8 feet. The current water depths at the disposal site, RM 116, range from 20-30 feet. The work will also include before (pre), progress and after (post) hydrographic surveys, for the dredge and disposal areas for topographic control and quantity calculations, and water quality monitoring. Total volume of dredged material for all four locations is approximately 400,000 to 500,000 cubic yards.</p>
<p>The onsite performance period is Dec 15, 2014 - Feb 14, 2015.</p>
<p>In the sources sought response, interested contractors MUST submit the following: 1) Describe your approach to successfully complete the dredging quantities within the onsite performance period considering the distance between the dredging locations described above and the disposal location RM116. 2) In the last dredging action in 2005-2006 turbidity limits were exceeded during the re-handling along the shoreline, momentarily stopping the placement several times and delaying completion of the dredged material placement.

Generally describe your re-handling process at RM 116 and preventive actions to limit turbidity exceedances. 3) Describe the topographic and hydrographic surveying methods and procedures, positioning and depth finding means, you intend to use to monitor dredge performance, progress, and pay requests, and to provide quality control of completed dredged sections. 4) Describe your past experience using "real time" water quality monitoring, data acquisition systems that use satellite/cell phone telemetry, database development, and web-based data displays. 5) Submit your past performance history of work similar to the work described in the sources sought above. <br /><br />The Contractor will be required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at http://publications.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/EM_385-1-1_languages/EM_385-1-1_English_2008/toc.html</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Exercise the Option to Extend Services on contract FA9422-10-F-0001 (Logistics Support and Technical Order Management)
<p><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</strong></p>
<p>Per FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, the Government intends to exercise the Option to Extend Services in contract FA9422-10-F-0001 (Logistics Support and Technical Order Management). Option to Extend Services was included in the contract, but not evaluated at time of award. Therefore, in accordance with 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. A follow-on contract is currently being worked, but will not be accomplished before the current expiration of this contract.</p>
<p>The Option to Extend Services will be for a period not to exceed six (6) months and will be to the incumbent MacAulay-Brown, Inc. (4021 Executive Drive, Dayton OH 45430-1062) to continue to support Air Force Nuclear Weapons Logistics Support and Technical Order Management. The current contractor possesses the required experience, based on supporting operations for the entire duration of the program, to ensure mission success while the follow-on competitive contract (FA9401-15-R-8019) is being worked. It was always our intent to have the option to exercise the Option to Extend Services, if needed. At this time, there are no other contractors who are capable of providing these services without incurring an unacceptable delay to on-going operations.</p>
<p>As stated previously competition is expected for the follow-on effort. The Government will post notices regarding that acquisition to FedBizOpps.</p>

Additionally, it will reinforce the learning of literacy and numeracy skills, currently supported by G-PriEd.&nbsp; <br /><br />The justification for this exception to competition is authorized by AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5), is based on impairment of foreign aid programs, and provides that full and open competition need not be obtained for&nbsp;"an award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or would result in unacceptable delays."
