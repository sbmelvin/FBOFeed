<DESC>The New Mexico Veterans Affairs Health Care System (NMVAHCS), 1501 San Pedro Drive SE, Albuquerque NM 87108, intends to negotiate a sole-source commercial (FAR Part 12) supplies contract with Shionogi Qualicaps Inc. a small business that is located at 6505 Franz Warner Parkway, Whitesett, NC 27377 in accordance with FAR Part 6.302- 1 and FAR Part 35.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-05.  The contract shall provide the VA Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC) with quantity one (1) system:  A Model Liqfilsuper FS Fully Automatic Hard Capsule Filling and Sealing System.  This system is a combination of two Shionogi Qualicap units, the Model F-40 fully automatic capsule filling machine and the Model S-40 fully automatic hard capsule sealing machine.  The following features are also included in the order package:  Sealing Section Spare Parts Kit, Filling Section Spare Parts Kit,  Installation and Training includes five days (40 hours) of labor, Validation Package – Includes Installation and Operational Qualification Documents and Execution of the Documents at CSPCRPCC after Installation and Training that Includes three days (24 hours) of labor.  The New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax will apply to the labor portion of this request and it will be offered at F.O. B. Destination pricing.  The system is capable of filling two-part hard gelatin or HPMC capsules with semi-solid or liquid product, including low viscosity liquids.   Only one operator is required for operating the system during production runs. The use of two bands for sealing assures proper sealing, preventing leaking of product and entry of air into the capsules. The use of colored bands allows for a quick check of a seal being applied, product tampering, and product identification. The purchase of this system is required for conducting an important clinical research drug study.  This system is considered to be a sole source because of the foregoing combination of features, especially the combination of systems to allow for the filling of low viscosity liquids, operation by one operator and the use of bands for sealing.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest to the Contracting Officer no later than 1400 Mountain Standard Time, August 29, 2005. A determination by the Government not to compete the action based on responses is solely within the Government’s discretion. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive proposal.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of NMVAHCS.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, or by facsimile at (505) 248-3206.
