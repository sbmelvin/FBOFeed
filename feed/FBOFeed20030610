<DESC>The Pre-solicitation notice for Solicitation No. 03SP101541 is currently available.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the size standard is $28.5 million. This requirement is set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns.  The estimated price range of the work is $100,000 to $250,000.   The work to be performed under this solicitation consists of designing and installing an appropriate rockfall protection system to provide adequate protection of people and property.    The project is located on the Yakima River, approximately 12 miles north of Yakima, Washington in Kittitas County.  The solicitation will be available on CD-ROM in Adobe Acrobat format and will be available on or about July 1, 2003 (this is an estimated date).  To obtain a copy of the CD and be included on the planholder list, interested bidders must register on our website at www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/construction.  Visit the website to obtain further instructions about registering.  If you don't provide your DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System) and TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number) on the electronic registration form, we will not send the solicitation to you.  Telephone requests for the solicitation won't be accepted.   There is no charge for the first copy of the CD and $15 for each additional copy requested.  We reserve the right to issue the solicitation on paper if it becomes necessary.   The Office of Management and Budget has instructed all federal agencies to adopt use of the Central Contactor Registration system as a single, government-wide system for storing contractor procurement and payment information.   By October 1, 2003, a vendor must be registered in the CCR in order to receive contracts and purchase orders from most federal agencies, including the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.  CCR is a self-service database.  Vendors register themselves and maintain their own information through the CCR web site. If not already registered, we encourage entities interested in USBR business to register in the system now, to avoid any disruption or loss of awards after the revised regulation takes effect.  To register or learn more about the CCR, go to:  www.ccr.gov/vendor.cfm  See numbered note 27

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (GovWorks), intends to make a sole source award to Aeronix Inc.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).  The acquisition action is to be funded as a sole source contract for development of a single baseline ground system, Improved Communications Equipment - reduced (ICEcube), to replace three (3) types of operational ground systems and the Operations and Maintenance support system for NRL.  This procurement is for the design, development, and deployment of the ICEcube system, and consists of system engineering, software development, hardware development, system integration and testing, documentation and training support.  It is necessary that the Contractor provide the following expertise for the accomplishment of these objectives: experience and knowledge of existing operational ground and maintenance systems; experience and knowledge of existing ICEcube high speed data acquisition and analysis software; ICEcube Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) design and implementation; ICEcube Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) interface card design and implementation; ICEcube PCI drivers for Solaris; ICEcube ground station operations; and ICEcube quantity hardware production and testing.  Aeronix has been working with the ICEbox system for the last 11 years and is intimately familiar with the technologies and programmatics of the system.  For another contractor to develop the same skills and expertise with the unique aspects of the system would delay the project unacceptably and result in prohibitive cost duplication.  The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  However, all information received within five (5) days of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  POC:  Department of the Interior; Attention: Richard P Bolick, 381 Elden Street - MS 2510, Herndon, VA 20170. Questions must be faxed to the attention of Richard P Bolick at (703) 787-1022 or emailed to richard.bolick@mms.gov.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

Those firms will be required to provide the necessary information to the EFLHD within 90 calendar days after receiving the RFP.  A site visit/pre-proposal meeting will be held within the first 21 days of this period to provide additional information.  It is anticipated that a stipend will be awarded to each Phase Two offeror who provides a responsive, but unsuccessful proposal (see Subsection I.A.6 of the RFP).  A copy of the draft RFP is available to interested D-B firms/teams during Phase One.

After receipt of the Phase Two Technical and Price Proposals, an Evaluation Board will conduct a “best value” analysis (see Subsection I.B.6 of the RFP), and submit their recommendations to the Selection Official for approval.  Award of one Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated approximately November 1, 2003, with Notice to Proceed issued approximately December 15, 2003.

It is not the intent of EFLHD to receive project specific design or engineering recommendations as part of this Phase One selection process.  Offerors should limit their submittals to the information required by this Notice, and other information that may be relevant to the qualifications and experience of the Offeror.  No reimbursement will be made for any expenses associated with the preparation of Phase One submittals.

Phase One Submittals:  Interested firms/teams may use Standard Forms (SF) 254 and 255, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, as the basis for their submittals.  SF 254 and 255 are available on the Government Printing Office’s website at: http://hydra.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_files.  Although SF 254 and 255 are formatted for Architect-Engineer and Related Services, the construction elements of the firms/team’s submittal may also be included on SF 254 and 255.  Alternate forms and formats may be submitted, provided that the applicable information from SF 254 and 255 is included.  The Phase One submittals shall be bound and tabbed with the major headings.

Send eight (8) copies of the completed submittals to the following address:

	Federal Highway Administration

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting for a construction contractor to improve the appearance, accessibility, signage, function and security of the main lobby and elevator lobbies/cabs that contributes to the security of the Federal Building, U.S. Post Office and Courthouse.  PROJECT OVERVIEW: The main lobby of the Federal Building Post Office and Courthouse was planned and designed to determine the scope of this First Impression Project.  The interior walls and ceiling will remain; however, a major step taken to improve the appearance of the space was to overlay, repair, and replace the flooring.  To contribute to a more cohesive appearance the deteriorated curtain wall, elevator cabs, convector covers, wood rails and planters, and doors will be refinished.  Handicap access will be improved with power-assists added to the main exterior doors.  Way finding and signage improvements include replacing the building directory and adding bulletin boards in the elevators.  To contribute to the overall security of the building, there will be a new central security station that screens everyone entering the building instead of currently screening only the people that use the elevators.  There will be public seating in the lobby so it could be used for its intended purpose.  Contractor shall be responsible for sequencing the work in order to allow safe usage of the lobbies during construction.  SELECTION PROCESS: This procurement is issued pursuant to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a sealed bidding process.  The successful offeror will be the responsive and responsible firm offering the lowest evaluated bid price for the base bid and selected options.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between two hundred fifty thousand dollars and five hundred thousand dollars ($250,000.00 and $500,000.00).  The approximate duration of the contract is five months.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220.  This procurement is UNRESTRICTED.  For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its average annual receipts are $28.5 million or less.  Joint venture offers will be considered.  The contractor’s personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.

<DESC>The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the Division of Cancer Treatment, Diagnosis and Centers (DCTD) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking organizations to carry out pharmacology and toxicology studies, the data from which must be suitable for filing with the Food and Drug Administration as part of Investigational New Drug Applications.  The organizations should have the facilities and staff to carry out such studies and the management expertise to analyze and evaluate the data.

Proposals must meet the Mandatory Qualification Criterion at the time of submission of initial proposals. As a minimum requirement, the contractors must perform all toxicology studies in accord with the FDA's current Good Laboratory Practice Regulations (GLPs).  Contractors must also indicate their willingness to sign a confidentiality of information statement.  Multiple contracts will be awarded and each will be administered on a work assignment  managed basis.  Work assignments will be issued under the "funded cost-reimbursement completion" contracts resulting from this solicitation.  Assignments are estimated to involve two to three chemical agents annually per contract.  Offerors are required to propose both levels of effort (64,015 and 127,960 hours over a 7 year period) .The objectives of the work assignments in relative order of importance are: 1) assessment of acute and subacute toxicity in rodents, dogs, non-human primates (NHPs) and other animal models including determination of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLT), schedule-dependent toxicity, the reversibility of adverse effects and of a safe clinical starting dose; 2) validation of analytical methodology to quantitate plasma drug levels in preclinical animal models and to measure plasma drug levels in animal models treated with the agent under study; 3) determination of bioavailability of drug after parenteral and/or oral administration, if efficacious drug levels can be attained in plasma in vivo and if the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier; 4) the use of pharmacokinetic information to permit extrapolation of toxic effects across species by relating plasma drug levels to the time of appearance and severity of toxicity; and to establish the safety of potentially efficacious doses.

The Principal Investigator should have a doctoral degree in pharmacology/ toxicology plus at least five years experience in directing, implementing and evaluating drug toxicity studies in experimental animals.  The Pathologist, Pharmacokineticist  and Analytical Chemist should likewise have credentials which illustrate their competence and accomplishments in serving as critical team members in the conduct of such studies.

The government anticipates multiple awards on a incremental funded basis.  Each increment will be for one year and the total contract will be awarded for a seven year period on or about February 28, 2004. All responsible offerors will be considered.   The solicitation is scheduled for electronic release approximately July 17, 2003.  The proposals will be due approximately 60 days following the actual date of RFP issuance.  The RFP may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home Page by using the following internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov It's the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above Internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  Point of contact: Diane Stalder, Contract Specialist at e-mail: ds88b@nih.gov; FAX: 301-402-6699; Telephone: 301-435-3822.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<SOLNBR>REFERENCE-NUMBER-03M000182

<ARCHDATE>07162003
<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), (DHHS) through the Program Support Center has a twelve  (12) month simplified acqusition procurement described as follows: 
Staggering numbers of children and adolescents require but don’t receive treatment for mental and substance use disorders in the US.  According to a recent analysis by SAMHSA’s Office of Applied Studies, for youths aged 12 to 17, an estimated 1.1 million persons (4.9 percent of this population) needed treatment for an illicit drug abuse problem in 2001. Of this group, only 100,000 youths (10.2 percent of youths aged 12 to 17 who needed treatment) received treatment, leaving an estimated treatment gap for youths of 1 million. In addition, almost 21 percent of children and adolescents have a diagnosable mental disorder and 11 percent have significant impairment as a result.  An estimated 70 percent of children with mental health conditions do not receive specialty mental health services. There can be devastating consequences of this treatment gap.  In 2000, approximately 3 million youths were at risk for suicide during the past year. Only 36 percent of youths at risk for suicide during the past year received any mental or substance use disorders treatment or counseling.   
The huge treatment gap for children with mental and substance use disorders points toward the need to give priority to early identification of these conditions.  Children on Medicaid, eligible due to low socioeconomic status or significant level of disability, are even more likely to need behavioral health care.  Under the Early and Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) mandate in the Medicaid Program, states are obligated to screen children on Medicaid for mental and substance use disorders. Since primary care physicians, not behavioral health specialists, usually have the responsibility to conduct EPSDT screens, states can improve the identification of behavioral health conditions by requiring that children be screened for these conditions and by providing the most effective tools to do so.  Individual state Medicaid agencies have the authority to decide how to ensure that children and adolescents are screened for mental health and substance abuse problems in EPSDT screens.  
A recent OMC-SAMHSA study found that states vary considerably in required policies and practices regarding behavioral health screening under EPSDT.  This was especially true regarding the recommended screening tools for mental and substance use disorders.   Only 27 states recommended any behavioral health screening instrument, yet  only one State actually required use of this screening tool.  Many more states have screening tools that address mental health than substance abuse.   Fifteen (15) states have specialized mental health tools compared to 4 states with specialized substance abuse tools.  Eighteen (18) states have comprehensive screening tools that reference mental health compared to 11 that reference substance abuse.  
A more surprising finding of the study--given the availability of recognized, standardized screening instruments for both mental and substance use disorders--is that most states have created their own screening tools.  It is unclear whether this reflects a discomfort with or a lack of awareness of the standardized behavioral health screening tools available. For those who recommend a mental health tool, about one-third (five of sixteen states) recommend or require a standardized mental health tool.  Of States recommending a substance abuse instrument, one quarter (one of four states) recommend or require a standardized substance abuse tool.
Such information raises a number of other questions that cannot currently be answered with national data, primarily assessing whether State recommendations cascade down through the health plan, the provider to affect care for children and adolescents.  So, when State do recommend a behavioral health screening instrument, what kind of special programs do managed care companies implement with providers to encourage their use?   What are the barriers?  Further, when States do have a recommended instrument, do primary care providers generally know this?  If they are aware of the instrument, what other reasons act as deterrents to performing such screenings?
This project seeks to build on existing understanding about behavioral health screening under EPSDT to increase utilization of scientifically based screening tools in mental and substance use disorders screening under Medicaid for children and adolescents.  The project will collect information from knowledgeable individuals on barriers to use of State recommended screening tools and use it to chart a plan of how to improve EPSDT screenings.  The project will then select one promising effort identified, plan and implement it.  
The Children and Families Matrix Workgroup support this project.  It also links with Agency Priorities Matrix in children, prevention/early intervention, science-to-service, treatment capability and the cross-cuts of financing strategies

All firms interested in being considered for this potential acquisition shall submit a written request for a copy of the solicitation to the above address by 3:00 PM EST July 1, 2003. 
E-mail and fax are accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational Epidemiology Branch (OEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with the Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., 6611 Dumbarton Circle, Fremont CA 94555.  The purpose of this procurement is to purify and characterize candidate protein markers identified in serum among benzene exposed subjects. The DCEG initiated a cross-sectional study of approximately 250 workers exposed from 0.5 to > 10 ppm benzene and 150 unexposed controls in Tianjin, China. In a previous order (263_MQ-307115) Ciphergen identified and validated proteins using specialized fractionation protocols and Ciphergen ProteinChip Arrays. Protein 1 ~8kDa and protein 2 ~9kDa..  In this follow on study the Ciphergen shall provide:  1) Purification of the two candidate proteins (m/z ~8kDa and ~9kDa); and 2) Characterization of the purified proteins.  Since purification and identification is a complex process and requires exact matching to previous experiments to ensure successful tracking of the candidate proteins in the purification process using exact similar settings and protocols as used in the previous experiments Ciphergen is the only vendor who can provide this service.  In addition, for identification a tandem-mass spectrometer equipped with a Ciphergen proprietary ProteinChip Array Interface will need to be employed to collect direct peptide fragmentation sequence information.  This service is considered commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.   However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing experiment it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on June 17, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS 541380.

<SUBJECT>66 -- META Spectral Scanner Upgrade
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NCI-30070-NV
<RESPDATE>061703
<ARCHDATE>07022003
<CONTACT>Deborah Moore, Purchasing Agent, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email dm170b@nih.gov - Renita Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-8612, Fax 301-480-0241, Email rs442i@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Synaptic Function Unit (SFU), plans to procure a META spectral scanner upgrade for the existing Zeis LSM 510 confocal microscope from Carl Zeiss Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594. The principal goal of the Synaptic Function Unit is to study the molecular mechanisms underlying neurotransmitter release and its modulation. Current projects include: 1) to determine the synaptic localization of several proteins in cultured hippocampal neurons; 2) to determine protein-protein interaction in vivo using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET); and 3) to observe vesicle movement along cytoskeletal structures of neuronal processes.  The META upgrades provides the following features:  1) The META detection module is a 32 channel PMT (Photo-Multiplier Tube) which uses a special grating for efficient, even dispersion of emission.  Furthermore, lamda stack acquisition is pixel by pixel, so the user can define the channels, and the user can collect data from the spectral detection unit;  2) The META detection model is unique in its emission fingerprinting.  This system can handle emission crosstalk as well as excitation crosstalk, and is applicable for highly overlapping emission spectra (for example fluorescent proteins and GFP or variants like FITC and Sytox Green).  The META software allows the acquisition of lambda stacks, selection of reference spectra, and separation of channels by linear unmixing; 3) The META provides unique acquisition of the whole emission spectrum with no signal restriction as opposed to imaging using band passes.  The user can define the wavelength range, and then fast, electronic selection of detector elements are performed; 4) The META provides linear unmixing.  By this, emission signals can be digitally separated quickly and efficiently, and crosstalk-free, multi-fluorescence images based on lambda stacks and measured reference spectra can be produced; 5) The META system is compatible to our existing LSM 510 confocal microscope and software; 6) Zeiss has a patent pending for multi-channel imaging with no emission crosstalk.  “Metatracking” is enhanced using fast electronic multiplexing of META detector elements.  The user can define wavelength ranges and both single detector channels and binned META detector channels using multiple pinhole settings.  For a single scan, the user can define up to four tracks.   Ratio formation between different channels is one of the procedures that can be defined as a track as well, resulting in the possibility of eight channels being recorded in a single operation; 7 Real region of interest can be measured using FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) and FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) within selected areas of the sample.  Furthermore, this can be combined with multitracking and lambda stack acquisition;  8) The DSP (Digital Signal Processor) controls the scanning, acquisition, and laser excitation.  Features include constant velocity scanning, even illumination, easily changed scanning and detection settings, sample preservation via enhanced beam blanking, and very short frame fly back times for time lapse studies (<2% of frame cycle).  Scan speeds are higher than video rate.  Scan speeds include 77 fps (512 x 32), 20 fps (512 x 128) and 5 fps (512 x 512).  In addition, scan speeds can be increased using a definable Step Scan rate, and Line and Spot Scan can be used for ultra high-speed processes; and 9) the META can perform spot scan, line scan or frame scan.  Z-stack and time series and Lambda stack acquisition, as well as Region of Interest scanning, spine scanning (freehand drawn line), step scan (scans every nth line and interpolates), full 360’ scan rotation, scan zoom, and offset, uni- and bi-directional scanning, and finally, multitracking and metatracking.  This system is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Carl Zeiss Inc. is the only organization known to the NCI researcher that can upgrade the current Zeiss system to a system that has all the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on June 17, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The determination has been made by the Government, with the assistance from SBA representatives, to set aside the  project described below for 8(a) Small Business Concerns  that are certified in Region 5, Kentucky, or Pennsylvania.  This is just a  general  announcement.  A solicitation for this project has not been  posted.  The Government intends to post a solicitation for  this project fifteen (15) days after the formal synopsis  has been posted.  Only those 8(a) contractors who have a  Region 5, Kentucky, or Pennsylvania certification will be eligible to submit a  proposal for this pending solicitation.  If you have  questions concerning your Region 5 8(a) certification,  please contact your local SBA representative. Project Number 981911A: Renovate for DPC, Facility 30002 Project Number 981911C: Provide Furniture for DPC Fac. 30002 Project Number 981911D: Provide Furniture for DPM Fac. 30002 Solicitation Number F33601-03-R-0047 The Air Force is seeking possible sources for a potential  100 percent set-aside for 8(a) small business concerns, or  sole source set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns.   If adequate responses are not received, the acquisition may  be solicited on an unrestricted basis.  This is a sources  sought notice for planning purposes only.  The work will  include the scope in the above-mentioned project numbers.   The scope will also include the architectural, electrical,  environmental, fire protection, mechanical, and plumbing  modification and reconfiguration of Bays 1, 2, 3, and 4 in  Facility 30002 to meet the functional requirements of  multiple service organizations.  In addition to providing  and installing new systems furniture, there is a  requirement to utilize and reinstall existing systems  furniture.  The estimated price range is between $1M and  $5M.  The NAICS Code is 233320. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: Facility 30002 is being  renovated to house the main administrative offices and  customer service areas for the personnel management  organizations servicing both the military and civilian  population of WPAFB.  The main organization currently  housed in this facility is the military personnel office.   Since this office will remain in operation during  construction, minimizing the impact to this mission will be  a critical concern.  The extremely high level of visibility  of this project will result in an unusually high level of  scrutiny by all levels of WPAFB leadership.  The building  currently occupied by the civilian personnel office is  scheduled for demolition.  This major renovation will  involve the complex management of numerous disciplines  (inlcuding the installation of sytems furniture), working  simultaneously, and critical phasing and scheduling  requirements.  The contractor must have extensive  experience in the management of large multi-disciplined  projects in order to successfully complete this effort.   Failure to supervise and coordinate the different trades  required to provide a quality and timely product will not  be acceptable as it would result in the disruption of the  long range plans for the using organization.  This would  trigger a "domino effect" which will negatively impact the  long range plans of several other organizations. In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, the contractor must  be registered in the CCR prior to award of solicitations  issued after 31 May 1998.  Tel: 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax: 1-703- 696-0213.  DUNS/CCR Website: http://www.ccr.gov.  Every  solicitation issued after 31 May 1998 must include the  clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, "Required Central Contractor  Registration." Prime contractors who are 8(a) or HUBZone small businesses,  and who intend to submit a bid for the solicitation (when  issued), MUST submit the following by 4:00 P.M. EST on 5  May 2003.  Responses should include the following: (1) A positive statement of your intention to submit a bid  for the potential solicitation as a Prime Contractor; (2) The date of 8(a)/HUBZone small business certification; (3) A listing of work similar in type and scope to include  contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and  points of contact with phone numbers; (4) Evidence of capability to secure performance and  payment bonds based on the estimated value range provided  above; (5) If you are an 8(a)or HUBZone company considering a  joint venture, you will need to provide proof that this  consideration has been forwarded to the cognizant SBA  office for approval. Contractors interested should provide the above  documentation in duplicate (one original and one copy).   All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for  a decision to be made on the availability of interested 8 (a) and HUBZone concerns.  Responses shall be limited to  five (5) pages.  Failure to submit all information  requested shall result in a contractor being  considered "not interested" in this requirement.  A  decision on whether or not this potential effort will be  pursued as an 8(a) set-aside, sole source HUBZone set- aside, or an unrestricted basis will be posted as a  modification in the Federal Business Opportunities.

<DESC>The US Army TACOM-ARDEC is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources for a qualified contractor to analyze, define, develop, obtain  concurrence and publish acquisition strategy templates that show the conditions  for component breakout versus systems contracting for artillery and mortar  munitions families of ammunition. Background:  The Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems is the artillery  and mortar-procuring agency for the US Army and several other military  agencies, and it is responsible for the efficient procurement of ammunition  items at the best possible advantage for the US Government consistent with  maintenance of long-term procurement sources of supply and unyielding standards  for quality.  Over the last several decades, the practice of managing the  individual procurement parts of individual ammunition items has become the  norm.  In many cases, this individual management schema is warranted, but  alternative strategies to individual procurement are available. Requirement:  What is needed, is a study to examine the current procurement  practices and recommend changes to improve the acquisition process and save  acquisition funding, if possible.  The government specifically seeks firms with  qualifications to demonstrate the ability to remain unbiased and have prior  functional knowledge of PM, CAS and PM, CAS future plans.  The overall effort  will require the contractor to draft a project plan that describes in detail  how the project will be performed and controlled.  The draft project plan shall  describe how the contractor intends to develop the templates and perform the  artillery and mortar acquisition assessments.  The requirement will consist of  two parts:  (1) the contractor shall develop the acquisition templates.  The  purpose of the templates is to fully describe the key elements of the  ammunition procurement process to ensure that the analysis team fully  understands the issues and the potential opportunities to apply acquisition  reform techniques.  The contractor shall develop a series of templates  notionally thought of as:  Artillery projectile – Non-Precision; Artillery  projectile – Precision; Artillery propellant; Mortar projectile – Non- Precision; Mortar projectile – Precision; Mortar propellant.  The acquisition  templates shall flow in time (schedule) and performance (tasks) the required  effort to apply best business practices to the acquisition of ammunition.  The  contractor shall analyze, define, develop and document the templates, rationale  for specified actions and the specific value added accorded to application of  the templates.  And, (2):  The contractor shall convene Working Integrated  Product Teams (WIPT) to analyze current and planned procurements and apply the  acquisition templates/best practices and document the results which will be  presented to the PM CAS.  The WIPT shall be responsible for understanding the  effects of current acquisition strategies and procurements in terms of  procurement costs, procurement risk as measured by WIPT approved metrics on  quality, schedule, contract overrun, etc., and industrial base impacts.  Each  current and planned acquisition shall be documented with opportunity cost  analysis of application of a selected template; definitive statements of  savings resulting from template application in the areas of procurement cost,  industrial base cohesion, cost, schedule and producibility risk, and item  performance; and roll-up comparison of the man-years of effort saved by  template application. This market survey is for planning purposes at this point and should not be  construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US  Government. Interested sources should respond with their qualifications detailing their  capability to comply with the anticipated requirement addressing the following: 1. Significant Department of Defense Acquisition Management knowledge focusing  on demonstrated achievements of application of Acquisition Reform principals, 2. Number of ammunition procurement contracts either as a prime or    subcontractor for the last five years, 3. Number of munitions system on-site program office support activities within  last five years, 4. Detailed knowledge of the decision support toolset "Combat Ammunition Plan"  under development to demonstrate understanding of linkages of future PM CAS  plans to requirements Interested firms are to submit expressions of interest electronically to the  undersigned no later than 15 calendar days after the issuance date of this  Market Survey request to OPM CAS, Bldg 171A, Attn:  Mr. J. Irizarry, Picatinny  Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 (email: jirizarry@pica.army.mil).

<DESC>bruce.cook@hill.af.mil	Repair of Traveling Wave Tube/Vacuum Electron Devices (TWT/VED)
This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI).  Its intent is to notify potential contractors of a potential, TWT/VED requirement.  Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) is proposing to combine the repair of all Vacuum Electron Devices (VED) for the Air Force Materiel Command into one requirement.  This is the initial effort or Phase I; it is our intent to expand this requirement for any additional Department of Defense VEDs that are deemed advantageous and effective to be included.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  
Attached is a preliminary list of TWTs/VEDs to be included.    
The Government is requesting information to better understand this requirement and industry capabilities.  Your input will be used to identify and resolve concerns regarding acquisition strategy and the feasibility of the requirement.  The below list of questions are areas we have concerns and would like to have industry input.  Your response does not need to be limited to these questions.  
1.  The items that have an Expendability, Reparability, Recoverability Category Code (ERRC) of “N” or “P” are expendable – is it possible to have these repaired, i.e. can anyone repair them?
2.  Solid state development – are any of the NSNs listed possible conversions to solid state technology?  If so, what would that entail?  What reasonable incentives could be built into a future contract that would help this technology shift?
3.  Do any contractors have Advanced Planning Scheduling Systems (APS) that would allow us access/insight into repair status of parts they repair?
4.  Would anyone be interested in seeing the AF’s demand forecasting thru an APS system?
5.  What is a strategy you would recommend the AF could use to efficiently acquire repair services and establish long-term relationships?
6.  What incentives could be tied to a contract to help contractors in their repair processes for the AF?
7.  What other DoD tubes do you repair that we may not have listed here?
8.  Do you have a working relationship or an understanding of the capabilities and expertise of Crane/NAVSEA in Crane, Indiana?
9.  Would you participate in an Industry Day where the government intends to outline their strategy for consolidation of AF tube requirements?
10.  What are your frustrations dealing with the AF when repairing vacuum electron tubes?  What could we do to make the process better and easier for you?
11.  Identify if you are a large or small business.

Request contractors that are interested or have input to this RFI respond to either of the Contracting Officers listed below.  Responses are due by 19 June 2003.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION – THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  This RFI requests information needed by the Government prior to release of any potential solicitation.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is requesting information on commercially available, small, two-man portable, tethered or un-tethered, unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) systems, including platforms, sensors, communications, navigation subsystems, and tactical displays suitable for application in rapidly reconnoitering underwater areas of concern (e.g., ship hulls, harbor/port areas and other underwater areas). Information requested will assist the government in examining alternatives for Navy EOD forces to operate in the littorals with unmanned systems to improve ove rall mission effectiveness, reduce their tactical timeline, and reduce risk to man-in-the-water solutions.  Areas of particular interest are: -	Hardware systems that can be operated in an un-tethered mode for systematic search and identify schemes, or in a tethered/hovering mode for object investigation.    -	Systems that can search, investigate and rapidly localize, and identify unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) objects in harbors and seaward approaches out to water depths of 300 feet.  -	Real-time or near real-time feedback on searched areas is desired, particularly when time is a critical factor in search and object localization operations (Post-mission data retrieval and analysis is still acceptable in some scenarios.) -	Navigation systems that minimize degradation from high turbidity, harbor noise, magnetic anomalies or poor acoustics performance due to shallow water . -	Solutions that allow for unmanned search and precise mapping and sensing of the below water portions of steel and non-ferrous hull-forms, hull protrusions, running gear, bottom clutter, and areas between and around pilings characteristic of harbors and berthing areas are also of interest.   -	Modular, plug and play payloads for up and/or down-looking operations .  -	Small UUVs and platforms currently under development that are planned to become available in the 2006/2007 timeframe.   This information will be utilized in an Analysis of Alternatives study that precedes a planned UUV acquisition program scheduled to begin in FY 2004.  Performance description information is sought in the form of brochures, specification sheets and company points of contact.    Design proposals requiring developmental funding are not of interest at this time.   This synopsis is for informat ion and planning purposes ONLY, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Submit responses to Commander, Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division, 2008 Stump Neck Road, Indian Head, MD 20640-5070, Attn: Margaret Booth Code 0521 or email at boothma@eodpoe2.navsea.navy.mil not later than 30 June 2003.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  In preparation for a future procurement, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a "market research" to determine potential sources that are small businesses.  The EPA Office of Water has a requirement for a contractor to provide Survey Statistics Support. To fulfill its mission, OW conducts surveys to collect data and uses survey data from other sources to evaluate regulatory options, policies, and other program initiatives under the provisions of the Clean Water Act.  Typical data collection activities involve self-administered (mail) business surveys of facilities within specified industrial categories and subcategories.  Other types of surveys conducted include environmental (or field surveys) of waters, soils, biosolids and fish tissue.   The services to be performed under this contract are limited to technical support services related to general survey statistical support and statistical documentation.  These services do not include market research or opinion surveys, and EPA will not consider such experience as demonstrating capability to perform the services for this contract. To be considered a potential source, a firm must demonstrate they have the necessary labor, materials, services, equipment and facilities to support the efforts delineated by the Statement of Work (SOW).  Services to be performed include: developing statistical sample plans for self-administered business surveys, developing spatial environmental sample plans that will allow for statistical inferences from the data, analyzing business survey data using statistical survey techniques, and statistically analyzing spatial environmental data. Firms should be aware that quick turn-around of multiple deliverables is sometimes necessary to allow EPA to meet court-mandated, statutory and other deadlines. To be considered a potential source, a firm also must have personnel with demonstrated experience in survey statistical techniques applied to data collected from business or establishment surveys that are conducted through the mail.  A firm will not be considered a potential source based upon experience with household or personal surveys.  Experience with business surveys is preferred, but experience with establishment surveys will also be considered applicable experience.  In addition, the firm must have personnel with educational background in advanced survey statistics. In addition, a potential source would need to demonstrate experience with statistical analysis of spatial data.  Experience with environmental sampling data with spatial aspects is preferable. Documentation support that will be required by the contract must adhere to professional technical writing and editing styles, and may include: explanations of the survey statistical methodology and results of data analyses. This is a continuing requirement, but expands work now being done under 68-C-99-242.  It is anticipated to be a CPFF, Level of Effort contract and will have a base period of 12 months with (2) twelve month option periods.  The base period and each option period will consist of approximately 2,500 direct labor hours.  Each contract period will also have approximately 2,500 additional direct labor hours of optional level of effort. In total for the three years of potential performance, the maximum Level of Effort is anticipated at 15,000 direct labor hours. The applicable NAICS code is 541611 with a size standard of $6,000,000.  ANY INTERESTED FIRM should submit a capability statement which demonstrates the firm's ability to perform the key requirements described above.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.  In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS, (i.e. large, small, woman-owned, 8(a) and/or disabled veteran owned concern).  Responses to the above should be submitted to sclafani.jamie@epa.gov no later than 07/08/03.  Draft SOW can be accessed at the Cincinnati Procurement Operation Division website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Census (BOC) intends to negotiate a single source contract with Javier Miranda of Washington, DC for the improvement and extension of the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD). The LBD is a dataset consisting of longitudinally linked records from the Census Bureau's Business Register and the Business Register's predecessor, the Standard Statistical Establishment List. The BOC has a requirement to improve the LBD in the following ways: identify and flag of administrative births and deaths in the LBD, upgrade the OLDID-NEWID matching algorithms to reduce the number of spurious births and deaths and incorrect establishment-age assignments in the LBD, evaluate the usefulness of the Predecessor/Successor EIN file in identifying reorganizations in the LBD, create NAICS industry codes and correct inconsistent industry codes in the LBD, generate pointer data between the establishment-level data in the LBD and firm-level identifiers,  add the most recent years of Business Register Data to the LBD and develop and document  new procedures to introduce additional years of microdata from the revised Business Register Data to the LBD.  It is the Government's belief that the only Javier Miranda has the qualifications to satisfy the BOC's requirement. This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, responses received within the required time will be reviewed and evaluated.  Interested companies having the capability to provide the above described services should submit, in writing, their capability statement with cost information to the above address, Attn.: Gloria Smith, email to gloria.i.smith@census.gov, or fax @ (301) 457-1785 within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>Background:  Conceived in November of 2001 by the Quicksilver E-Government Task Force, the Federal Asset Sales (FAS) program is designed to improve and optimize the way that the federal government recovers and disposes of all types of federally owned assets – real property, financial property, and personal property.  Each year the Federal Government disposes of and sells billions of dollars of surplus under- and un-utilized, seized, and forfeited assets.  Assets are sold to the public through a variety of inefficient, fragmented sales processes that; fail to maximize sales revenues, result in higher costs of sales operations and longer sales cycles, and make it difficult for citizens to find Federal assets for sale.  FAS seeks the services of a service aggregator that can assist Federal agencies with selling and disposing of personal property assets.  The solicitation will focus exclusively on creating a performance-based, best-value solution for selling personal property assets.  There will be three component services sought under the FAS personal property solicitation; Development (One-Time Creation of the e-Marketplace solution), E-Marketplace Operations (Continuous online sales transactions through single or multiple online auction E-Marketplaces), Value-Added Services (VAS) Operations (Provide interested agencies with optional services to aggregate and channel assets to the most effective online/offline sales venues, and support pre- and post-sales activities, for example: Strategic Asset Segmentation, Refine Asset Description and Standardize Asset Condition, Warehousing and Asset Transportation Buyer Qualification, Full Service Marketing, Inspection Support, Asset Valuation and Appraisals, Settlement Support, Title/Escrow Transfer, Logistics and Shipping, Payment Collection).  Capability:  The Successful awardee and its sub-contractors must have a broad range of capabilities for fulfilling the needs and outcomes of the FAS initiative.  Capabilities include, but are not limited to: effectively aggregate assets and channel similar assets to the most beneficial sales channel; charge competitive and reasonable rates for asset disposal channels and services; use established channels (i.e. e-Marketplaces/VAS providers) to leverage existing commercial best practices, and create new channels as appropriate; market to Federal Agencies, acquiring additional surplus assets.  FAS’ Procurement/Desired Outcomes:  Service Provider must have the potential to compete in a competition for providing:  Increase agencies’ net proceeds from asset sales; Help federal agencies determine the most effective channel available to dispose of their assets; Decrease agencies’ expenses related to asset sales; Accelerate asset disposal cycle time; Make it easier for citizens, businesses, and government agencies to find and buy government personal property assets.  The objective of this RFI is to obtain capabilities statements, based upon the requirements outlined above, from all (large and small) businesses interested in this opportunity. Contractors should identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside, restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources. Identify your interest in either being a Prime or Subcontractor for this requirement. Should the procurement be set-aside for small business, FAR clause 52.219-14 “Limitations on Subcontracting” (DEC 1996) will apply.  Small businesses, interested in bidding as a prime contractor under a set-aside program, must provide sufficient information to demonstrate that compliance with this requirement can be met.  All interested businesses are hereby invited to submit a capabilities statement of no more than ten pages (not including past performance information) to demonstrate their ability to provide the services outlined above. The capabilities statement should be tailored to this request and identify the source(s) capabilities to complete the requirements listed above, including information on key staff experience and a description of corporate experience with similar projects of like size and complexity, present and past performance information. For each reference listed include the name of a contact person, telephone number, e-mail address, type of contract awarded and date. In addition to addressing the requirements listed above respondents must provide information concerning gross revenue, number of employees in company, number of years in existence and primary focus of business.  In order for the FAS to assess acquisition strategy and set-aside possibilities, interested parties shall also include a cover letter that includes company name, points of contact, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses, prime or sub-contractor interest, and identifies the company as one or more of the following: 1) small business; 2) 8(a) business; 3) HUBZone small business; 4) small disadvantaged business; 5) woman-owned small business; (6) veteran-owned small business; (7) service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or (8) large business. Please note: This Sources Sought/RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought/RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Response to the request will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Address responses to:  All responses to this Sources Sought/RFI must be received by 4:00 P.M. EST on Tuesday, June 24, 2003. Point of Contact: Kyle A. Turner, Contracting Officer, Kyle.Turner@gsa.gov   Offerors are encouraged to check the FAS website at http://egov.gsa.gov to the link to Federal Asset Sales, on a regular basis as all information concerning the above action will be posted there.

<DESC>ARMAMENT/MUNITIONS DIGITAL MODELING & SIMULATION (AMDMS) SOFTWARE.   The 46th Test Wing, a leader in weapon system test and evaluation (T&E), has a new initiative to modernize and improve  our modeling, simulation and analysis (MS&A) capabilities for comprehensive T&E of developmental air armament systems.  The 46th Test Wing is soliciting Concept White Papers addressing unique and creative solutions for advancing digital MS&A in support of developmental, operational, and Live Fire T&E of air armament.  We are seeking ideas that (1) improve existing MS&A tools, techniques and methodologies for conventional weapons T&E; and (2) develop next generation digital MS&A tools, techniques and methodologies, to prepare for emerging tactical, area denial, and directed energy weapons T&E.  The intention is a systematic integration of models developed by laboratories, AAC, and contractors into common suites of reusable modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A) tools.  The goal is to reduce expensive open air testing and increase the value of fewer smarter tests.  This project will also facilitate a seamless transition of M&S between the research & development, developmental T&E, simulation, and flight T&E communities.  The Armament/Munitions T&E community requires a full spectrum of credible digital models and simulations that are interoperable, correlatable, and portable; with a full range of resolution and response time to meet the needs of the T&E customer.  AMDMS requirements include: performance/effectiveness, aircraft integration and compatibility models; separation and fly-out models; survivability; and end game models for lethality/vulnerability and seeker/signature.  Some models must support the High-Level Architecture (HLA) and/or other protocols to support distributed connections with joint test and training facilities.  The Concept White Papers may include the modeling and simulation of phenomenon related to the development, testing or employment of Armament currently in the AF inventory or under consideration for development or acquisition, including but not limited to: precison guided munitions, directed energy weapons, hard target defeat, conventional blast/fragmentation, area denial, non-lethal defense, and hypersonic weapon systems.  Priority will be given to those concepts and ideas that provide a viable migration strategy from existing simulation tools towards robust extensible architectures with wide application or ideas that directly address shortfalls in simulation tools for  emerging technologies.  DO NOT SUBMIT FORMAL PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME.  Potential offerors are encouraged to contact the AMDMS Technical Director about their ideas before submitting white papers.  Offerors are required to submit via email (AMDMS@eglin.af.mil) a 3 - 5 page white paper with cover letter in Adobe Acrobat PDF format.  However, if email capability is not available, submit three copies of the white paper to the AMDMS Technical Director at the address shown below.  The white paper shall be formatted as follows:  Section A:  Title, Submitter, Date, Email Address, Phone Number, Fax Number, Organization/Office symbol, Address, Period of Performance, Cost of Effort; Section B:  Proposed Solution; Section C:  Technical Summary.  Multiple white papers addressing different research areas may be submitted by each offeror.  However, each white paper must address only one concept.  White papers may be submitted at any time.  However, to be considered for FY04 funding they should be submitted by 1 August 2003.  For follow-on years, submit white papers by 1 July of each year to obtain the greatest chance for the funding in the next FY.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical and cost proposal.  Authors of white papers whose concepts are not selected for further consideration will be notified with a written non-selection letter.  Offeror’s proposals will be evaluated based on its technical merit in addressing the areas described in this announcement, the past performance of the offeror in accomplishing similar work, and the reasonableness of the costs proposed. An invitation to submit a formal proposal based upon a submitted white paper does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract.  Questions on the technical objectives or preparation of the white paper should be posted to AMDMS@eglin.af.mil or mailed to the AMDMS Technical Director.  Please direct contractual questions to Contract Specialist, Dona Dowdy-Merchant, at 850-882-0185 or email: dona.dowdy-merchant@eglin.af.mil.  Offerors may be required to establish third party agreements with other contractors.  Eligibility to access classified information may be required, depending on what ideas or concepts are proposed.   Proprietary data must bear an appropriate restrictive legend.  Any classified materials must be identified as such, and marked and packaged in accordance with the Industrial Security Manual. Offerors that cannot meet the requirements for access to US export controlled information need not apply, foreign offerors will be considered only in unusual circumstances.

<SUBJECT>BUSCH VACUUM PUMPING SYSTEM
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory, Pittsburgh, PA intends to issue a Sole Source Simplified Purchase Order to Rogers Machinery Company, Eugene, OR for a Busch Vacuum Pumping System to be used at our Albany Research Center, Albany, Or.  The Vacuum System must include an MD Pneumatics vacuum booster; 1, Inlet filter assembly rated at 10 microns; 1, Busch NP0169 dry vacuum pump; 2, Magnetic X-line motor starters; 1, NEMA 12 junction box, prewired; 1, Busch Panda Blower model WV500 rotary positive displacement blower; and 1, prewired control panel mounted on the compressor skid.  Control panel is in a NEMA 4/12 electrical enclosure to include the following - a main power switch, programmable controller, off/on motor control buttons, hour meter, audible and visual alarms with resets, system status indicators for power on, pump on, inter-stage temperature, cooling water temperature, discharge gas temparature, and 4-20 ma output for remote inlet vacuum monitoring.  This is considered a sole source acquisition due to the pumping system is for use on an induction furnace located in Building 23ARC. This new system will help the Center meet two of its identified significant aspects for the Center's ISO 14001 Certification scheduled for completion by end od CY 2003.  Standardization of service and parts with the other Busch compressors on Center will reduce cost in parts and maintenance learning curves.  In order to standardize these systems for ease of maintenance, minimization of spares, and to drastically reduce the learning curve for successful operation; it is necessary to use the same vendor, Rogers Machinery.  Purchase of another Busch product will allow the utiliztion of thousands of dollars worth of spares and because this equipment is so similar to the other Busch systems, it will drastically reduce the time it iwll take to get the new equipment into full service.  Rogers Machinery is the only vendor available with the specific equipment that will allow for the integration of this apparatus into the Center's entire compressor maintenance system. This system is now utilized on very frequent basis by two cooperative projects, one of which has extremely tight deadlines and involves the alloying of platinum during the melting process.  Cooperators travel from San Diego whenever these melts are made to verify the actual use of the platinum.  The cooperators on this project is the number one industrial cooperator in ARC history.  A breakdown in the primary melter, the vacuum induction furnace, is unacceptable.  Rogers Machinery has a guarenteed 2 hour response service guarantee that is critical to ensuring that initial alloying is done in an acceptable time frame.  No other vendor has the id able to come close to this response guarantee.  No solicitation will be issued.  Interested parties may submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement within 15 calendar days of publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government.  Any interested party may contact Mr. Robert L. Mohn.  ANY AND ALL INQUIRES ARE TO SUBMITTED BY FAX 9412-386-5770) OR E-MAIL (mohn@netl.doe.gov).

The Model SPJ-144-X4RT8 Pulse Jet Dust Collector will contain the following:  1) Ryton singed fabric bags (set of 144) - 2 each; 2) Platform with rallings - 1 each; 3) Enclosed ladder - 1 each; 4) Slide gate 11 1/4" x 11 1/4" - 1 each; 5) Drum adaptor for 55 gallon drum - 1 each; 6) High temperature option - 1 each; 7) High temperature epoxy paint and sandblast inside and Outside - 1 each and 8)  DELIVERY:  FOB Destination is required (all freight included).  This is considered a sole souce acquisition because the Albany Research Center has a number of continuous and non-continuous cleaning baghouses on site.  Scientific Dust Collectors Inc have supplied all the recent continuous cleaning baghouses.  Significant amounts of fundng will be saved by standardizing on one brand of continuous cleaning baghouses.  This would allow for the stocking and purchase of only one set of spares for these systems and would save in ease of maintenance through less training and familiarization with the use of only one set of equipment.  This vendor is the contractor for numerous continuous cleaning baghouses on the center.  No other vendor makes compatible systems and has the spare parts and components that  would interchange with the proposed system.  No solicitation will be issued. Interested parties may submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement within 15 calendar days of publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government.  This acquisition is set aside for small businesses only.  Any interested party may contact Mr. Robert L. Mohn.

<SUBJECT>Physical Access Control - Common Access Card Technical Forum
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Charleston (SPAWARSYSCEN) is conducting a Physical Access Control ? Common Access Card Technical Forum on 09 JUL 2003 in Washington, DC (location to be determined) from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm.  For years, manufacturers of Access Control Systems and readers have been asking the Federal Government for a set of policies and standards to govern the procurement of such systems for myriad Federal Agencies.  Several of these agencies have reached a consensus on Government Smart Cards/Common Access Cards and their role in the physical access community.  Further, a consensus has emerged on a Federal Credential Numbering scheme among these same agencies.  The vision embraced by these agencies is the recognition of a single credential or token for physical access across the entire federal government enterprise.  The Department of Defense?s most recent policy guidance on the use of the Common Access Card as the principal token for access to DOD bases, facilities and buildings reflects that vision.  While the opportunities for success are immense, the challenges to realizing this vision are daunting.  One such challenge is changing the commonly held definition of an ?enterprise?.  The federal government enterprise can no longer be measured in terms of hundreds or even thousands.  The new definition must be at least an order of magnitude above and deal with an enterprise of millions.  You are most cordially invited to a technical discussion of the opportunities and challenges this vision entails.  This technical discussion will be to provide clarity and foster cooperation between system manufacturers, reader manufacturers, and the federal government.  Any company that wishes to participate in this forum must convey its interest to Mr. Frank Mazzone, by e-mail at frank.mazzone@navy.mil, or by Office Phone: (843) 218-5411 or Mobile Phone: (843) 729-2601 by 23 JUN 2003. Participation in this forum is limited to three (3) representatives per Corporation.  The proposed agenda for the forum is stated below: PROPOSED AGENDA Federal Government Perspective Department of Defense Perspective Standards Perspective  Communications  Credentialling Access Control Systems  Enterprise Definition  Reciprocity Definition Established Rules and Models  Encoding Model  Access Control Portal Model
