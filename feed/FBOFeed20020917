<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for sustaining engineering of Spacelab Program Hardware assets. The Contractor shall provide the following services: a.     Spacelab hardware sustaining engineering project management. b. Resolution of any problems arising during storage and/or handling of the Spacelab hardware. c.  Maintainence of master files of released drawings and configuration controlled non-drawing documents and databases for the Spacelab hardware provided as GFE.   d.      Coordinating generic Operations and Maintenance Requirements and Specifications changes associated with the Spacelab hardware. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the services from SPACEHAB Incorporated under statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: 10 U.S. C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  SPACEHAB Inc. has both single and double space flight qualified pressurized habitable modules in their inventory and available for use.  The Contractor has made a significant capital investment in the development of the SPACEHAB modules, their integration and operations processes, and ground processing facilities.  These are the only commercially owned pressurized habitable modules extant for use as payload carriers in the Orbiter cargo bay.  To operate the modules and install them in the bay on any Space Shuttle mission, including the pending STS-107, STS-116 and STS-118 missions, requires a selection of module internal components and external tunnel segments and support hardware obtained from Spacelab Program assets and provided to SPACEHAB Inc. as GFE.  The Boeing Company - Huntsville, SPACEHAB=92s subcontractor for module missions, maintained and modified the Spacelab hardware when the company was McDonnell Douglas =96 Huntsville.=20 Many of the same people are still with Boeing and SPACEHAB today, giving an unbroken chain of technical knowledge on the hardware from its original design to its current use and facilitating sustaining engineering. This makes SPACEHAB Inc. the only U.S. commercial company capable of performing this task in the short time available.	       The nature of performing sustaining engineering also requires access to the privately owned, restricted access SPACEHAB modules and a familiarity with SPACEHAB and Boeing work processes and paperwork, quality and safety processes, and test and checkout procedures.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 2, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The following announcement is made pursuant to section 3.2.1.2.1 (Market Analysis) of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The FAA, Terminal Business Service, Automation Sector (ATB-200) is contemplating the procurement of an information display and control system. The FAA intends to employ streamlined acquisition procedures that provide best value to the agency for a multi-year procurement beginning in FY04.   <P> The new system is intended to integrate the agency's information display and control systems.  It would replace the agency's Information Display Systems (IDS4),  Automated Surface Observing System Controller Equipment Information Display Systems (ACE-IDS) and possibly other systems.  The new system would provide immediate access to a wide range of operational information and support data; provide display for external systems; provide consolidated control and monitoring of airfield systems and provide standardized human machine interface to all systems.  An objective of the system is to function as the display and interface portion of other systems, eliminating the need to introduce additional displays and control panels into air traffic control towers.  <P> Examples of data to be displayed include, but are not limited to: Approach Plates, Sectional and Low Altitude En Route Charts, Standard Instrument Departure(SIDS)/ Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STARS), Terminal Area Charts, Notices to Airmen(NOTAMS), Letters of Agreement, Air Traffic Control Orders, Standard Operating and Emergency Procedures, and additional facility specific material. <P> Examples of external systems to be displayed include, but are not limited to: Flight Data Input/Output (FDIO), Weather and Radar Processor (WARP), Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS), Automation of Field Operations and Service (AFOS), Clock, Digital Altimeter Setting Indicator (DASI), Low Level Windshear Alert System (LLWAS), Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS), and Runway Visual Range (RVR). <P> Examples of systems to be monitored and controlled include, but are not limited to: Approach Lighting Systems with Sequenced Flashers (ALSF), Medium-intensity Approach Lighting System with sequential flashing lights (MALSR), Instrument Landing System (ILS), Operator Video Control Panel for the Airport Surveillance Radar models 9/11 (ASR-9/11), Runway End Identifier Lighting (REIL), Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) and field power and emergency generator systems. <P> Consideration is being given to separating the field system monitoring and control functions from the operational air traffic control information.  Therefore, two separate systems could be procured or one larger, partitioned system with sufficient redundancy, whichever is deemed most operationally efficient and cost effective for the agency. <P> This announcement is made pursuant to the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.8.4, Required Sources of Products, Services and use of Government Sources.  The FAA intends to procure (to the extent possible) a COTS/NDI system and is interested in potential participant firms with demonstrated success with similar systems operating in an air traffic control environment.  If you believe your firm satisfies this threshold requirement, please provide a description of your available product, your company name and address, contact person and a valid e-mail address.  This information may be e-mailed to Ted.Page@faa.gov or sent to Ted Page at 300 D Street S.W., Suite 340, Washington, DC 20024. <P>

<DESC>The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4 to JVN Communications, Inc. (JVN) to install hardware and software to support the SDR/ SAS Replacement (SDRR) project.  This includes installation of three (3) modified FIRS (FAA Interfacility and Radar Simulator) system and one Simulation Laboratory plus 54 months of technical support.  It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to acquire these engineering support services on a single source basis for the following reasons: <P> The FIRs is a large complex integrated hardware system with approximately two million lines of executable software.  For the last twelve years, JVN has been developing this software for the WJHTC.  Many FAA programs at the field sites and at the William J. Hughes Technical Center are dependent upon the continued development and enhancement of the FIRS software.  These programs include STAR and Common ARTS programs where FIRS has become part of the baseline NAS equipment for field sites at Terminal ATC operational and support facilities including the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City.  FIRs is also used for Oceanic and En Route ATC projects at the WJHTC.  During the last twelve years at the WJHTC, JVN has shown that it can provide all of the technical skills required to support the FIRS. <P> During this time, JVN has developed radar analysis software and firmware for the various COTS communications cards used in simulators, analyzers and recorders.  Resources available only from JVN have developed and managed radar and other NAS interface simulations for the WJHTC.  Specifically, they have provided libraries of communications drivers and firmware for use in numerous analyzers, recorders, and simulators.  These libraries include TCP/IP LAN based radar servers and a 72-channel digital recorder.  Currently, JVN is developing software drivers to support the ASTERIX radar data format.   <P> Based on the above, JVN is the only source with the combination of skills and proven track record to satisfy the FAAs requirement to maintain and enhance the FIRS family of products in a timely and effective manner. <P> A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firms capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Laurel P. Wittman, Contracting Officer, by 4 p.m. Eastern Time, September 19, 2002, at the FAA William J. Hughes, Contracts Branch, ACX-52, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ  08405. <P>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for one (1) each 1.54/2.2 GHz R/LHCP Feed Downconverter, p/n 990010501. This requirement is for a dual band feed (S and L bands) for the SEDL 3 meter parabolic reflector antenna.  This downconverter consists of feed element, pre-select filter, low noise amplifier and downconverter for dual bands. The SARSAT program requirements for narrow band, high selectivity and sensitivity and very stable downconverter frequency to facilitate Doppler processing require that the vendor possess sufficient expertise and experience with this type system to understand the requirements.=20 Additionally, the new feed system must be enclosed in a weather tight housing that will mate with the existing prime focus antenna mount.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from  Quorum Communications, 8304 Esters Blvd., Irving, TX  75063.  Quorum Communications currently has six feed assemblies of this type in operation at GSFC, three of which are mounted on the same model antenna as the SEDL.	Mechanical interface compatibility with the existing antenna feed support structure will preclude the need to develop additional mounting hardware adaptations.=20 Quorum Communications has the expertise to design and fabricate the required feed assembly and the experience to deliver this equipment in a timely manner.	No comparable product is readily available. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 4, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541513 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) anticipates that a purchase order will be awarded as a result of other than full and open competition. The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.301-2, "Only one responsible source  and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements." A firm-fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this requirement. Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The period of performance is expected to begin on October 15, 2002.  The  EPA intends to award a sole source purchase order to Circadian Information Systems, 274 Summer Street, Boston MA 02210-01123 to replace energy data analysis software and hardware that will enable EPA to have EnterpriseOne as a fully functional utility monitoring and tracking system.  The software  application and hardware will import energy and other utility data from the existing energy management system, metering system or data logging device.  The software/hardware shall be capable of coordinating replacement computer hardware components; tracking components; and project scheduling  adjustments.  In addition it shall include consulting of replacement computer hardware components to be ordered; tracking components; coordinating the licensing of additional Tenore software; accepting delivery of components; and unpacking/repacking of documenting components.  Also it shall include  application engineering and programming to reload software on replacement computer hardware components; modify software; and test Tenore system software.  EPA believes Circadian Information Systems is the only source for reconfiguration and hardware interface since they are providing the remainder  of the system under an existing purchase order and have the exclusive rights to the required software.  NAICS No. 541513 applies, with a size standard of $18M in average annual receipts over the last three years..  All interested parties must respond within 15 calendar days of this date of  announcement with a capability statement. Interested parties who believe they are qualified to perform this effort shall: 1) include information on the proposed services which clearly support the requirement outlined above and; 2) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination  that competition is feasible.   Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements. Response to this synopsis must be provided in writing.  Submit responses  to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP  Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), Attn: Laconda Cannady, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 for consideration by the Agency. No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice, the Government will proceed with the  procurement of these services with Circadian Information Systems.

(D) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ.  (E) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have an exceptional performance risk rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.

(F) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of ?very good? or lower.  In that event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  (xi) The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions?Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a mission to develop and promote measurements, standards, and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade, and improve the quality of life.  NIST conducts several programs in support of U.S. manufacturing, including the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL), the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP).  The RFQ will focus on improving the strategies by which NIST evaluates funding opportunities in support of U.S. manufacturing industries.  The NIST programs that serve U.S. manufacturing must be aware of the measurement, standards, and technology needs of manufacturers and are always interested in learning about opportunities to support advanced manufacturing.  This effort should bring together many and varied resources from the U.S. manufacturing sector.  The results should be a report that authoritatively documents and identifies emerging technologies, market trends,  and industries that represent viable opportunities for NIST to better support and communicate about advanced manufacturing.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4 to JVN Communications, Inc. (JVN) to install hardware and software to support the SDR/ SAS Replacement (SDRR) project.  This includes installation of three (3) modified FIRS (FAA Interfacility and Radar Simulator) system and one Simulation Laboratory plus 54 months of technical support.  It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to acquire these engineering support services on a single source basis for the following reasons: <P> The FIRs is a large complex integrated hardware system with approximately two million lines of executable software.  For the last twelve years, JVN has been developing this software for the WJHTC.  Many FAA programs at the field sites and at the William J. Hughes Technical Center are dependent upon the continued development and enhancement of the FIRS software.  These programs include STAR and Common ARTS programs where FIRS has become part of the baseline NAS equipment for field sites at Terminal ATC operational and support facilities including the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City.  FIRs is also used for Oceanic and En Route ATC projects at the WJHTC.  During the last twelve years at the WJHTC, JVN has shown that it can provide all of the technical skills required to support the FIRS. <P> During this time, JVN has developed radar analysis software and firmware for the various COTS communications cards used in simulators, analyzers and recorders.  Resources available only from JVN have developed and managed radar and other NAS interface simulations for the WJHTC.  Specifically, they have provided libraries of communications drivers and firmware for use in numerous analyzers, recorders, and simulators.  These libraries include TCP/IP LAN based radar servers and a 72-channel digital recorder.  Currently, JVN is developing software drivers to support the ASTERIX radar data format.   <P> Based on the above, JVN is the only source with the combination of skills and proven track record to satisfy the FAAs requirement to maintain and enhance the FIRS family of products in a timely and effective manner. <P> A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firms capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Laurel P. Wittman, Contracting Officer, by 4 p.m. Eastern Time, September 19, 2002, at the FAA William J. Hughes, Contracts Branch, ACX-52, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ  08405. <P>

RESPONSES: All proposals shall be submitted to the following address:  22d Contracting Squadron (Bldg 732), Attention 1Lt Laura Farley, 53147 Kansas St STE 102, McConnell AFB, KS 67221 no later than 1615 20 September 

..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................THE FOLLOWING ISSUES WERE ADDRESSED AT THE SITE VISIT HELD ON 9 SEPTEMBER AT 1400HRS.... Pictures of the site are available upon request as well as information on the operational sequence of the fire alarm system. Please email requests for pictures and/or operational sequence info, of panels and sytem to laura.farley@mcconnell.af.mil (Lt Laura Farley)...... 1. There will be no abort switches for the AFFF fire control system in the North Bay. This is per McConnell?s Fire Department........ 2. Persons installing fire control panels must be certified or have a certified person present........... 3. All panels must be installed and meet standards according to the NFPA 72 code manual.......... 4. The gas detection system is a separate system and not part of current requirement............. 5. Panels in the North Bay and South Bay report to the Main fire panel in middle.................. (Boiler room). Work is required on North Bay panels and Main panel only................. 6. Work will be scheduled and coordinated with maintenance schedule of aircraft, to be arranged after award................ 7. Both new Notifier panels require programming only. Programming of the existing Monaco transceiver should not be required...................... 8. The questions came up that ?If the cost to install an addressable fire alarm control is more cost effective than a conventional system would that be an acceptable offer?. The answer to this is the following. Any contractor has the right to submit an unsolicited proposal/quote (unsolicited, in this case, meaning it meets the ultimate requirement, however, deviating in the process). The only caution I would advise is that the customer has outlined what their requirement is and what they want to see in the quotes. If the proposal does not meet this requirement it could potentially be eliminated. My suggestions would be to submit two proposals in this case...................... 9.

<DESC>Sources Sought.  The National Weather Service (NWS), Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) seeks a source to provide an existing computational product enabling NWS Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) to produce hydrologic forecasts for small basins with fast response times.  The forecasts are to be linked to hydrologic conditions maintained at NWS River Forecast Centers (RFC).  The product is to have the following 10 salient characteristics: 1)provide basin response in the form of hydrographs, 2)handle hydrologic conditions for small basins with response times less than a day, 3)have automatic execution and threshold value alarms requiring minimal user interaction, 4) ensure hydrologic condition information from the RFC can be used, 5)provide the ability to model snowmelt, rainfall-runoff, the effect of small impoundments and simple river channel routing, 6)account for operational NWS forcing data such as missing values and data corrupted by measurement or transmission errors, 7)integrate data from collection networks, radar precipitation, Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts and temperature forecasts, 8)provide data viewing capabilities and an interactive map interface, 9)allow for easy updating of rating curves and changes to the data network, and 10)provide web-compatible products and flood inundation mapping. Vendors who believe that they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating they can meet the Government's requirements. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Affirmative written responses must be received by October 3, 2002. This is not a request for proposal but rather a vehicle for obtaining information. The Government will not incur any cost as a result of this announcement.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Renovation upgrade of lighting systems for U.S. Courthouse, Tallahassee, FL
<DESC>The General Services Administration Region 4 is providing a notice of intent to procure Construction Services using other than Full and Open Competition to the firm of Culpepper Construction Company, Inc. for the Courtroom lighting renovations project for the new U.S. Courthouse located in Tallahassee, FL.  Culpepper Construction was originally selected under Source Selection procedures to perform construction services for the new U.S. Courthouse under contract No. GS-04P-96-EXC-0033.  Construction services to be provided under this new contract include upgrades to the courtroom existing lighting including addition and replacement of lighting fixtures, repair of wall and ceiling surfaces to match existing, new and modified electrical wiring and electrical panels, system tie-in to dimmer panels, protection of existing finishes and furnishings and close coordination with the GSA and U.S. Courts.  The firm of Culpepper Construction Company is familiar with the new Tallahassee Courthouse having constructed the building.  Culpepper Construction Company possesses intricate knowledge of the new Courthouse?s architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical and plumbing building components and therefore is the best qualified and most knowledgeable firm available to perform this new work.  The expedited performance expected through their unique project knowledge and extensive documentation of current conditions would result in less risk and cost to the Federal Government.  The requirement to procure these additional services under full and open competition would result in a high cost risk to get to a level of knowledge that the present Construction contractor already has due to the experience he has already gained from working on systems for the new Courthouse.  Therefore, this procurement is planned as Other than Full and Open competition basis on the grounds that Culpepper Construction Company is the only practical firm that can provide these construction services that will save the Taxpayer a considerable amount of money.  The total estimated range of this action is approximately Six Hundred Thousand Dollars.  Firms who believe that they must question the government?s intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Thomas F. Waller, Contracting Officer, (404) 331-4634 or to his attention at GSA, Property Development Division (4PCB), Suite 2500, 401 West Peachtree St., NW, Atlanta, GA  30308.  Additional contact numbers are phone number (404) 331-4639, and fax number (404) 331-7063.  Any written comments are to be received by the Contracting Officer within 7 days of the publication of this notice.

<DESC>NOTE: This procurement is 100 percent set-aside for competition among small businesses.

Hispanic-Americans remain underrepresented in the Federal workforce.  President Bush, Executive Order 13171 and OPM's own Nine-Point plan obligate OPM to develop and execute programs which will improve the representation of Hispanics in the Federal workforce.  A college/university peer marketing program is an excellent means of educating the college market about the many opportunities available in Federal employment.  Such a program on campuses containing large numbers of Hispanic students would inform this target group generally of the opportunities that exist among all Federal agencies and the specific role OPM plays in making these opportunities known to the public through its USAJOBS and StudentJobs employment information systems.

Purpose

OPM-ES seeks to provide peer marketing on up to five campuses containing a large percentage of Hispanic students.  This program should accomplish the following:

- Publicize the Bush administration's commitment to improving Federal employment        opportunities for Hispanic Americans
- Create and promote awareness of the USAJOBS and StudentJobs automated employment information systems.
- Brand the Federal government as a desirable career choice for Hispanic students.
- Attract Hispanic college students to apply for Federal government positions.
- Provide insights to OPM on factors, which will encourage Hispanic students to consider careers in the Federal Government.

Scope

OPM is ready to initiate an education focused marketing approach to educate and attract Hispanic students on up to five college/university campuses with large Hispanic populations.  This approach allows students, via a curriculum-based peer marketing strategy, to brand Federal government employment opportunities to their peers and the local community.

Tasks/Requirements

The contractor shall:

Program Planning

Task 1 - Recommend to OPM a variety of colleges and universities that are eligible for and want to participate in this program and, following OPM's decision as to which schools will participate, and then secure participation agreements with up to five colleges/universities with large Hispanic student populations.

Task 2 - Develop an in-classroom, for credit, peer-marketing plan from creation to end, including evaluation on all participating campuses.

Task 3 - Design a customized Federal Government marketing curriculum that guides students in using academic theory to develop a marketing project geared to their peers.  This project should publicize the Bush administration's commitment to improving Federal employment opportunities for Hispanic Americans, enhance the image of the Federal government as an employer and increase the number of applicants from the target population.

Program-Implementation

Task 4 - Introduce the marketing plan and curriculum to OPM officials.

Task 5 - Conduct pre-program meetings with marketing professors to discuss the curriculum, timelines and strategies and facilitate program orientation to students.

Program Management

Task 6 - Review all student generated advertisements and publicity and forward to OPM prior to action

Task 7 - Deliver status reports to the OPM every six weeks until duration of the project.

Task 8 - Manage marketing students throughout the semester (guiding them to meet their objectives and adhering to timelines).

Period of Performance 

The contract period is a base year (2 academic semesters starting with the first semester following execution of the contract)

Deliverables

The contractor shall:

Program Planning

1.  Provide a copy of the participation agreements for all five colleges/universities to OPM representatives.

3.  Provide an electronic and hard copy of a customized, in-classroom curriculum, including collateral materials, to OPM representatives.

7.  Provide copy of status reports to OPM representatives every six weeks until the end of the project.

8.  Provide evidence to show how the marketing students were managed throughout the semester (guiding them to meet their objectives and adhering to timelines) to OPM representatives every six weeks until duration of the project.

Government Supplied Items

OPM will supply as determined appropriate or necessary and based on availability, certain marketing incentives items that "brand" the Federal Government to be distributed to students during Peer Marketing events

OPM will provide each participating college/university with marketing extension codes.
Hispanic students and/or others, who apply for Federal government positions as a result of the peer-marketing program, will indicate this marketing extension code in their job application.  OPM will use this information to conduct an analysis of applications resulting from the peer marketing campus programs.

Program Management

Students participating in the peer marketing program at the selected college/university campuses will interact with the contractor and perform or provide the following to the contractor in a manner deemed appropriate and acceptable with the time table to be established by the contractor:

- Develop, implement, and analyze a marketing recruitment program geared at recruiting their peers for the Federal Government, thereby increasing awareness and diverse interest in Federal Government career opportunities.

- Research target populations,

- Conduct pre and post peer marketing surveys to target populations to obtain statistical evidence of student awareness of career with the Federal Government.
