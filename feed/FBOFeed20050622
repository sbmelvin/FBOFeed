<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Division, Astrogeology Team (USGS) requires the services of an expert consultant in support of the USGS RObotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) lunar calibration program. The RObotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) is a USGS project to establish the Moon as a radiometric reference source for on-orbit calibration of remote sensing imaging instruments. The observatory facility, data reduction systems, and techniques for applying lunar calibration to spacecraft observations of the Moon were developed under a previous contract with NASA.  Continuation of the ROLO program is currently funded by NASA under the proposal "Long-term Consistent Calibration of EOS Reflectance Imaging Data Products Using the Moon" (EOS/03-0253-0629).  The Principal Investigator and Project Manager is Dr. Thomas Stone. The ROLO lunar calibration system involves the reduction of a large and unique dataset of lunar observations to calibrated images, the development of spectral irradiance and radiance models of the Moon, and the application of these models to the specific observation geometries of spacecraft in orbit around the Earth. The USGS requires outside expertise to help develop and refine these photometric models, and to assist with servicing the requests of NASA spacecraft instrument teams for lunar calibration.   The USGS intends to award a noncompetitive procurement to Dr. Hugh Kieffer of Celestial Reasonings, Carson City, NV IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  Dr. Kieffer is the leading expert in lunar calibration, has published extensively on the ROLO dataset and models and their application to spacecraft lunar observations, and is the only known person with the required knowledge in this technical area.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services may submit a capabilities statement to the contracting officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist; if no submissions are received, the Government will proceed with noncompetitive award without further notice.  This is NOT a Request for Quotations (RFQ); the Government does not anticipate issuing a written solicitation. This notice and any resulting contract or order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-04, effective 08 June 2005.  No numbered notes apply. For further information, please contact Jeff Caravelli, Contracting Officer, at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio requires a need to Develop and Extend a Biomathematical Model in Rats to  Describe Particle Size-Specific Clearance and Translocation of Inhaled Particles and Early Biological Responses.  The purpose of this RFQ is to develop an integrated and extended dosimetry model in rats to quantitatively describe the fate of, and biological responses to, inhaled particles by size and other particle characteristics.  This biologically-based mathematical model will go beyond existing models by integrating into a single modeling framework the following features:  particle size-specific processes of deposition, clearance, and retention of particles in the respiratory tract; translocation beyond the respiratory tract to other organs in the body, by particle characteristics (e.g., size and composition); and biological responses in the lung and other tissues.  

This integrated and extended model will provide a quantitative, scientific basis for extrapolating the exposure, dose, and response data in rats to humans for use in risk assessment.  The model structure will be developed based on validated biological principals and published data on the physiological and physical processes involved in the fate of inhaled particles of various characteristics (e.g., size and composition), as well as on data of the particle dose and biological responses.

Although models have been developed to describe the particle size-specific deposition in the respiratory tract, current models of the clearance and retention of particles are based on the mass transfer of all particles that deposit in a given region of the respiratory tract.  Among the respirable size particles, which are defined as those that deposit in the gas-exchange region of the lungs, the nanoparticles (<100 nm) have been observed to retard alveolar macrophage-mediated clearance to a greater extent than an equal mass or volume of larger particles (Renwick et al. 2001; Oberdörster et al. 1992; Morrow et al. 1991).  The surface area of particles was found to describe better the particle size effect on alveolar macrophage-mediated clearance (Tran et al. 1999).  Both the particle size and composition (or surface properties) appear to influence translocation rates from the lungs to the blood and other organs or tissues (Tran et al. 1999, 2001; Oberdörster et al. 2002; Kreyling et al. 2002).  Finally, nanoparticles depositing in the nasopharyngeal region may translocate to the brain (Oberdörster et al. 2004).  These clearance and translocation processes are not described in current lung dosimetry models; yet these processes may be critical determinants of the internal dose, and thus response, to inhaled nanoparticles.

This RFQ includes the tasks needed to develop a biomathematical model structure to describe the clearance, retention, and translocation of inhaled particles, by size and composition, with emphasis on nanoparticles.  The particle size-specific deposition in the rat lungs will be estimated using a published rat lung deposition models (e.g., Anjilvel and Asgharian 1995; CIIT and RIVM 2002), and these estimates will be input into the overall model.  The coefficients for clearance, retention, and translocation will be estimated from data in published rat studies (e.g., Oberdörster et al. 1992, 2002, 2004); Tanaka et al. 2001; Kreyling et al. 2002).  The calibrated model will be used to estimate the retained dose of nanoparticles in the lungs and other organs in ongoing NIOSH studies in rats.  When those NIOSH studies are completed (not part of this RFQ), the results will be used to evaluate the model predictions, and to further validate the model developed and calibrated in this RFQ.

Minimum Qualifications
	
1. Personnel Requirements:  

The successful awardee must have personnel with education, work experience, and publications in the areas of biologically-based mathematical and statistical modeling.  The principal investigator must have attained at least a doctoral degree in the areas of mathematics, statistics, or biostatistics; or in biological, health, or physical sciences with a demonstrable quantitative emphasis at the doctoral level.  All key personnel must have attained at least a bachelor degree in the areas of biological or physical sciences, mathematics, statistics, or engineering.  The principal investigator must have at least five years of work experience in biologically-based mathematical modeling.  All key personnel must have work experience for at least one year in jobs involving biologically-based mathematical and/or statistical modeling.  The principal investigator must have at least three scientific publications in which the methods involve the development of biologically-based mathematical models, and at least one of these publications must involve modeling the disposition of, and response to, inhaled particles in the lungs of rodents and/or humans.  

2. Methods requirements:

The successful awardee must demonstrate a thorough knowledge of the approach to be used in the conduct of this procurement.  The specific approach to be used should be described, along with a discussion of why the proposed approach will produce results which answer questions concerning the disposition of, and biological response to, inhaled particles (by size and other characteristics) in rodent lungs.  The relevance of using these modeling results in human health risk assessment should be described, including extrapolation of these models to humans.

If an offeror is interested in submitting a classified technical paper they must pre-coordinate with Mr. Reginald King at 310-416-1578 before submitting a technical paper.  The applicable NAICS code for this solicitation is 541710 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted; full and open competition is anticipated.  Prospective offerors are to submit annual representations and certifications via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Offerors can complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with the required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Specific Technical Paper Instructions:  (1) Cover letter.  A cover letter shall accompany each technical paper.  The cover letter should reference this BAA number.  It should also identify the technical area under which the paper is submitted, provide technical and contracting points of contact, CAGE code, and include statement indicating if the firm is a Small Business, a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business, an 8(a) Certified Business, a HUB Zone certified business, a Woman-Owned Business concern, a veteran-owned small business, or a service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  The cover letter must be signed and dated by an authorized official of the organization.  The technical paper shall include the following items.

(c) Program Plan:  Describe in detail the planned technical approach and how the approach will be executed.  (d) Rough Order of Magnitude Cost Estimate (ROM).  Page Limitations.  The technical papers shall be limited to 15 pages, single-spaced, 1-inch margins, double-sided, 8.5 by 11-inch pages.  Select an easy to read font no smaller than 12 pitch fixed or proportional font size 10 or larger.  Smaller type may be used in figures and tables as long as it is clearly legible.  The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.  Multiple technical papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  The purpose of the technical paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those technical papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission.  The Government reserves the right to enter negotiations on any, all, part, or none of the papers received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds.  The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offerors proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.    The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal,  (2) Importance to Space Control Technology programs, and (3) Affordability.  Price, in the context of affordability of proposals versus availability of funds, will be a substantial consideration in selecting proposals for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations. Price will be evaluated and negotiated on proposals selected for award.  No further evaluation criteria will be used. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.  Principle funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY06.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to a foreign disclosure review.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, SMC/SYK, Los Angeles AFB, CA:  Capt. Mia Kinsey, phone (310) 416-1728, email mia.kinsey@losangeles.af.mil or information if they contemplate responding. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. The work to be performed may require a TOP SECRET/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET/SCI information at time of award. BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Director of Staff, SMC/DS, phone number (310) 363-3571.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the contracting manager, Capt. Mia Kinsey (310) 416-1728.  This BAA will remain open for 12 months from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA, whichever is first.  There is no guarantee that awards will be made in each of the identified technical areas.  The Government may make multiple awards in a technical area depending, in part, on the cost of individual proposals and the available funding.  While technical papers will be accepted at any time during the fiscal year, proposals received later in the fiscal year have a greater risk of not being funded due to unavailability of funds.  Proposers are cautioned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to bind the government.

Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM 87185-5400 Description The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Service Center intends to award a sole source interim or "bridge" contract for a period of six months for security protective force services and other security-related services for the NNSA Nevada Site Office (NSO).  The services will be performed at the Nevada Test Site; Las Vegas, NV area NNSA/NSO facilities; contractor facilities; and other designated facilities.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented under FAR 6.302-1 (a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The interim contract is required pending completion of two competitive follow-on acquisitions:  a full and open competition for Security Protective Force Services (solicitation No. DE-RP52-05NA14390) and a small business set-aside for Security System Services (solicitation No. DE-RP52-05NA99344).  The present contract with Wackenhut Services, Inc. (WSI) will end on or about June 30, 2005.  No other firm has the requisite knowledge and experience to perform these highly specialized security services without interruption on July 1, 2005.  WSI has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security clearances.  This unique working environment necessitates the award of a sole source interim contract to the incumbent contractor, WSI.  The intent of this sole source procurement is to provide the required support services from July 1, 2005 until the award and transition of the follow-on acquisitions.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a sole source contract to Electric Boat Corporation (EB), 75 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT  06340, for the services required to staff and operate a Nuclear Regional Maintenance Department (NRMD) at SUBASE, New London.  The level-of-effort contract will require project management, engineering and planning, training, inspection and nuclear services to accomplish intermediate-level nuclear submarine maintenance, modernization and repairs in support of operational nuclear submarines including maintaining and modernizing facilities and equipment and providing off-hull support of submarine maintenance.  Work will be performed at the submarine base in New London, CT with occasional efforts at the company’s shipyard in Groton, CT.  The dynamics of submarine force operation requires an NRMD capable of meeting workload surges and shifting skill requirements on a daily basis.  This requires an NRMD contractor to be a nuclear qualifi! ed shipyard and to maintain a staff in close proximity to SUBASE, New London capable of rapidly providing the necessary mix of personnel.  Electric Boat Corporation is the only source with a nuclear qualified shipyard staff within the necessary proximity of SUBASE, New London capable of meeting the NRMD requirements.  Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact EB directly.  (See Note 22).

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has a requirement to conduct Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) of the Telemetry Buoy for the Underwater Communication System (TBUCS).  TBUCS was selected by the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, Advanced Systems and Concepts, Office of the Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics in FY 05 to be included in the FCT program.  This communications buoy is expected to facilitate communication between the Underwater Communication System (UCS) and surface and airborne platforms.  Due to the need to communicate among multi-national platforms, the system must use the Hydro--Acoustic Information Link (HAIL) System, to ensure interoperability.  NAVSEA has determined it is in the government's best interest to solicit this effort from Nautronix Maripro, Inc., 15222 Cook Place, Goleta, CA 93117.  This is expected to be a three-year effort.

<DESC>This is a synopsis being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the March 2005 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2001-27.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720 with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services on a sole source basis with David Serlin, 726 Sackett Street, Brooklyn, NY  11217, to provide a range of historical services in related to History of Medicine (HMD)/NLM symposia scheduled for Nobember 2-4, 2005. 

The “Global Health Histories” symposium is the third in a series of symposia sponsored by HMD/NLM as part of its outreach efforts.  These symposia serve as a valuable outreach tool for HMD as the Division promotes the research value, richness, and depth of  NLM's historical collections to a broad audience.  The presentation of material in the symposia, and the content and arrangement of material on accompanying Web sites, historical exhibits, and published proceedings, reflects the mission of HMD: chiefly that the "the Division promotes, conducts, and facilitates scholarly research and public education through seminars, lectures, exhibitions, film programs, Web sites, databases, publications, catalogues, and finding guides."

Dr. David Serlin's combined experience as a historian, educator, and symposium coordinator uniquely qualify him for this position.  He is an experienced historian, with a PhD in the history of medicine and American cultural history.  Dr. Serlin played a significant role in developing both the content and direction of the first two symposia in this series, “New Frontiers of Biomedical Research, 1945-1980” (2001) and “Visual Culture and Public Health” (2003).  In this capacity he researched a number of subject focuses; identified scholars to present their papers; remained in constant communication with speakers about their papers and presentations; laid logistical groundwork for the events (including Web casting, publicity, arrangements for food, and space reservations); and developed Web sites to provide overviews of the pertinent subject areas for potential attendees.  Dr. Serlin's fifteen years of experience as an educator, including professorships at Albright College, Bard College, and the University of California San Diego enabled him to fully reach this intended audience, which includes scholars, the general public, and graduate and undergraduate students, and to fulfill the Division's mission to "facilitate scholarly research and public education."

Dr. Serlin has been providing services to NLM in the Digital Manuscripts Program for six years, researching, writing, and updating narrative text for the History of Medicine Division's Profiles in Science Web site and planning and preparing the proceedings of two HMD-sponsored symposia for public distribution.  Through this experience, as well as his extensive background teaching graduate and undergraduate students, Dr. Serlin has demonstrated a broad understanding of the audience HMD desires to reach and the means of engaging them.  This is critical in developing an audience-appropriate symposium and accompanying Web sites and historical exhibits that try to reach a wide-range of users and educate them about the multitude of historical resources here at NLM.

HMD intends to sponsor such symposia on an annual or every-other-year basis.  They are hosted in the fall of a given year, and most of the planning occurs within the 4-5 months preceding the event.  Dr. Serlin's current position as a professor at the University of California San Diego allows for such a flexible schedule.  This flexibility, along with his skills as an educator, historian, and symposium coordinator uniquely qualify Dr. Serlin for the position of coordinating and preparing for the next symposium on "Global Health Histories" and working with NLM staff to develop plans for future symposia.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The technical proposal will receive paramount consideration over price or cost factors.  The evaluation will be based, in addition to price, on a written quotation detailing the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective vendor in relation to the needs of the project as stated below.  Offerors must submit a capability statement which demonstrate their ability to perform the task listed above or task of a similar nature.  Capability statements submitted in reference to this requirement will be evaluated based on the following information:  Criterion A:  (50 points) Demonstrated experience in planning and developing various historical symposia, including reviewing abstracts of submitted papers for presentation, recommending potential speakers, and laying the logistical groundwork; Criterion B:  (30 points) Vendor must have three to five (3-5) years of successful experience developing Web-based historical narratives or teaching tools, including online exhibits that highlight historical collections in effort to broaden audiences of users or work of a similar nature; Criterion C: (20 points)  Demonstrated experience in developing an educational Web sites and symposia to target and capture an audience at the undergraduate and /or graduate student level.

This requirement is for a base year with options for three (3) successive one-year period.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the continuation of the Aircraft Operations Systems Support (AOSS) services to provide real-time  operations for its legacy systems, software development, information technology services, implementation services of its current systems, aeronautical engineering design services and sustaining support to the Flight Crew Operations Directorate (FCOD), the Astronaut Office and Aircraft Operations Division flight operations systems at Ellington Field, Houston, Texas. In addition, there are responsibilities in the forward operating locations at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, Dryden Flight Research Center, California, and in El Paso, Texas. The effort  provides options to deploy and support the deliverables provided to other aircraft operations field centers across NASA in support of the Integrated Asset Management (IAM) Program.	 NASA/JSC intends to purchase the services from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The base period of performance of the contract will be from August 25, 2006 through August 24, 2009 with two 1-year options for extensions of services through August 24, 2011. The statutory authority for proceeding with this acquisition under Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as contemplated by the provision of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), which states that full and open competition need not be provided for when the services required by the Agency may be deemed to be available from one orginal source in the case of a follow-on contract, for the continued provision of highly specialized services.  The provision also states that this exception is applicable when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements.   The original JOFOC for the current AOSS was approved by the JSC Competition Advocate of July 16, 2001. This JOFOC determined that, pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), continued support by SAIC was essential to prevent a lapse in the real-time operations and sustaining support services to JSC.   SAIC has developed most of the existing legacy systems during the past eight years and acquired a unique level of expertise and corporate knowledge necessary to provide the required program support that is currently not available from any other source.  SAIC possesses an independent certification of the SEI CMMI (Capabilities Maturity Model – Integrated) Level 3 or better quality assurance standard, has the documentation, facilities, and the personnel expertise required for all areas of the AOSS requirement. These qualifications and resources are not available from any other company and have become even more specialized in a wide variety of areas since the the beginning of Fiscal Year 1998. The consistency provided by the developer of the software for these functions can only be provided by SAIC and this consistency is required by the Government to sustain these vital functions. The safety risk to the Government associated with transitioning a new contractor cannot be accepted at this time due to the criticality of the work effort. Because of these considerations, including the unacceptable costs and delays that would be incurred to conduct a competition and/or select a different contractor, the potential benefits from competition do not justify accepting these substantial risks for the FCOD. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26. See Note 22.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URL:	  http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for one each Variable Pressure Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope, in support of NASA Marshall Space Flight Center programs.	Materials and failure analysis at MSFC requires analyzing various categories of materials that include metallics, ceramics, composites, biologics and meteoritics.  To adequately analyze all categories of materials requires a high resolution electron microscope with a large stage movement and wide flexibility in low and high vacuum imaging capabilities. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the microscope in accordance with the attached minimum Government specifications, from FEI Company, Hillsboro, Oregon, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  FEI Company is the only known manufacturer of a variable pressure field emission scanning electron microscope that can deliver the required feature combination of large stage movement, large magnification range, high resolution, high variable pressure, and secondary and backscattered electron imaging in both high and low vacuum. 2.  FEI Company manufactures the only known Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope that can operate at a chamber vacuum pressure of 30 Torr (4000 Pa). 3.  FEI Company is the only known manufacturer of electron microscopes to include a gaseous analytical solid state backscattered electron detector.  Standard backscattered electron detectors lose signal strength at chamber pressures above 1 Torr (133 Pa).   4.  FEI Company is the only known manufacturer to provide separate low and high magnification environmental secondary electron detectors.  The axially-mounted high magnification detector provides significantly better image signal strength and resolution at high chamber pressures because of a short sample to detector gas path and integrated variable pumping aperture. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 1, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with the North Carolina Department of Environment & Natural Resources (NCDENR) for the design, development, and implementation of a sampling plan to determine the nutrient and pathogen content of runoff from the Lizzie Research Station, Farmville, NC during precipitation events during the next eighteen (18) months.  This work will complement bioaerosol sampling and microbiological analysis  that will be undertaken at the Lizzie Research site by the National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL).     Based on EPA's knowledge of the sampling of nutrient and pathogen content of runoff, the NCDENR has the only known site where groundwater well and stream gaging stations have been  installed on a stream that runs adjacent to a 5,000 head hog concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO).   Furthermore, the CAFO uses lagoon storage for manure from each of its five (5) 1,000 head hog confinement barns.  Excess manure is applied to cropland using a jet gun.  This combination of  manure management practices makes the NCDENR's site an ideal location of which EPA knows no other. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be  submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of  determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541990.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The original synopsis, published 16 June 2005, is modified to delete language regarding EW prototype development, fabrication and testing; and test set LRIP procurement.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division intends to negotiate and award a cost plus fixed fee IDIQ task order under Basic Ordering Agreement N68936-04-G-0005, using other than full and open competition.  Negotiations will be conducted with AAI Corporation, P. O. Box 126, Hunt Valley, MD 21030-0126, in order to procure engineering technical services for the development, testing and delivery of the software and hardware for use with the AN/USM-670 Joint Service Electronic Combat System Tester (JSECST) family of diagnostic support equipment to provide the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army and our Foreign Military Sales customers an Organizational-Level capability to test their onboard electronic warfare [EW] systems and related transmission lines- otherwise known as the EW Suite.  The aircraft pl! atforms supported by the JSECST program include the F/A-18A/B/C/D/E/F, AV-8B, EA-18G, EA-6B, E-2C, F-35, V-22, C-130, P-3C, Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA), MH-47, MH-60, H-60, and VH-60.  The primary role of the EW Suite is to enhance the survivability and mission effectiveness of tactical aircraft through situational awareness and countermeasures.  Each year brings new challenges to the EW suite in the form of new and/or modified threat weapon systems.  The EW Support Equipment Team is tasked with developing the EW Suite Diagnostics Systems.   This mission-oriented software requires updates on a regular basis as a result of the highly dynamic tactical and strategic environments.  Currently, the U.S. Navy is fielding, jointly with the U.S. Air Force, a new generation of EW diagnostics equipment centered on the AN/USM-670 JSECST.  Major task requirements to be accomplished include TPS Software Development; USM-670 JSECST Technical Support; and Integrated Logistics Supp! ort Technical Documentation.  As the designer and developer of the AN/USM-670 JSECST, AAI Corporation possesses the unique technical and engineering expertise as well as the technical data package for the JSECST, including data not delivered to the government.  The government anticipates awarding a 31 month task order to be awarded during February 2006.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm, other than AAI Corporation should respond in accordance with Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The following information is hereby incorporated, in its entirety, into the combined synopsis/solicitation and hereby replaces the Background  Investigations Clause identified in Amendment No. 0001, dated June 16,  2005:   BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS Clause.  In accordance with 25 U.S.C.  3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence  Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441  Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all  positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with  or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation  and determination of suitability for employment.  Accordingly, all such  positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability)  determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian  Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program;  and, a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the  Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  A favorable security clearance/  background investigation shall be made within 75 days after the effective  date of the contract award.  A favorable screening (applicant and  suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs  (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and  Suitability Program within 20 days after the effective date of the  contract award.  Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM,  the contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and  suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the  supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background  investigation (42 U.S.C. 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a  final background investigation determination has been made.  Prior  employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau  of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or  investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable  screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background  investigation.    It is solely the company, individual or contractor’s  responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability  Program at (505) 248-6938/6939/6940/6383 in order to obtain a complete  security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate  investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation;  and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and  subsequent final background investigation.   If an unfavorable screening  (applicant and suitability) determination is made for an individual, this  individual shall not be allowed to perform any work in accordance with the  terms and conditions of the contract.  The individual and or the company  who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be  non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability)  determination is made, which will make them ineligible for contract award.   If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made,  the contract may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be  authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the service involves  contact with or regular control over Indian children.   All other terms  and conditions shall remain in full force and effect.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD is seeking information for potential sources and no-cost product samples of commercially available spacer fabrics or meshes or narrows.  This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
Spacer fabric/meshes/narrows are sought to enable rapid inflation of garment bladders even under heavy compression, such as that from harnesses, load bearing straps, body folds, and seated weight. Air flow under 10.0 PSI compression should be at least 80% of the uncompressed airflow.  Spacer fabrics/meshes/narrows should be between 0.13 to 0.26 inches thick initially; 0.020 to 0.040 during 1-minute compressions of 10.0 pounds per square inch, and 0.10 to 0.23 inches thick after five compression cycles. A compression cycle shall consist of 1 minute of compression at 10.0 PSI and five minutes of recovery. Spacer fabric/meshes should have high air permeability with a minimum of 120 liters per minute.  High heat and flame resistance is desirable but not mandatory. The fabric/mesh/narrow should be dimensionally stable after home laundering (hot cycle) and during hot storage conditions. Hot storage conditions shall be simulated by exposing a 24 by 24 inch sample for 30 minutes at 200 degrees F + 5 deg F with 12 hours cooling time. After exposure, the fabric should have shrunk no more than 4.0% in the warp and 2.0% in the fill. Fabrics and meshes should be 45 inches wide and be able to be cut with sharp blades into 1.5-inch widths and maintain that width during routine cut/sew operations without unraveling more than 1/16 inch from each cut edge. Narrows should have a finished width of 1 to 1.5 inches.  Fabric/meshes/narrows should have soft edges that will not abrade or puncture the bladder fabric. Fabrics/meshes/narrows should be flexible, bendable, and pliable so that body movements are not limited.  


This announcement is neither a Request for Quote/Proposal, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information/items submitted in response to this synopsis.  Any qualified sources may be listed on Source Control Drawings for such items as military anti-G suits, ventilation garments, and life preservers. Product samples and related data are to be shipped to NAWCAD contracts office no later than 30 days after the post date of this synopsis.

Written responses should be submitted no later than 30 days after the date of this synopsis and reference this synopsis number on both the mailing envelope as well as on all enclosed documents. Interested sources shall state company size. Please address all technical questions to Wendy Todd, wendy.todd@navy.mil.  One-yard product samples and specification sheets will be required from all interested sources at no cost to the Government. Proprietary data MUST be marked on a page-by-page basis, and will be kept confidential and protected where so designated. Interested sources shall state whether their sample is available commercially, minimum yardage required for purchase, cost per yard and lead-time.  Data and samples WILL NOT be returned. This synopsis does not commit the Government to awarding a contract.  This synopsis is for market research only and any procurement resulting from this announcement will be published separately on the Federal Business Opportunities website.

Should new construction be proposed in response to this notice, the face of the building’s exterior, on all sides, shall not be less than 50 feet to the protected/defended perimeter.

6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 	two years

7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: 			USAID/Armenia/EREO	  				
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION:

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The USAID Mission in Yerevan has program responsibility for the formulation of the
Country strategy and implementation of a program designed to create a democratic society and market economy in Armenia. The Democracy and Social Reform Office (DSRO) is currently responsible for managing over 30 activities in these program areas, with an OYB of approximately $30 million annually.  DSRO staff currently consists of 2 USDHs, 6 USPSCs, and 6 FSNs.  The DSRO portfolio is large, complex and can be divided into four major components:
	1.  In democracy, USAID Armenia’s goal is increased participation in civic life and more open governance institutions through which to channel participation, in order to stimulate the demand side for improved governance and to hold government institutions accountable through the democratic process.
	2.  In healthcare, USAID Armenia programs focus on primary healthcare, and a well-functioning health system that ensures access to high quality services.  These factors are critical if Armenia is to break out of the vicious cycle of poverty, poor health, and low economic growth.
	3.  In social protection, USAID Armenia’s goal is an effective and sustainable benefits system, in addition to targeted vocational training.  Together, these are necessary to meet long-term universal coverage commitments for the disabled and the elderly, as well as the short-term needs of the unemployed and the poor.
	4.  In Nagorno-Karabakh (NK), USAID provides subsistence level humanitarian assistance to victims of the NK conflict based on the needs of these victims and in response to U.S. Congressional directives.  Humanitarian aid provided since 1998 is in the areas of shelter, health, drinking and irrigation water systems, de-mining and micro-loans to selected vulnerable population of NK.
	5.  For the cross-sectoral anti-corruption objective, the Mission has committed itself to integrating anti-corruption efforts and considerations into all of its programming in all sectors, along with a stand-alone activity to support civil society’s mobilization to combat corruption.

DSRO must, to varying degrees, coordinate each of these activities with a large group of multilateral donors.  These include the World Bank (WB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the European Union’s TACIS program.  In addition, there are several bilateral agencies working in Armenia, including Germany’s Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID), and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), among others.   

Political instability in the government and frequent changes in key counterparts complicate implementation of the DSRO portfolio.  Additionally, many key counterparts have been educated in the former Soviet system and have had little international experience or education.  A considerable amount of time must be devoted to re-educating them to Western standards.

The DG SO team includes one USDH, two USPSCs (GS 14), and 2 FSN PSCs (FSN 12 and 11).  Funding for USAID/Armenia’s DG activities totals approximately $8 million per year.  On a day-to-day basis, DSRO’s Civil Society Advisor (CSA) is responsible for designing, managing, implementing, coordinating, and monitoring all non-media components of the Mission’s civil society portfolio.  The CSA receives guidance from the Senior Democracy Advisor, DSRO Deputy Director, and DSRO Director, working independently and making judgments/decisions as specified in this SOW.  The incumbent will have the authority to negotiate on behalf of the Mission regarding the civil society portfolio.  The CSA serves as a key Mission spokesperson on matters related to civil society in Armenia.

<CONTACT>CATHY KALLISTROS, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3071
<DESC>The Army has a requirement to investigate the consolidation of tungsten and tungsten heavy alloys by Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP).  Of special interest is to quantify the densification rate of each alloy as a function of  temperature and pressure, and to identify the minimum temperature at which full densification will occur.  In order to minimize the number of required HIP runs and minimize the cost to the government, the capability of measuring  densification in real-time during HIP is required.  The maximum temperature during HIP is expected to be between 1000 Degrees Celcius and 1200 Degrees  Celsius.  The government shall supply all the powders.  The vendor shall fabricate HIP canisters; prepare powder blends, as specified by the government; fill, degas and seal the HIP canisters; perform instrumented HIP experiments with real-time monitoring of densification; and analyze the measurement data and provide the government with measurements of relative density,  densification rate and minimum temperature required for full densification of each alloy.  POC for this action is William Sharpe, 973-724-7144.  See Note 25

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information, Army Medical Department Wellness Program
<DESC>Background:  The United States Army operates medical treatment facilities throughout the United States and in several foreign countries.  These facilities treat not only active duty Soldiers but also their family members, and The Surgeon General (TSG ) is committed to providing the highest level of care possible, while controlling healthcare costs to the maximum extent possible.  Soldiers must always remain in peak, optimal physical condition to be able to respond to national crises at home and abroad .  Maintaining and promoting the health and welfare of military beneficiaries is a prime concern of TSG. Notional Concept:  To assist in meeting the needs described above, TSG envisions a  comprehensive wellness strategy to improve troop readiness, anticipate and avoid chronic health outcomes in both Soldiers and their family members, while simultaneously reducing the cost of health care.  This is envisioned as an automated system which can,  using readily available clinical data and personal/family history, accurately assess the individual risk for onset of chronic diseases/conditions.  The ultimate vision for such a system would be one which can accurately predict the time of onset of such d iseases.   In addition, this system would be capable of identifying preventable, lifestyle-related chronic illnesses, as well as cost-mitigation strategies that might be employed for managing these illnesses.  Army medical treatment facilities manage all p atient data electronically through the Composite Health Care System (CHCS).  Any operational system will have to be interface capable with DoD and Army Medical Department standard systems.  Any data manipulation must be in full compliance with HIPAA and th e privacy act. Responses:  No contract will be awarded as a result of this RFI.  The Government will not pay for costs associated with developing a response to this RFI.  No other information is available to respondents.  To be of greatest value, responses should be rece ived by 22 July 2005.  Electronic submissions are required.   	1.  Is the Governments objective achievable using currently available systems? 2.  Tell us about your organization and its capabilities to meet the objectives listed above.  Identify your organizations salient characteristics:  small or large business, minority or disadvantaged owned, if applicable, for profit or not for profit, uni versity or consortium, etc. 3.  Identify your organizations experience with respect to the objectives stated above.   4.  For any systems which you currently have, tell us how they are designed to interface with other automated systems.  Describe your companys focus on HIPAA compliance? 5.  Identify current or prospective partners and salient characteristics.

KEY DEPARTMENT AND PSC INITIATIVES, ON WHICH THE CONTRACTOR HAS PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE, ARE INTERRELATED AND CONTINUING, HOWEVER, MANY ARE SHORT TERM, MAKING IT DESIRABLE TO HIRE A KNOWLEDGEABLE, EXPERIENCED CONTRACTOR RATHER THAN ATTEMPT TO TRAIN AN EMPLOYEE OR EVEN AN INEXPERIENCED CONTRACTOR. ADDITIONS AND CHANGES WILL BE REQUIRED IN FUTURE STAGES AS PLANNING CONTINUES AND THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS REQUIRED IN THE PAST WILL BE EVEN MORE CRITICAL AS THESE ACTIVITIES CONTINUE, PERHAPS ON A MORE INTENSIVE BASIS.       

THE CONTRACTOR HAS EXTENSIVE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION, TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING AND MANAGING GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL. HE ALSO HAS A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF EXPERIENCE GAINED IN WELL OVER 20 YEARS WITH FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS IN THE PSC/HHS THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DUPLICATE.  

THE CONTRACTOR HAS A UNIQUE AND IRREPLACEABLE COMBINATION OF KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE (INCLUDING DIRECT WORKING EXPERIENCE WITH THE ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSES WHERE THIS WORK WILL BE PERFORMED) THAT ARE NEEDED FOR SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE.   

IN ADDITION, THE COST AND TIME REQUIRED TO EMPLOY AND TRAIN A DIFFERENT CONTRACTOR WOULD BE PROHIBITIVE, EVEN IF ONE WITH SIMILAR PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS COULD BE LOCATED.  

THE CONTRACTOR’S KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IN OPERATIONS, ORGANIZATION AND MANAGING PSC FINANCIAL SERVICES ARE UNIQUE BECAUSE THEY ARE PROGRAM SPECIFIC AND ALSO BECAUSE HE HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL ROLE IN DEFINING THEIR PRESENT FORM.     ACCORDINGLY, IT IS BY FAR TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT, USING EITHER COST MEASURES OR THE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL QUALITY REQUIREMENTS, TO SELECT THE CONTRACTOR AS THE SOLE PROVIDER FOR THE SERVICES REQUIRED.  

THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background

The Disaster Resources Unit (DRU), within the Field Support Team (FST) at the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), was created to assist with the transition of OFDA to rapid-response activities during a disaster.  In addition, the DRU manages OFDA’s dissemination of public donations information, OFDA’s role in the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination and International Search and Rescue systems, and staff safety and security.

Introduction

OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.

The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA’s capacity to execute and coordinate United States Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The Operations Division (OPS) consists of three teams; the Operations Support Team (OST), the Overseas Administration Team (OAT), and the Field Support Team (FST).

The OST provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue (SAR), Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, Consequence Management, overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and other sectors necessary to assure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The OAT provides administrative services to OFDA’s field offices.  The OAT also manages the Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) program, which provides rapid, surge capacity staffing.

The FST coordinates surge capacity staffing mechanisms and staff safety and security initiatives, manages an inter-agency agreement with the US Forest Service for surge capacity staffing and OFDA response system design, maintains and trains on disaster response systems such as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) and the Response Management Team (RMT), coordinates with other agencies in the USG and with some elements of the United Nations (UN), and coordinates the Public Donations Information and Outreach project.  

OBJECTIVE

The OFDA Safety and Security Coordinator will have primary responsibility for coordination of all safety and security-related activities of OFDA.  

STATEMENT OF WORK/DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

•	Continuously monitor security situations in countries and regions to which OFDA has, or may have, staff.
•	Provide general and country-specific security guidance to OFDA Senior Management and to individual OFDA staff as needed.
•	Coordinate periodic updates to OFDA’s security guidelines, plans, and templates.
•	Work with OFDA’s Training Unit to develop and periodically update security curriculum as needed, and identify third-party security training to recommend for OFDA staff.  
•	Maintain a cadre of qualified personnel able to deploy as OFDA Safety and Security Officers.
•	Work with the non-governmental organization (NGO) community and OFDA/DRM to investigate and undertake initiatives to increase NGO capacity to improve their overall security management. 
•	Support NGO and UN community efforts to pursue the development of a security incident reporting system for the humanitarian community, or the enhancement of such a system to the extent it already exists.  Recommend incorporation of associated technology into existing procedures and systems, such as geo-referenced data, GIS, and GPS applications for security functions in the field.
•	Coordinate and track the activities of other OFDA staff that relate to security.
•	Arrange critical-incident stress debriefings for OFDA staff as required, working with appropriate USAID offices.
•	Serve as Liaison to other USAID, USG, UN, and NGO offices on the issue of staff safety and security, in particular USAID’s Office of Security.  This includes participation in inter-agency security working groups as needed.  Forming relationships with other relevant organizations such as the European Community’s Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), United Nations Security Coordinator (UNSECOORD), Department of Defense (DOD), etc, in order to coordinate security standards and good practices, will be a key component of this position.
•	Serve on OFDA Response Management Teams (RMT) and Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DART) as Safety and Security Officer, as needed.

•	Represent the OFDA Director on safety and security matters.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.   The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.   Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.   Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C., 20593, Telephone:  202-267-2285

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

Submit Full Proposals in two (2) volumes; 

(1)	VOLUME I – TECHNICAL PROPOSAL, not to exceed thirty (30) pages, should include the following three sections: Section 1 - Executive Summary: Provide a brief technical and business description of the contents of the proposal. The technical area should address the proposal's technical goals, approach, and expected results. The business area should address business and/or commercial applications of the proposal technology. Section 2 - Technical Issues: Detail the technical approach, objectives, staffing and resources relating to the development of the proposed technology for military and commercial (if applicable) use; discuss specifically in realistic terms the technical objectives of this proposed effort; provide a Statement of Work (SOW) that discusses the specific tasks to be accomplished, tied to the specific approach and goals of the project; provide resumes for Principle Investigator(s) and other key research personnel; describe the current and planned facilities and equipment to accomplish the research objectives; and, give a description of past performance on similar efforts. Section 3 - Business Issues: Discuss the business issues relating to the commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market; detail benefits to the Department of Defense (DoD). 

(2)	VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, and should address funding periods of performance.  Formal work breakdown structures and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired, however, NAVAIR reserves the right the request this information for proposals using FAR/DFARS type contracts. Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order: 
Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of 
the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the Statement of Work and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see above); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing. Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors’ cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement. Present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made. Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements. 

NOTE: Proposals will not be accepted after the due date stated above. 

VI. EVALUATION CRITERIA. The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement.  The primary evaluation criteria are: 

(A)	Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and

(B)	Potential contributions to the Avionics Group, Electro-Optical, Radio-Frequency and Special Missions Sensors Division and UAV platform to include (1) relevance to the stated technology areas of interest; (2) anticipated operational military (or commercial, if applicable) utility; (3) ability of proposed system/study to be rapidly ready for field-testing; (4) suitability for inclusion in a warfighting experiment (results of a simulation/study may be suitable for inclusion, but a contractor proposing paper vice hardware, needs to specifically address this evaluation factor); and, (5) projected affordability of transitioning the technology to the fleet or a commercial activity (for any developed hardware).

Other evaluation criteria, of lesser importance than (A) and (B) but equal to each other, are:

(C)	The offeror’s capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research investigators/personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; and
(D)	The realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing. 

III. AWARDS.  NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated above (See para. II). All awards will be based on merit competition. The Government reserves the right to select all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations.  There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the contracting officer, and the total exceeds $500,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.

The following is a quote from their website answering the question of using other brand name equipment. The only equipment approved/tested for TAS is on the AIT equipment list. Your equipment might possibly work with TAS, but cannot be supported by SSG. If this equipment malfunctions, you will have to contact the product vendor for any trouble-shooting and will cost you valuable turn-around time.   The equipment the customer is requesting is from the AIT equipment listing. The HQ SSG Program Management Office states that the Zebra Z4M printer and Symbol P370 and 8146 XScale scanners are the only tested and approved items for the TAS program.  Additionally, these are the only products that HQ SSG PMO will provide technical support for should we encounter malfunctions.

Statement of Work  For Near Space Vehicle Platform Analysis The Space and Missile Defense Battle Lab (SMDBL) located in Colorado Springs has a requirement for Near Space Vehicle Platform analysis.  The Statement of Work (SOW) is as follows: Period of Performance: 120 Days after award of contract. The estimated POP begins 1 July 05 and runs until 31 October 05. Deliverables: Written Final Report submitted to the SMDBL no later than 120 days after execution of the purchase order (1 Nov. 05), plus oral presentations on progress to be scheduled approximately every 30 days, beginning 30 days (1 Aug. 05) after executi on of the purchase order. Technical tasks to be performed: 1. In conjunction with the SMDBL, candidate will select up to three near-space vehicle platform configurations for further analysis, either under this SOW, or under anticipated follow-on investigation. The three configurations shall be: #1 Cigar shape (sim ilar to the proposed High Altitude Airship (HAA), #2 Hybrid lifting, and #3 Powered (heavier than air). These configurations are intended to be generic representations of different classes of vehicles.  2. A preliminary analysis will be performed under this study of at least one of the chosen platform geometries, for the purpose of assessing the flight performance of the particular type (e.g., geometry) vehicle investigated. For the purpose of this study,  flight performance will be defined in terms of time on station at 65,000 ft altitude, or above, in the presence of winds and atmospheric turbulence. 3. To support the above performance assessments, the aerodynamic characteristics affecting this performance of the selected vehicle geometries will be estimated (also see Task 6 below). 4. Atmospheric data will be collected to support the performance analysis cited in Task 2 above. Data collection and compilation will be performed of existing atmospheric turbulence data and mean winds for altitudes above 65,000 feet, corresponding to up to three geographical locations to be selected by SMDBL. (This location(s) within CONUS) 5. A systems analysis of the available energy, and estimates of propulsive thrust or power available for the near-space vehicle geometries being analyzed would be performed in support of the performance assessment cited in Task 2 above. Factors to be consi dered would include propulsion efficiencies, payload energy requirements, environmental maintenance requirements, energy generation and storage rates and efficiencies, altitude and station-keeping specifications. 6. Where aerodynamic data (Task 3), atmospheric data (Task 4), and/or energy and propulsive efficiencies (Task 5) are available from SMDBL, that data will be evaluated by candidate and used as appropriate. No experimental efforts are anticipated under this  study for the generation of these data.  7. Based on the results of the investigations listed above, additional studies of particular importance or relevance will be identified and recommended. These additional studies might be undertaken as a follow-on to this study, or suggested as augmentation s to this study, performed in parallel. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Notice is No. AB133F-05-RP-1164.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 2001-27.  NOAA’S,  National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)) has a requirement for Satellite Dive Recorders (SDRs).  NMML conducts research on northern fur seals, a species listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).  The abundance of northern fur seals (callorhinus ursinus) on the Pribilof Islands in 2004 was estimated as being less than one-third the numbers born during the 1950’s prior to the beginning of the current population decline.  Because of the survival and health of northern fur seals is likely related to the quality of the habitat they occupy and use for foraging, reduced foraging success has been suggested as reason for the decline of northern fur seals. The instruments will be used to record individual seal behavior and transmit the data through the Argos satellite system (www.argosinc.com).  Delivery Schedule:  Quantity of 30 SDRs delivery required by September 15, 2005 and Quantity of 10 SDRs delivery required by October 15, 2005.  The instruments must meet the following specifications:  (1) The SDRs will be attached to northern fur seal pups and must be small to minimize the effects of the instruments on the animals.  Therefore, they must weigh less than 110 grams in air, and measure less than 85 mm (L) x 55 mm (W) x 25 mm (H).  (2) SDRs must have the capability of providing 60,000 transmissions at 0.5W radiated power. (3) To extend and control deployment length, the SDR must: (a) Include a wet/dry sensor that limits transmissions to when the tag is clear of the water; (b) Allow user programmable duty-cycling by day or month; (c) Allow user programmable limit of the total number of transmissions per day; (d) Allow user programmable limit of transmissions to hours when the satellite is likely to be in view; (e) Recognize whether the animal is at-sea or hauled-out, and transmit at the appropriate rates. Argos permits a maximum of one transmission every 45 seconds when the animal is at-sea, and one transmission every 90 seconds when the animal is hauled out; (f) Allow suspension of transmissions after the animal has hauled out for a user-defined number of hours. (4) The SDR must allow programmable collection of data on depth (1 m resolution), temperature, light levels, and wet/dry periods, and summarize them into compressed histograms for transmission through the Argos system.  The numbers of bins (up to 14 per histogram), the bin cut-points, the period of coverage (1-24 hours), and the starting time of each histogram must be user programmable. (5) The SDR must provide, at a minimum, the following types of data messages, selectable by the user: (a) Dive duration histograms: Number of dives within the specified dive duration ranges; (b) Maximum dive depth histograms: Number of dives whose maximum depth is within the specified depth ranges; (c) Time-at-depth histograms: Time spent within the specified depth ranges; (d) Time-at-temperature histograms: Time spent within the specified temperature range; (e) Percentage timelines: What percentage of the hour the tag was above a user-specified threshold depth, or dry; (f) 20-minute timelines: Each 24 hour period is divided into 20-minute increments. Each increment is marked with whether it was generally deeper than a configurable depth, or was dry; (g) Each timeline must be stored and transmitted for at least 4 days to ensure complete records are received through the Argos system.  Because the behavior of diving animals limits access to the Argos satellite system, the SDR must provide the option of condensing multiple data messages into a single transmission to increase data throughput.  Transmissions must include status messages at user-programmable intervals for battery voltage, the number of transmissions sent, the current zero-pressure offset value, the current time according to the internal clock, seawater conductivity, and maximum depth reading over the last 24 hours.  (6) The SDR must be potted in resin (preferably clear) to withstand pressure at depths up to 1000 m of water.  The potting must be cast in as hydrodynamic a form as possible, given the limitations imposed by the internal components, and be abraded on the bottom surface for adhesion to quick-setting epoxy, used to attach the SDR to a seal’s pelage.  (7) All user programming and control of the SDR must be provided through included software that runs under the Microsoft Windows XP operating system.  At least two sets of cables and other hardware required for programming/controlling the SDRs must be provided.  Windows-based software must be provided for user decoding of the Argos data into an easy-to-read format.  All SDRs are to be Shipped F.O.B Destination to:  National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115-6349 by the required delivery date.  
The proposals shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offers - Commercial Items.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation Criteria--Commercial Items: All offers who have manufactured and sold items similar to those listed above and meet the minimum characteristics listed above will have their proposal evaluated.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

According to the Government of Afghanistan, the current condition of the transport sector has deteriorated significantly over the past 20 years.  Only sixteen per cent of Afghanistan’s national road network is paved.  None of the country’s airports meet the International Civil Aviation Organization’s standards.  There are approximately fourteen vehicles per thousand people.  In urban areas there is not even one bus per thousand people. 

In order to address this lack of basic transportation infrastructure, the Government of Afghanistan (GOA) has developed a list of key investment priorities.  One top priority is the construction of 2,323 kilometers (km) of highways, including a ring road and connections to neighboring countries, and 4,484 km of provincial roads.  The ring road connecting the major cities of Afghanistan is already being constructed (with the Kabul-Kandahar portion already built) with funding by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Asian Development Bank.  

Another priority is the improvement of the civil aviation sector, primarily the upgrading of the Kabul airport to a full-fledged international airport and the upgrading of airports in Herat, Mazar-I- sharif, and Jalalabad to international standards.  In addition, Afghanistan needs to ensure it has an air traffic management system capable of handling increased international and domestic air traffic.  

Thirdly, the cargo and urban transport sectors will need to be improved.  Finally, construction of railway lines linking Afghanistan to neighboring countries’ rail networks is needed, promoting the flow of bulk goods into and out of Afghanistan.  In addition, dispatch and receiving stations at strategically important locations around the country will facilitate the efficient flow of these goods.

To implement these priorities, the GOA estimates that $7.5 billion in new spending is needed over the next seven years.  They have identified 47 individual transportation projects that require funding.  The following projects are an example of some that may warrant USTDA assistance:
§	Construction of four transport terminals in Kabul
§	Procurement and design of the Kabul city bus transportation system
§	Network of truck weighing/inspection stations
§	Corporatization and privatization of Government owned-companies, such as Ariana Airlines

The Minister of Transportation requested USTDA assistance during a meeting in April, especially for transportation projects for the city of Kabul.

The DM consultant would need to travel to Afghanistan in order to properly assess which, if any, of the above projects or other transportation projects meet USTDA criteria.  As part of its review process, the DM would contact other U.S. Government agencies, such as USAID, and international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.

<DESC>Solicitation #USTDA-05-Q-81-293 is hereby amended to include the following revised Section 2.4 and Section 6:

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to the host countries to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.   Please note that while this DM covers Romania and Macedonia, limited travel to Turkey will be required to evaluate one specific project in conjunction with Romania. The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Government of Macedonia (GOM) is in the process of liberalizing and privatizing its energy sector.  While the opportunities with the state-owned entity in Macedonia are limited until the GOM completes its restructuring and privatization plans, there are other opportunities in developing the private sector and developing alternative fuel sources.   Specifically, the GOM has been looking at ways to utilize waste from the agriculture sector, like rapeseeds, and converting it to bio-diesel fuel that can be sold on the European market.  The DM consultant would need to evaluate the following: (1) the amount of agriculture waste product available; (2) how much waste is required to produce bio-diesel to make the venture profitable; (3) the financial capability to build the facilities; and (4) where the facilities would be located.

The new Romanian Government elected in December 2004 is committed to continuing the progress and policies set forth by the previous government aimed at developing a market economy for the energy sector.  The government is maintaining a far-reaching economic reform program for the sector.  The reform package focuses on eliminating price controls, freeing the exchange rate, eliminating subsidies, allowing bank privatization, encouraging foreign investment, and speeding up industry restructuring and privatization to meet higher European Union (EU) regulations.  As a result of these reforms, several of the leading Romanian oil, gas and power generation and distribution companies have sought assistance from USTDA to comply with Romania’s new legislation and to prepare to meet EU standards.  

Romanian energy companies are eager to comply with the new regulations and are consistently striving to improve the efficiency of their operations to compete in the open energy market.  

The following proposals have been submitted to USTDA for funding consideration in Romania:
§	Environmental upgrade and emissions control equipment for the combined heat and power plant in Arad
§	Rehabilitation and modernization of a Combined Heat and Power Plant
§	Upgrade and pollution control equipment for a Thermal Power Plant
§	Installation of new gas turbines to improve efficiency and reduce emissions at the Iasi Thermal Power Plant
§	Submarine electricity transmission cable between Romania and Turkey
§	Hydropower pumped storage project
§	Ash and slag removal project for Termoelectrica’s coal-fired plant facilities

Due to the number and range of projects received, the DM consultant would need to be an energy expert with experience in: thermal power/cogeneration facilities; biomass to bio-fuel technologies; and EU environmental regulations for various power generation and transmission facilities.  The consultant also would need to be familiar with flue gas desulphurization (FGD) systems, as most thermal power facilities will require FGD systems to comply with EU environmental standards.  The DM consultant would pay particular attention to the potential effects on the environment for any of these proposed projects. The DM consultant would be required to travel to Romania, Macedonia and Turkey.  The travel to Turkey would be limited, and would be for the sole purpose of addressing the Submarine electricity transmission cable between Romania and Turkey project.
