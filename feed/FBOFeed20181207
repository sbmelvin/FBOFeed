<DESC>Naval Medical Research Unit - 6 is seeking to purchase 40 Aotus nancymaae for the development of an effective prophylactic to control Shigella, bacteria that causes diarrhea.  This development would offer a useful product for travelers and military personnel in endemic areas of Latin America, Africa and Asia. <br />An important requirement for pre-clinical evaluation of candidate Shigella prophylactics is the development of a reproducible animal model in which infection with Shigella induces disease mirroring that in humans. Prior investigations at NAMRU-6, have demonstrated that the new-world owl monkey (Aotus nancymaae) is an effective and robust model for Shigella diarrhea. <br />40 Aotus nancymaae individuals <br />These models mentioned above represent a unique asset to test the efficacy of vaccines targeting enteric diseases.  The delivered Aotus nancymaae animals must have an equal gender distribution (in so much as is possible) and be at 12 months of age and weighing over &gt;750 grams at the time of the initiation of the study.<br />If capable sources are not identified through this notice, then NAMRU 6 intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 13.106-1(b)(i) to Universidad Nacional Mayor San Marcos.<br />This pre-solicitation is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 5 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.<br />Capability statements are due by 12:00 PM Local Time, 21 December, 2018. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail only as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: genaro.m.vasquez.ln@@mail.mil. Please use subject line "BAC190047"

<DESC>THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: Rotary Coupler.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma has a requirement for overhaul and repair of Rotary Couplers for use in multiple radar systems.  NSNs to be repaired/overhauled include:

NSN 5985-01-394-3847    ARSR-2      Annual Demand:2
NSN 5985-01-394-3848    ARSR-1      Annual Demand:3
NSN 5985-01-394-3849    BOS         Annual Demand:3
NSN 5985-01-394-3850    FPS         Annual Demand:3
NSN 5985-01-547-2366    ARSR-4      Annual Demand:3
NSN 5985-01-313-7839    ASR-9         Annual Demand:8
NSN 5985-01-512-6662    ASR-11      Annual Demand:5
NSN 5985-01-363-3806    TDWR         Annual Demand:7
NSN 5985-01-319-8304    ASDE-3      Annual Demand:6

The rotary couplers are used in FAA radar systems and are critical to Air Traffic Control in maintaining safety in the National Airspace System (NAS).  The rotary coupler is a single point of failure for every radar system.  In the event of coupler failure, there are no back-up systems in place.  Therefore the quality and projected life cycle of the rotary couplers is vital to the continued support of the NAS.  

The requirement will be for one base year period with four one-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA.  It is anticipated that multiple contracts may be awarded to meet this requirement.

First article testing will be required for repair of each rotary coupler repaired by other than the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  First article test procedures will be set forth in the solicitation.

Results of repair/overhaul shall meet the standards specified in the FAA's Certificates of Compliance and Measurement Set documents for each rotary coupler. (See attachments to market survey.)  

Cobham Defense Electronic Systems, Kevlin Division is the OEM for the rotary couplers and holds the proprietary rights to the technical documentation.  Therefore, the FAA does not have any specifications or drawings available for release.    

The intent of this announcement is to permit companies that may possess the technical capabilities to repair/overhaul the Cobham rotary couplers an opportunity to provide specific information as to their unique capabilities as specified in this announcement.

CAPABILITY STATEMENT: 

Qualified vendors are invited to submit documentation evidencing the possession of the following capabilities:

1. Demonstration of experience involving manufacture, repair, and testing of rotary couplers of equal complexity or greater, including repair and testing of rotary couplers produced by other manufacturers.
2. Demonstration of possession of the proper National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable calibrated test equipment to verify compliance to the FAA's Certificates of Compliance and Measurement Set documents for each rotary coupler
3. Demonstration of the ability to manufacture or locate and obtain parts for repair
4. Demonstration of the capacity to handle the projected workload and return each unit to the FAA within 180 days after the receipt of an order
5. Demonstration of the capability to warranty each repaired rotary coupler for a period of five (5) years after installation in a radar site.

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR RESPONSE TO MARKET SURVEY:
In order to be considered responsive, organizations expressing interest in this matter must provide the following:
a. Capability Statement (as defined above)

Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA.

Interested parties who can comply with and meet all of the requirements called out in this market survey should respond with their documentation in writing to: Kevin Gramling, kevin.gramling@faa.gov.

Mark responses to this survey with Market Survey: Rotary Coupler Repair, to arrive by 2:00 p.m. CST, December 21, 2018.  

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Individual company responses will not be disclosed to other vendors.  This announcement is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.

<DESC><div>Synopsis</div>
<div>Using current machine learning methods, an artificial intelligence (AI) is trained on data, learns relationships in that data, and then is deployed to the world to operate on new data. For example, an AI can be trained on images of traffic signs, learn what stop signs and speed limit signs look like, and then be deployed as part an autonomous car. The problem is that an adversary that can disrupt the training pipeline can insert Trojan behaviors into the AI. For example, an AI learning to distinguish traffic signs can be given just a few additional examples of stop signs with yellow squares on them, each labeled "speed limit sign." If the AI were deployed in a self-driving car, an adversary could cause the car to run through the stop sign just by putting a sticky note on it (see figure below). The goal of the TrojAI program is to combat such Trojan attacks by inspecting AIs for Trojans.</div>
<p>This Draft Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is NOT a formal request for proposal. Proposals are NOT being requested or evaluated at this time. A Final BAA will be released at a later date for which interested parties may submit proposals.</p>
<p>The Intelligence Advance Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is seeking interested parties to thoroughly review the Draft BAA Funding Opportunity Description and provide comments, questions, suggested changes, and feedback by January 4, 2019 in the format provided below.</p>
<p>IARPA does not anticipate posting responses to any comments, questions, suggested changes, and/or feedback received; however, all input will be considered in developing the Final BAA. Additionally, the Draft BAA Funding Opportunity Description is subject to change in the development of the Final BAA as a result of IARPA's consideration of the input received from interested parties in response to the Draft BAA as well as other considerations.</p>

<RESPDATE>122118
<CONTACT>Miguel Diaz, Contracting Officer, Phone 2402765439, Email miguel.diaz@nih.gov
<DESC><div>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB), plans to procure a maintenance contract on a sole source basis from Varian Medical Systems, 2250 Newmarket Parkway, Suite 120 Marietta, GA  30067.  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide a service and preventative maintenance contract for a Government owned Varian Medical Systems TrueBeam radiotherapy system.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $20.5 million.  Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  It will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract with a 12-month period of performance.  It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI) requires a service contract to maintain, repair, and provide software updates for a Government-owned Varian TrueBeam radiotherapy treatment accelerator and its subsystems.  The accelerator is utilized to care for patients receiving radiotherapy as part of their cancer treatment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The ROB Varian TrueBeam radiotherapy treatment accelerator and associated components are used to treat cancer patients with radiation according to approved clinical protocols and to perform research to better understand the role of radiation in the treatment of cancer.  The Varian TrueBeam system is critical to patient treatment; therefore, any malfunctions with the equipment must be diagnosed and corrected quickly.  The accelerator must be calibrated accurately and maintained according to the manufacturer's specifications, because any deviation from the design specifications could result in patient harm and compromise the integrity of data for ongoing research studies.  Service outage due to equipment failure must be remedied promptly with emergency service to avoid harmful delays to patient treatment schedules.</div>
<div>A service contract will provide resources to answer user questions that may arise during clinical operations, service equipment on a quarterly basis as part of a preventative maintenance schedule and provide hardware and software upgrades as necessary to keep the equipment current in terms of functionality.  These services shall be performed by factory trained service engineers, either remotely or on-site depending on the nature of the issue.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Varian TrueBeam radiotherapy treatment system consists of the following components: TrueBeam accelerator base unit, SABR Extracranial Package, PerfectPitch Couch, High-Definition Multi-Leaf Collimator (hMLC), Megavoltage Imaging System (MV Imager), Kilovoltage Imaging System (KV Imager), Rapid Arc/VVMAT, Optical Imaging, SRS Intracranial Package, Advanced IGRT and Motion Package.</div>
<div></div>
<div>1.) ROB requires regular preventive maintenance service, which is vital to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the system.  Any deviation from regular operating parameters could result in inaccurate delivery of dose and/or location of the radiation treatment which would have a serious impact on patient care.  Regular maintenance will maximize equipment uptime reliability and reduce breakdowns which can disrupt patient treatment schedules.  2.) ROB requires emergency service for the TrueBeam system from factory-trained technicians available within 24 hours to return the equipment to service and prevent disruption of patient treatment schedules which can negatively impact patient care.  3.)  ROB requires technical and clinical support, providing phone, email, and web-based technical support for trouble-shooting problems as well as questions involving regular operation of the TrueBeam system.  4.)  ROB requires Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) replacement parts.  The TrueBeam is a newly designed system, and both the accelerator and associated components comprise a highly specialized and complicated system which integrate many Varian proprietary technologies.  5.)  ROB requires updates and upgrades to the software suite and operating system as they are released to ensure reliability and maximize uptime.</div>
<div>Varian Medical Systems is the only known company to maintain, repair, and provide software updates for a Government-owned Varian TrueBeam radiotherapy treatment accelerator and its subsystems as specified above.  Therefore, it is unavailable from other sources than the original manufacturer.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Responses must be received in the contracting office by 12:00 PM EST, on December 21, 2018.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst, NJ on behalf of the NAVAIR AIRWorks Program Office intends to issue additional delivery/task orders under Basic Ordering Agreement N68335-18-G-0014 on a sole source basis, with Leonardo Aircraft Division (LAD), Roma, Italy (CAGE A1512). The contract ordering period is estimated to be three years. The place of performance is the contractor's facility in Turin, Italy and at NACWAD Patuxent River, MD.
<p><br />The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD has been tasked by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to missionize the C-27J Spartan aircraft with nineteen (19) different sub-systems that include a Multi-Mode RADAR, Electro-Optical Infra-Red (EO/IR) High Definition turret, several other sensors (i.e. Direction Finding AIS) and communications equipment. This Mission Suite (MS) will be integrated by the United States Navy maritime mission processor capability, Minotaur, providing the USCG with their 3rd generation maritime patrol capability.<br /><br />This requirement is to procure the engineering technical data and services as well as hardware parts kits to modify, integrate prototype/install and test the HC-27J MS into the C-27J aircraft. It includes engineering technical data and services and hardware parts kits to establish the flightworthiness baseline for the aircraft, modify the current configuration to add the C-27J MS, support the NAWCAD-Aircraft Prototyping Division (APSD) in prototyping four (4) of fourteen (14) aircraft and verify the performance of the aircraft through flight testing. This effort will include data elements to support changes to the electrical, mechanical and structural configurations of the aircraft by providing engineering technical data and services.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst, NJ on behalf of the NAVAIR AIRWorks Program Office intends to issue additional delivery/task orders under Basic Ordering Agreement N68335-18-G-0014 on a sole source basis, with Leonardo Aircraft Division (LAD), Roma, Italy (CAGE A1512). The contract ordering period is estimated to be three years. The place of performance is the contractor's facility in Turin, Italy and at NACWAD Patuxent River, MD.
<p><br />The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD has been tasked by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to missionize the C-27J Spartan aircraft with nineteen (19) different sub-systems that include a Multi-Mode RADAR, Electro-Optical Infra-Red (EO/IR) High Definition turret, several other sensors (i.e. Direction Finding AIS) and communications equipment. This Mission Suite (MS) will be integrated by the United States Navy maritime mission processor capability, Minotaur, providing the USCG with their 3rd generation maritime patrol capability.<br /><br />This requirement is to procure the engineering technical data and services as well as hardware parts kits to modify, integrate prototype/install and test the HC-27J MS into the C-27J aircraft. It includes engineering technical data and services and hardware parts kits to establish the flightworthiness baseline for the aircraft, modify the current configuration to add the C-27J MS, support the NAWCAD-Aircraft Prototyping Division (APSD) in prototyping four (4) of fourteen (14) aircraft and verify the performance of the aircraft through flight testing. This effort will include data elements to support changes to the electrical, mechanical and structural configurations of the aircraft by providing engineering technical data and services. The data elements will require the use of the OEMs engineering analytical modeling, analysis, integration, installation and testing capability to provide reports that address all aspects of the MS modification. Government analysis of market research and the responses to RFI N68335-16-R-0223 concluded that only Leonardo Aircraft Division possesses the data, capabilities and resources necessary to execute all of the tasks identified in the RFI within the time frame required to meet the USCG requirements.</p>

9. DESCRIPTION 
a.	Background: 
Under the authority of Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or Super fund of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA); Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recover y Act (RCRA) and pursuant to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) (40 CFR Part 300); and in accordance with any reauthorizations or amendment s to any of the above named statutes and  new response legislation, the EPA has been delegated the responsibility to undertake response actions with respect to the release or threat of r el ease of, hazardous substances, or pollutants and contaminants, that pose an actual or potential threat to human health or welfare, or to the environment.
b.	Navajo Area Uranium Mines (USEPA Region 9) 
The Navajo Nation encompasses more than 27,000 square miles, spread amongst the Four Corners Region of the USA (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona). The unique geology of the region makes the Navajo Nation rich in uranium, a radioactive ore in high demand after the development of atomic power and weapons at the close of World War II in the 1940s. Approximately four million tons of uranium ore were extracted during mining operations within the Navajo Nation from 1944 to 1986. Many Navajo people worked the mines, often living and raising families in close proximity to the mines and mills. 
Uranium mining and milling activities no longer occur on Navajo lands, but the legacy of these activities remains, including more than 500 abandoned uranium mine claims with thousands of mine features such as pits, trenches, holes, etc., and homes and drinking water sources with elevated levels of uranium, radium and other radionuclides. Uranium and other elements (selenium, arsenic, etc.) associated with mine and mill sites also occur naturally at elevated levels in rock, soil, surface water, and groundwater across the Navajo Nation and the broader Four Corners region. 
USEPA maintains a strong partnership with the Navajo Nation and, since 1994, the USEPA Superfund Program has provided technical assistance and funding to assess potentially contaminated sites and develop a response. In August 2007, the USEPA Superfund Program compiled a Comprehensive Database and Atlas  of all known uranium mines on the Navajo Nation. 
In October 2007, at the request of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, EPA, along with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Indian Health Service (IHS) developed a coordinated https://www.epa.gov/navajo-nation-uranium-cleanup to address uranium contamination in consultation with Navajo Nation EPA. 



In January 2013, these federal agencies, in consultation with the Navajo Nation, completed a five-year effort to address uranium contamination in the Navajo Nation. The effort focused on the most imminent risks to people living on the Navajo Nation. While the last five years represent a significant start in addressing the legacy of uranium mining, much work remains and the same federal agencies have collaborated to issue a second https://www.epa.gov/navajo-nation-uranium-cleanup . The purpose of the second Five-Year Plan is to build on the work of the first plan, make adjustments based on information gained during this period, and plan the next steps in addressing the most significant risks to human health and the environment. 
Although the legacy of uranium mining is widespread and will take many years to address completely, the collaborative effort of USEPA, other federal agencies, and the Navajo Nation will bring an unprecedented level of support and protection for the people at risk from these sites. Much work remains to be done, and USEPA is committed to working with the Navajo Nation to remove the most immediate contamination risks and to find permanent solutions to the remaining contamination on Navajo lands. 
c.	Grants Mining District (USEPA Region 6) 
The Grants Mining District comprises an area of 100 miles by 25 miles that was the primary location of uranium extraction and production activities in New Mexico from the 1950s until late into the 20th century. The Grants Mining District extends along the southern margin of the San Juan basin in Cibola, McKinley, Sandoval, and Bernalillo counties as well as Tribal lands.
Three mining sub-6 districts located within the Grants Mining District-Ambrosia Lake, Laguna, and Marquez-contain 97 legacy uranium mines with recorded uranium ore production of over 52 million tons outside of the boundaries of the Navajo Nation. During the operational period, many of the larger mines conducted extensive dewatering to access ore below the water table. Most effluent from dewatering received little or no treatment before discharge to the ground or surface drainages during the majority of the mine operational period, causing perennial stream flows in major drainages. The extensive dewatering operations significantly changed areal hydrologic conditions, resulting in continuing influx of oxygenated ground water to areas that were dewatered during the mine operational period. Other environmental impacts may have been caused by erosion and leaching of mine waste materials, some of which were deposited into arroyos where it remains to the present-day, and by the reported operation of on-site heap-leach and stope-leaching operations. Few of the legacy uranium mine sites have undergone surface reclamation, and many have physical hazards that remain such as open adits and shafts, as well as uncontrolled waste rock and ore piles on-site.
d.	Both Regions 6 and 9
The primary hazardous substance on all the sites referenced in the requirements Statement of Work (SOW) is radiological mine and mine related waste; therefore, a significant knowledge base of radiological material handling, environmental data interpretation, and data collection will be required to perform the activities within this SOW. 
The terrain to access site locations is rough, water is scarce, and the weather is often extreme in most areas. The trails and/or roads to the sites are not improved or maintained. To reach the site locations, 4-wheel drive vehicles (capable of drives over rough dirt/rocky roads) and/or hiking long distances is required. Roads can become impassable in wet weather, and conditions can change quickly. 
In summer, the conditions are hot and dry; in winter, elevations make them subject to severe cold and high winds. Due to the quick changes in the weather, be aware of the danger of flash floods. While this danger is greatest during the summer monsoon season (July through September), flash floods can occur at any time of the year. 
e.	Purpose and Objectives: 
The purpose of the Navajo Area Abandoned Mines Response and Construction Services (AMRCS) contract is to provide cleanup, response, and construction services to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), primarily at former uranium mining-related sites on or within the Navajo Nation (within EPA Region 9 in Arizona and New Mexico) and within the Grants Mining District (located in EPA Region 6 New Mexico).

The selected contractor(s) will be required to comply with OSHA 1910.120(e)(3)(ii) for working on a site with known and characterized hazardous substances. A minimum of 40-hour HAZWOPER training for all contractor personnel working on site is required, and must be able to provide current certifications.

<SUBJECT>Fiscal Transfer Agent (FTA) Services for the SBA 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program - 2019
<SOLNBR>73351019C0009
<RESPDATE>012219
<CONTACT>Cheryl T. Flanagan, Contracting Officer, Phone 3038442035, Email Cheryl.Flanagan@sba.gov
<DESC>The Small Business Administration (SBA) has a requirement for professional support of the SBA 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program. Specifically, a contractor will serve as the Fiscal Transfer Agent (FTA), acting in a trustee, fiduciary, and custodial capacity for the secondary market for the SBA 7(a) Guaranteed Loan Program, along with related functions. The FTA will perform the tasks outlined in the Performance-Based Statement of Work (SOW).
<p>The FTA serves as the primary hub for the review and processing of SBA pool applications from approved SBA pool assemblers. The FTA, on behalf of the SBA, issues certificates representing interests in pools of SBA Guaranteed Interests. The FTA provides general administration of the Pools, which includes the processing of payments to Pool investors. This contract will provide all services related to the provision of SBA FTA functions for the secondary market program of the SBA 7(a) Guaranteed Loan Program. The contract will include services associated with the receipt, verification, collection, and transmission of loan data and program fee payments tied to 7(a) Loan Program.</p>
<p>The resulting contract will be a no-cost contract to the Government. For this contractual need, the Contractor is compensated by firm-fixed fees generated from the secondary market and loan activities, and with interest earned on funds held prior to transmission. The Contractor is not compensated with appropriated dollars. The estimated value generated to the Contractor per year for this effort is $40.0 million to $45.0 million, but will vary depending on overall loan and secondary market activity.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one contract with fully-loaded, firm-fixed fees (a percentage of the loans serviced in secondary market activity) will be awarded. The contract will use a non-commercial services format and clauses. It is estimated that performance will commence about May 1, 2019, and that the contract will be for a base year and six option years.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this solicitation is 523991, Trust, Fiduciary and Custody Activities. The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS is $38.5 million. The Product Service Code is R499. This Solicitation/Request for Proposals (RFPs) is being competed full and open. There are no set-aside provisions for this RFP. Interested contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov for NAICS code 523991 in order to be eligible for award. Interested contractors must also complete the annual representations and certifications electronically on the SAM website.</p>
<p>The Solicitation will be a Request for Proposals (RFPs) and will be issued on or about December 21, 2018, with written, paper responses due from contractors no later than 3:00 p.m., Mountain Time, January 22, 2019.

<RESPDATE>122618
<CONTACT>Jerald H. Neveleff, Contracting Officer, Phone 2024185345, Email jneveleff@cftc.gov
<DESC>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) intends to award a contract to The Bureau of National Affairs (BNA) on a sole source basis for access to their proprietary online legal research and data services. The contract will be for a base period of one year, with four, one-year options to extend the period of performance. The BNA contract will include access to law information including but not be limited to: Bloomberg Law, E-Discovery &amp; Legal Tech News; Bloomberg Law, Mergers &amp; Antitrust Law News; Bloomberg Law, Privacy &amp; Data Security; Bloomberg Law, Securities Law News; Financial Accounting; and, United States Law Week. Without access to the unique and proprietary online legal information from BNA, CFTC's attorneys would be forced to rely on reports and stories from the news media for non- detailed reports of events and opinions on developments in subjects pertinent to the operations of the CFTC. Not having detailed information and analysis on developments in these subjects would limit the ability of CFTC's attorneys to provide legal guidance or make judgements on appropriate actions. Furthermore, not having access to Financial Accounting would limit CFTC auditors' and accountants' ability to conduct research on accounting issues the CFTC deals with on a daily basis.
<p>This procurement action is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as the information required by CFTC is available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy CFTC's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers and, as such, no solicitation is available. However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the response date and time identified in this synopsis. Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement. Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source contract described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of CFTC.</p>

<p>Elsworth Dory<br />6101 Marlin Lane<br />Camp Springs, MD 20748</p>
<p>Mr. Elsworth Dory is uniquely qualified to do this work. Formerly, Mr. Dory held the position of Investigator, Narcotic Treatment Program Team, in the Division of Scientific Investigations, Food and Drug Administration (FDA). He works with large Governmental, private and corporate organizations, Federal, and State decision makers and consortia of community treatment programs and agencies. He helps to plan, evaluate, implement and/or improve the delivery of treatment services. Since 1972, his projects have ranged from assisting over 1,000 corporate clients to design, and implement treatment program plans to establish and maintain treatment facilities according to and in compliance with The Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974.</p>
<p>During his time at the FDA, Mr. Dory was responsible for all of the activities of the team responsible for assuring treatment program compliance. Mr. Dory is recognized as a primary authority on OTPs and opioid treatment by State and Federal agencies.</p>
<p>Trained in both investigative and compliance methods, Mr. Dory has taught the first and every update of courses on compliance with the FDA Narcotic Addict Treatment Act Regulations. He has been a member of the Interagency Narcotics Treatment Policy Review Board and as such is a key resource to Federal Agencies: including SAMHSA, CDC, DVA, DEA, NIDA, ONDCP, DHHS, and FDA. He is a National expert in exception and investigational techniques with intensive knowledge of monitoring OTPs to ensure their compliance Federal and State narcotic regulations.

<p>As lead member of the Narcotic Treatment Program Team, Mr. Dory has routinely guided the team through a myriad of functions to include: (1) review and approval of methadone maintenance, LAAM outpatient and hospital treatment program applications; (2) review and approval of patient exception requests and program updates; (3) maintenance of the National Directory of Approved Narcotic Treatment Programs; (4) Liaison with the Drug Enforcement Agency and State/local narcotic treatment program officials; and (5) enforcement activities, including review of inspection reports, issuance of warning letters, and taking action to withdraw treatment program approval.</p>
<p>Mr. Dory is available to do this work immediately. For all of the above reasons, Mr. Dory is uniquely and exceptionally qualified for this project. There are no other individuals or firms possessing Mr. Dory's unique experience of more than thirty-three years consulting with corporations and Government Agencies on the provision of Narcotic Treatment services, and his experience within government developing and evaluating narcotic treatment compliance programs make him uniquely ideal for this project.</p>

<CONTACT>Karen D. Scott, Contract Specialist, Phone 9165577109, Email Karen.Scott@usace.army.mil
<DESC>High water levels in early 2017 damaged levees throughout California's Central Valley. The Corps of Engineers will be repairing damages at several of these locations in 2018. Five of these sites are located within the San Joaquin County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (SJCFCWCD) near Stockton, CA. There are four interconnected levee sites. The types of services that may be required to perform this repair include Hydraulic Erosion Repair, sheet pile wall installation, and levee construction. The period of performance is 204 days and the estimated dollar value is $1M-$5M.
<p>Hydraulic Erosion Repair<br />Repairing hydraulic erosion sites typically consists of importing large (18-inch +/-) rock and soil, and placing rock and soil-filled rock to restore the levee profile. Rock placement will typically extend below the water surface while soil-filled rock will be above the water surface. A geotextile is typically installed at the interface between the rock and soil-filled rock. A layer of aggregate base may be installed above the soil-filled rock. When repairs are complete portions of the site may be reseeded, any damage to haul routes will be repaired, and the surface material of the levee crown will be reestablished, if needed. Depending on the location and configuration of the site, the materials may be transported to the site and work performed from land or waterside work may be required. <br />Hydraulic erosion repairs may be necessary at two or more of the locations. The scope of these repairs involve sites ranging from approximately 100 to 600 feet in length and involve estimated volumes of imported rock and soil ranging from approximately 1000 to 6000 cubic yards.</p>
<p>Sheet Pile Wall Installation<br />Sheet pile walls may be installed at one site to address levee stability concerns. Sheet pile walls may be placed through different portions of the levee and to varying depths. It may be necessary to partially degrade the levee before installing the sheet piles. In these cases the degraded levee must be restored after the sheet piles are installed. Sheet pile installation requires specialized equipment to drive the interlocking piles to the required depth. When repairs are complete portions the site may be reseeded, any damage to haul routes will be repaired, and the surface material of the levee crown will be reestablished, where necessary. If required, sheet pile wall installation may need to be done from either the landside or from the water. <br />If required, sheet pile installation is may be necessary at one to two locations. The installations would be approximately 200 to 300 feet long and extend to a depth of approximately 50 feet or more.</p>
<p>Levee Construction<br />Installing a new or adjacent levee consists of stripping a portion of the existing soil surface, proper disposal of the stripped material, importing soil with appropriate geotechnical properties, and properly placing/compacting the new soil to establish the design configuration of the new levee. New levees will connect to existing levees at each end and adjacent levees may abut existing levees. The existing levees will be partially degraded at these locations to allow the old and new levee materials to properly tie in to one another. When levee construction is complete the site will be reseeded, any damage to haul routes will be repaired, and an appropriate driving surface will be established on the levee crown. Levee construction will typically be completed from the land.<br />If required, levee construction is projected to be necessary at one location approximately 300 feet long.</p>
<p>In accordance with the FAR 36.204, the magnitude disclosure of this construction project is between $1m and $5m. This proposed contract action will be conducted using FSC Code: Y1LC, Construction of Tunnels and Subsurface Structures and North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS): 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction and the small business size standard is $36.5 million. <br />The RFP is estimated to be issued on or about Mid-December 2018 with proposals due tentatively in Mid-January 19. The RFP will be issued on the Government Point of Entry known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) and will establish a firm proposal due date/time. <br />The site visit date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation.</p>
<p>BE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE PRE-SOLICITATION, SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS.</p>
<p>The only PLAN-HOLDER'S/BIDDER'S LIST now available is via FedBizOpps.

<DESC>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby soliciting information under this Request for Information (RFI) to determine whether or not there are interested and available vendor sources capable of meeting the identified requirements. This document is for information and planning purposes only and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.
<p>The Financial Support Services contract provides support in the areas of administrative management, resources management, financial management, program analysis and business integration, business systems support services, special financial analysis, and contractor travel/training. While the majority of work is directly in support of Ames Research Center, other NASA Entities may be supported as directed by the Contracting Officer (CO) via Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Orders.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Ames Research Center (ARC), also referred to as the "Center" in this document, is one of 10 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) field Centers. With over $3.0 billion in capital equipment, over 2,500 onsite employees and a $800+ million annual budget, the Center's economic impact is significant, both regionally and nationally. ARC plays a critical role in virtually all NASA aeronautical and space exploration endeavors, conducting the research and developing technologies that enable NASA missions, fuel American markets for goods and services and enhance the quality of life on earth. ARC serves as a leader in information technology research with a focus on supercomputing, networking and intelligent systems. The Center also has strong expertise and facilities in support of fundamental space biology, biotechnology, aerospace and thermal protection systems, small satellite missions, nanotechnology, simulation and modeling, wind tunnel, air traffic management and human factors research.</p>
<p>NASA is implementing an Agency-wide initiative called the Mission Support Future Architecture Program (MAP) to explore methods of standardizing activities across the 10 NASA field Centers to generate cost savings.  To accomplish this, the Agency's Safety, Security &amp; Mission Success account, in which the Agency and Center Chief Financial Officer Operations account resides, are being grouped into Portfolios of similar work.  Each portfolio lead will be responsible for providing Agency-wide services for their portfolio including the necessary contract support. The Ames CFO has been formally assigned Agency responsibility for the End User Services Portfolio, which includes Travel (Including the Agency's Travel Champion Role and West Coast Regional Travel Office), Conferences and Payroll/Labor components.    Hence, while this contract is for the entire suite of financial management services at Ames, it will also include a component that will allow for the provision of agency wide services for the End User Services Portfolio and other OCFO Portfolios if required in the future.   Should Agency-wide services be required for other OCFO portfolios, the contractor will be issued a separate task order and such task order will be negotiated accordingly using local labor rates.</p>
<p>This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the requirements for the Financial Support Services for ARC and other NASA Entities. The contractor shall be responsible for the execution of the Financial Support Services performance requirements defined in this SOW.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The Financial Support Services contract provides support in the areas of administrative management, resources management, financial management, program analysis and business integration, end user services support, special financial analysis, and contractor travel/training. While the majority of work is directly in support of ARC, other NASA Centers may be supported as directed by the Contracting Officer (CO) via Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Orders. The contractor shall, except as otherwise specified, furnish all personnel, and management necessary to perform the following major categories of work:</p>
<p>&bull;	Contract Management: Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Core &amp; IDIQ requirement, further defined below<br />&bull;	Resources Management: IDIQ <br />&bull;	Financial Management: IDIQ<br />&bull;	Program Analysis and Business Integration: IDIQ<br />&bull;	End User Service Support: Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Core &amp; IDIQ  <br />&bull;	Special Financial Analysis: IDIQ<br />&bull;	Contractor Travel/Training: T&amp;M IDIQ<br />The Period of Performance anticipated to be from 1/14/2020 to 1/13/2025 and includes a 45 day Phase-In period.</p>
<p>This contract has requirements that are fixed and are identified as Core requirements for the period of performance. The contractor is required to ensure the Core requirements are performed throughout the life of the contract.</p>

<p>Place of Performance:<br />The services will be performed in the Health Services Departments at FCI Morgantown.</p>
<p>Schedule:<br />The contractor must be available to provide at least 416 sessions per year. A session is defined as one hour and will include service to approximately two patients per session. Scheduled service will generally be in blocks of at least eight sessions. Clinics will typically be scheduled between the hours of 7:30 am to 4:00 (excluding a thirty minute unpaid lunch break) Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Holidays. The scheduled days and hours will be mutually agreed upon by the FCI Morgantown and the contractor after contract award.</p>

Service will be on an as needed basis. The contractor is subject to call for emergency services from FCI Morgantown.<br /><br />Due to the nature of the correctional setting, delays in performance of work may be expected. Such delays must include but are not limited to inclement weather, electrical or mechanical problems, or other security matters. When contract employees report to the institution but are unable to perform services due to such delays, the contractor will be paid for one (1) session. Normally, any remaining sessions scheduled that day will be suspended and the contractor will be free to leave and the contractor will not be paid for remaining unperformed sessions. However, if the institution requests that the contractor remain at the institution for eventual performance, the contractor shall be paid for such sessions.</p>
<p>Supplies:<br />Due to security reasons, all supplies and equipment that the contractor may needed to perform the required services will be furnished by the FCI Morgantown. All records maintained by the contractor under this contract will remain the property of FCI Morgantown.</p>
<p>Description of Responsibilities:<br />The contractor shall provide, on a non-discriminatory basis, routine refractions, eye examinations, and tonometry examinations. He/she will provide documentation on all inmates examined and prescribe and make adjustments on eye wear, and will provide referral services to the Clinical Director for eye pathologies. The contractor will not be responsible for prescribing medications to inmate patients. In case of an eye emergency, the contractor will be required to see the inmate patient either at the institution or at their office for the examination. The contractor will be required to document examinations using the BOP's Electronic Medical Record (BEMR) and will be instructed in appropriate use of the computer system and BEMR.</p>
<p>The contractor shall inform the Clinical Director through BEMR of any recommendations for referral to other consultants (ophthalmologist, retinal specialist). Upon request, the contractor shall evaluate inmate patients who report to the institution with contact lenses for appropriateness of continued wear according to treatment guidelines. In the event that a patient meets the BOP's criteria (i.e. severe myopia and keratoconus), the contractor shall inform the Clinical Director through BEMR of the need of continued wear. In the event, that a patient requires fitting for specialty contacts, the contact lenses will be provided by another optometric service from the community.</p>
<p>Qualifications:<br />The contractor must be a graduate of an accredited university with a degree in Optometry. The contractor must be board certified with an unrestricted license to in any U.S. state or U.S. territory. The contractor must have no report of findings in the National Practitioner Data Bank.</p>
<p>Inmate Management:<br />The provision of services under this proposed contract will require frequent and unsupervised contact with inmates. The contractor will not be responsible for the management of inmates except to ensure that those inmates involved in activities within the contractor's scope of work shall abide by all rules in effect to ensure the safety and well-being of all participants. The contractor will report any infractions of rules and regulations by any inmate to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), or designee.</p>
<p>Institution Security:<br />All contract personnel providing services within the confines of the FCI Morgantown shall have a complete background investigation conducted in accordance with BOP Program Statement 3000.03. See also Section 2.3 of this solicitation entitled "Contract Security/Investigation Requirements".</p>
<p>The contractor agrees to adhere to all regulations prescribed by the institutions in regards to the safety, custody, and conduct of inmates. The Bureau of Prisons requires all non-employees to sign in and out of the institution for security reasons. Contractors will be required to attend a one-time orientation program, consisting of approximately four (4) hours, prior to performing any services under this contract. Additionally, a "refresher" orientation must be completed annually. The date and time for this orientation will be mutually agreed upon by both parties and reimbursement for attendance will be at the pro-rated contract session rate.</p>
<p>Method of Performance:<br />The contractor has sole responsibility and discretion for choosing and implementing the manner and method of performing tasks outlined in this Statement of Work as long as the requirements are met in accordance with the policies described above.</p>
<p>The services, although not directly supervised, shall be reviews by institution medical staff to ensure contract compliance. The contractor's performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Part 42. Contact monitoring reports will be prepared by the COR and maintained in the contract file. In this evaluation, if the performance of the individual instructors is deemed unacceptable, that optometrist will no longer perform those duties. In that event, the contractor will be responsible for replacing the Optometrist.</p>
<p>Payment Terms:<br />The contractor shall provide a monthly billing statement to the FCI Morgantown Accounting Department which accurately reflects days worked, number of sessions, and the total amount due for the previous month's services.</p>

<p>If the contractor is a self-employed individual he/she must provide a means of electronic payment to include bank routing and account number.</p>
<p>If the resulting contract is made to an individual(s), the provision of these services has been determined to meet certain criteria for creating common law employee relationship. Therefore, the BOP is responsible for the payment of FICA taxes (7.65%) and the withholding of the individual's taxes. These responsibilities apply only when award of this solicitation is made to an individual. It does not apply to companies or individuals who are incorporated. For evaluation purposes, an additional 7.65% will be added to the price submitted by individuals who are not incorporated.</p>
<p>In order to ensure proper preparation of their bi-weekly payment voucher, all hours worked must be documented by the contractor, showing the hours worked during each visit. Documentation will be provided on a "Log of Consultants Visit" form with each entry being signed by the Contractor.</p>

<DESC>Partnership Opportunity Document (POD) For NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Spacecraft Flight Systems for the Solar-Terrestrial Observer for Reconnection in the Magnetosphere (STORM) Mission for the 2019 Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Heliophysics Announcement of Opportunity (AO) dated December 2018
<p>1.0 Introduction and Scope</p>
<p>NASA's GSFC is considering the Solar-Terrestrial Observer for Reconnection in the Magnetosphere (STORM) mission proposal for the upcoming Heliophysics MIDEX Announcement of Opportunity (AO). GSFC is seeking partners for spacecraft and major subsystems for this potential science mission proposal. The STORM mission is designed to meet the science goals of the MIDEX program (those outlined in the latest National Research Council Decadal Survey for Heliophysics) by observing solar wind - Earth magnetosphere interactions on a global scale to define the overall roles of reconnection and particle acceleration.</p>
<p>STORM will be a single-spacecraft, self-standing, mission, capable of taking in-situ measurements of the solar wind magnetic field and plasma input into the Earth's magnetosphere from a high-inclination circular orbit with a radius of ~30 Earth radii. STORM will also carry a package of four nadir- or near-nadir pointing wide field-of-view imagers capable of detecting the global response of plasma structures (and their boundaries) that define the Earth's magnetosphere, including the plasmasphere, ring current, magnetosheath, and auroral oval. STORM will operate for a minimum of two years, offering perspectives on the magnetosphere from a wide variety of vantage points.</p>
<p>The GSFC STORM mission team will be submitting a proposal to the Heliophysics MIDEX AO currently planned for release early in CY19. The AO will specify whether it is a single-step or multi-step process, with the initial response being focused on the scientific merit and technical feasibility of the proposed mission and its associated scientific investigation as well as the entire end-to-end mission life cycle concept, with great attention to engineering implementation, cost, and schedule. A down selection may occur and NASA may choose several proposed mission concepts to continue for further Phase A definition culminating in a Concept Study Report (CSR). After reviewing all submitted CSR's, NASA will confirm one mission to continue on to the Implementation Phases B, C and D.</p>
<p>The following schedule should be used as a basis for responses to this opportunity:<br />Partnership Opportunity Document released December 7, 2018<br />Notice of Interest due December 14, 2018<br />Responses due January 2, 2019<br />Possible Response Presentation and Q&amp;A January 7,8 2019<br />Partner Selection announced on or about Jan 21, 2019<br />Helio MIDEX Draft AO Released ~early 2019<br />Helio MIDEX AO Released ~spring 2019 <br />Proposal submittal in response to MIDEX AO ~summer 2019 <br />Phase A Selection(s) Announced ~late 2019 <br />Concept Study Reports due ~late 2020 <br />Selection(s) Announced ~2021 <br />Launch Readiness date ~2025</p>
<p>The dates above are estimates based on current expectations for the AO release timeline and prior MIDEX mission proposal guidelines. More precise dates should be available in the Draft AO.</p>
<p>This partnership opportunity is being issued to select partners to team with the GSFC's STORM mission concept team for proposal submittal; to assist in the Phase A concept studies if the mission is selected; and to provide a flight-qualified system should the mission be selected for flight by NASA Headquarters. For the portion of this partnership opportunity dealing with the preparation of the initial STORM proposal, there will be no exchange of funds between the teaming partners. Funding may be available for Phase A and subsequent phases should the mission be competitively selected for those phases. GSFC reserves the option to not select any teaming partners under this POD offering on the basis of materials received.</p>
<p>2.0 Mission Overview</p>
<p>The mission cost cap for the Heliophysics MIDEX AO is not known at this time but may likely be in the range of ~$200M - $250M (FY19), not including launch, so cost is an important driver for the conceptual mission designs. The STORM mission will orbit the Earth in a 30 RE circular orbit (~190,000 km) with an 80-90 degree inclination to the ecliptic plane and will simultaneously measure solar wind conditions while imaging the global magnetosphere from polar to equatorial locations, addressing key science goals identified in the latest NRC Decadal Survey for Heliophysics. The STORM science payload will consist of 6 instrument packages: 2 in-situ instruments and 4 imaging instruments collecting science data at combined rates of 235 kbps (nominal) to 424 kbps (peak). The instrument suite is anticipated to have a total mass of 65 kg and average power consumption of 55 W. The STORM spacecraft bus will provide a 3-axis stabilized platform with nominal pointing requirements (knowledge &lt; 0.02 deg, control &lt; 0.1 deg, stability &lt; 0.02 deg in 10 s). STORM will operate for a minimum of two years, offering perspectives on the magnetosphere from a wide variety of vantage points.</p>
<p>The mission technical requirements are identified in the separate document: "Additional Details for Partnership Opportunity Document (POD) For NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Spacecraft Flight Systems for the Solar-Terrestrial Observer for Reconnection in the Magnetosphere (STORM) Mission for the 2019 Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Heliophysics Announcement of Opportunity (AO)."</p>
<p>Notice of Interest</p>
<p>Potential respondents are asked to contact GSFC with a Notice of Interest for the mission concept described here. This Notice of Interest does not create an obligation to respond to the POD, but allows the GSFC team to disseminate additional technical details about the mission concept. Notice of Interest respondents will receive a document containing additional details, which can be used to facilitate a focused response to the partnership opportunity. These details are competition sensitive and are not to be shared beyond the necessary persons to prepare a full response. Respondents may send questions to the GSFC point of contact (POC) listed below. All questions and answers will be made available to all those who respond with a Notice of Interest. The identity of the source of the questions shall be held confidential.</p>
<p>The Notice of Interest shall be sent to the POC listed via email with &lsquo;Notice of Interest' in the subject line, a simple sentence or two expressing interest and an email address to send further information, and it must be received by the due date listed above.</p>
<p>3.0 Pre-confirmation Support</p>
<p>3.1 Proposal Support</p>

<CONTACT>Catherine Kennedy, Contract Specialist, Email catherine.kennedy3@nih.gov - Rukshani Levy, Contracting Officer, Email rukshani.levy@nih.gov
<DESC><strong>Introduction:</strong><br /><br />
<div>This is a Non Research and Development (Non R&amp;D) Source Sought notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources including small and small disadvantaged businesses to perform a potential Non R&amp;D requirement.
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>This National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) project is for the work related to the contract below:</p>
<p>Clinical Trials Monitoring Service, Theradex (Contract HHSN261201700009C)</p>
<p>This  contract was awarded on a competitive basis for a five year period (inclusive of options) in 2017 for the services to provide data management, quality assurance, clinical trial monitoring and auditing capability for NCI sponsored clinical trials at participating sites both within and outside of the U.S. and monitoring for current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) for biopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and Good Laboratory Practices for Core Laboratories performing investigational integral and integrated biomarker assays. The contract was awarded with an initial Base Period of May 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018; and included four one-year Option Periods for a total potential performance period through April 30, 2022. The total potential value of the contract, inclusive of Options, is $34,496,228.</p>
<p><br />This contract supports the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI in fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities as IND sponsor and to assure compliance with protocol and regulatory requirements and verification of the integrity of the data via source data verification for clinical trials.   The monitoring of participant safety for trials is under the purview of a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  A Data Safety Monitoring Board is an independent group of experts who monitor patient safety and treatment efficacy data while a clinical trial is ongoing.  Currently, the organization leading the trial is responsible for having a DSMB for randomized phase 2 studies.  However, as the number of randomized multi-center phase 2 trials has increased, this has created the need for a centralized DSMB. NCI has a need for this additional work to support the establishment and coordination of the centralized DSMB under NCI Contract HHSN26120170009C with Theradex.</p>
<p>This Source Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NCI.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives: </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Non Research and Development Source Sought Notice is to discern whether or not there are other contractors, including small and small disadvantaged businesses, capable of and interested in performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>As a result of this Non R&amp;D Source Sought Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) if it deems this necessary and appropriate.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Source Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications of any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to increase the quantity of labor hours delivered to the Government through the remainder of the current contract, increasing the effort to provide technical expertise and services to develop and implement a centralized Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for randomized phase 2 studies conducted by the NCI Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>The Organization must provide technical expertise and services to support a centralized DSMB.  DSMB standard operating procedures (SOPs) should follow NCI Data and Safety Monitoring Guidelines (See:  https://rrp.cancer.gov/clinicalTrials/data_safety_monitoring_plan.htm.</p>
<p>The Organization will be required to:</p>
<p>1.	Develop and implement SOPs for the operation of a DSMB which conform with the NCI Data and Safety Monitoring Guidelines as stated in:  https://rrp.cancer.gov/clinicalTrials/data_safety_monitoring_plan.htm.  SOPs shall include confidentiality agreements and policies to mitigate interest of board members and contractor staff involved in this activity.</p>
<p>2.	As part of the SOPs, develop and implement procedures for data management processes related to data freezes and data locks so that an electronic record of the findings at the time of the DSMB review is retained should this be requested by the Sponsor or a Regulatory Authority.</p>
<p>3.	Constitute the DSMB with ten outside experts which must be approved in advance by CTEP.  DSMB members will be paid an honorarium through the contract.</p>
<p>4.	Coordinate the DSMB review of approximately 60 randomized studies per year.  DSMB meetings shall be held up to three times per year with a face-to-face meeting once every 18 months. Other DSMB meetings may be held via webinar.</p>
<p>5.	Generate reports for the DMSB to include both safety and efficacy data.  Efficacy data must be closely guarded and kept confidential due to financial and regulatory implications if made is made public prematurely.  Recommendations of the DSMB meetings shall be provided to CTEP.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong><br /> <br />The increase in an estimate of 4,200 Labor Hours is anticipated to be applied to Option Period 1 (February 1, 2019 -April 30, 2019), Option Period 2 (May 1, 2019 - April 30, 2020), Option Period 3 (May 2, 2020 - April 30, 2021), and Option Period 4 (May 1, 2021 - April 30, 2022), of the current contract.</p>

<DESC><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.<br /><br />The purpose of this RFI is to determine whether there are mature or developing technologies from commercial or interagency sources that can provide comprehensive, cost effective solution to BioWatch's current laboratory information management system. This desired sample tracking platform will provide the capability to support the laboratories in the BioWatch network to track individual samples, track the reagents associated with the analysis of the sample, trace the data obtained, input this information into a comprehensive database, and report results in a verifiable manner. As depicted in Figure 2, the BioWatch Sample Laboratory Information Management System (BW-SLIMS) must be able to accept direct and mediated data from other sample and laboratory information management systems and also be able to send data to such systems. The ultimate goal of the BW-SLIMS is to collect, compile, transmit, and allow queries of sample information from throughout the BioWatch user community.

The dike is approximately 700 to 800 feet in length.<br />The 3.5 foot raised will consist of earth fill from toe-to-crest on the downstream slope. The raised crest width will be approximately 25 feet. Along the existing downstream slope and toe of the dike, a chimney drain and key trench excavation that extends a minimum of 4 feet below the existing ground surface to remove surficial soils and weathered rock (amphibolite schist). Materials for drain rock, filter sand, and embankment fill will need to be imported during construction. Rock slope protection will be installed on the upstream slope.

The dosimeters shall be provided to the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center monthly. The Oklahoma City VA Medical Center will return the dosimeters to the contractor for analysis.

OSL Dosimeters or equivalent
The OSL dosimeter or equivalent shall measure x, gamma and beta radiation for the whole body and extremities.
The OSL dosimeter or equivalent shall be sealed inside a tamperproof plastic blister pack to eliminate possible mishandling, light leakage or lost detection elements. 
The OSL dosimeter or equivalent shall be unaffected by heat moisture and pressure. 
The OSL dosimeter or equivalent shall come in individually wrapped pouches with a card containing worker information.
The dosimeters shall be divided into department groupings with series name and or code indicated on each dosimeter.
The wear period for a dosimeter is one month.

Ring Dosimeters (TLD)
The ring dosimeter shall measure exposure due to x, beta and gamma radiation with TL (thermos luminescent) technology. 
The TLD shall be encapsulated inside an identification cover, so the identity of the chip and the wearer is always maintained. 
The rings shall be able to be worn in dry or wet working conditions and cold sterilized without compromising the integrity of the dosimeter. 
The rings shall come in 3 or more sizes; small, medium and large. 
The edges of the ring shall be smooth so they are able to be worn inside surgical gloves.

The contractor shall notify the Oklahoma City VAMC by phone and/or fax within 24 hours of findings when an individual s dose exceeds:
20% of the regulatory limits (e.g. deep, lens of eye, shallow, etc.) for any given wear period
50% of regulatory limits year to date 
Levels set by the Oklahoma City VAMC. 
 
Dose Exposure Reports: 
Reports shall cover each wear period (monthly) and include cumulative totals. The reports shall comply with NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission), OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), and DOE (Department of Energy) regulations.  Dose equivalents arising from exposure to photons (x or gamma rays) shall have deep, lens of the eye and shallow value reported. Beta exposures shall be reported as a shallow dose equivalent. Dose reports shall be given to the VAMC on a monthly and yearly basis. The reports shall include the following: participant number, name, ID number, dosimeter, use, rad type, rad quality, inception date, serial number, dose equivalent (mrem) for: monthly wear period, quarter to date, year to date, lifetime to date. Each period shall have the following categories; DDE (deep dose equivalent), LDE (lens dose equivalent), and SDE (shallow dose equivalent). The reports shall also include VA facility information, account number, received date, and reported date. 

METER (Multiple Employer Total Exposure Report)
The contractor shall supply a monthly report that list individuals who have activity in other dose monitoring accounts during the calendar year.

OSL dosimeters, the detector shall have the ability to be re-stimulated numerous times to confirm the accuracy of a radiation does measurement. A full reanalysis shall be performed for every dose in excess of 500 mrem.  Imaging to identify static, dynamic or contaminated conditions shall be automatically performed for all beta and low-energy photon measurements yielding a dose in excess of 500 mrem. Reanalysis of doses at less than 500 mrem shall be performed if requested by the OKC VAMC. The contractor shall have the ability to differentiate between static and dynamic exposure. TLD Ring dosimeters, shall measure x, beta and gamma radiation with a lithium fluoride chip. Accurate determination of exposure shall be supported by calibrations using a phantom. Rings shall be scanned to identify and track each ring from receipt to report. The process shall be overseen by knowledgeable technicians. The glow curve of the readout that permits a more conclusive evaluation of radiation exposure shall be retrieved and analyzed before the exposure report is generated if any anomaly appears.

<CONTACT>Emily Baker, Contract Specialist, Phone 5862827463, Email emily.m.baker25.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The United States Army Contracting Command - Warren (ACC-WRN) intends to issue a Request for Prototype Proposals (RFPP) for the Development of a Stryker In-Vehicle Network (IVN-2) on or about <br />December 27, 2018. The RFPP will be issued under the Defense Automotive Technologies Consortium Other Transaction Agreement (DATC OTA), W56HZV-16-9-0001 PA026. The DATC OTA was awarded under the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b, Section 815 of the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, P.L 114-92.
<p>The Government is planning to pursue a prototype project for the design, development and testing of components for the Stryker In-Vehicle Network (IVN-2) Rugged Keyboard Video Mouse (KVM) which will result in a prototype IVN-2 KVM. The prototype IVN2 KVM is intended to support a minimum of three computing devices and up to four total computing devices connected to a single display.</p>
<p>Currently TEMPEST and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) approved KVMs are used in office environments to span unclassified to secret classification levels. This allows the user to switch between the use of four different computing devices while only needing a single set of input hardware (keyboard, video, mouse and display). In the case of this project a display with touch screen and bezel controls will be used instead of a display with a keyboard and mouse. This new unit will create a clean break between the different classification levels without the addition of displays (saving space, weight, and power). Per unit cost of the end product and schedule are key aspects. Creating a rugged direct current (DC) powered version of an existing certified commercial/industrial unit, is a very desirable approach. The prototype and end product shall support four total computing devices connected to a single display. The Government anticipates that the Stryker IVN-2 KVM prototype project will lead to a follow-on production effort.</p>
<p>Follow-on Production:<br />In accordance with 10.U.S.C. 2371b(f), and upon a determination that this competitively awarded prototype project has been successfully completed, this prototype project may result in the award of a follow-on production contract or transaction without the use of competitive procedures.</p>
<p>NOTE:<br />This Special Notice is for informational purposes only. A prototype project will not be awarded in response to this announcement. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of the Defense Automotive Technologies Consortium (DATC), and industry in general, advanced notification of the Government's intent to release a RFPP to the DATC membership. The RFPP will be issued to the DATC, who will then issue the RFPP to the members. For information on DATC and/or how to become a member, visit the following website: http://datc.saeitc.org/</p>

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) intends to award an order to the Association of Supervisors of Banks of the Americas (ASBA) for one membership.
<p>ASBA consists of bank supervisors and regulatory institutions from 34 countries throughout the Americas (North, South, Central America, the Caribbean, and Spain, including the U.S. - FRB, FDIC and OCC). ASBA's objectives are to develop, disseminate, and promote banking supervisory practices throughout the Americas in line with international standards, and to support the development of banking supervision expertise and resources in the Americas, through the effective provision of training and technical cooperation services.</p>
<p>The OCC acquires associate membership in ASBA to:</p>
<p>&bull;Participate in ASBA Board issues to help shape the group's direction;</p>
<p>&bull;Boost OCC standing in region as leading international bank supervisor;</p>
<p>&bull;Influence the lifting of supervisory standards and level the playing field with positive consequences for national banks active in the region;</p>
<p>&bull;Forge stronger supervisory relations with leading supervisors;</p>
<p>&bull;Influence the direction of the group towards issues of concern for OCC, e.g., improving access by home supervisors to host jurisdictions to facilitate consolidated supervision;</p>
<p>&bull;Participate in training efforts which ASBA coordinates for the region. Over time, the OCC could become less connected to the region;</p>
<p>&bull;if it is not included/does not participate in the region's training programs;</p>
<p>&bull;Use OCC resources in the most efficient manner by coordinating our technical assistance to the region through ASBA;</p>
<p>&bull;Align with the Financial Stability Forum and the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision in efforts to reach out to non G-10 countries;</p>
<p>This requirement will have a period of performance of 02/01/2019 through 01/31/2020. ASBA is the sole source for the needed requirement.&nbsp;This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, firms that believe they can provide a service that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within (5) days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a competitive basis, based upon the responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Plasma-Therm, LLC. for the procurement of a 4-inch upgrade kit for NIST's existing Plasma-Therm reactive ion etch and high density chemical vapor deposition system.  The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>The CNST NanoFab has a need to procure a 4-inch upgrade kit for the Plasma-Therm HD-PECVD system currently installed in the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology's (CNST) NanoFab. The NIST CNST NanoFab relies on the HD-PECVD tool to deposit insulating materials such as silicon dioxide and silicon nitride which are used during nanofabrication process development.  This upgrade is necessary as it will significantly improve the quality of films being deposited and provide researchers more consistent and robust films with which to build devices upon.</p>
<p>Currently, users are having difficulty achieving uniform film properties both across their substrate and through the thickness of the deposited film due to changing conditions during their deposition.  This has resulted in increased need for chamber conditioning and reworking of user research samples.</p>
<p>The Plasma Therm systems operate with a proprietary chamber design and control system.  The required information to supply and install the needed parts is not available from any vendor other than the OEM.  No other parts can be substituted.</p>
<p>Plasma-Therm, has the responsibility of maintaining these unique systems.   As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), they have the upgrades readily available within our expedited delivery schedules.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and shall be in accordance with the Contractors established manufacturing lead times.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333242, and the size standard is 1500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by established due date/time set forth in this notice. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joni.laster@nist.gov . No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>PURPOSE:

This solicitation requests the contractor to monitor, report, and maintain internet access to be provided to students, patients, and guests at the Fort Meade VA Medical Center Campus.

BACKGROUND:

The site consists of a major hospital with surrounding buildings. The guest wireless internet service has been limited to Buildings 113, 145, 146, and 148. In addition to patients that visit the facility for periodic appointments, some are required to stay overnight or for multiple days depending on their medical condition and prognosis. The VA recognizes that its patient population and family members use the internet as a means of both researching information as well as remaining in communication with friends and family members on a near-constant basis. As a result, it is our desire to provide these patients and their family members  access to the internet to allow them to continue their communication. The VA also recognizes that the proper operation and functioning of a major health care facility requires its staff to have constant network and internet access. Therefore, the intent of this initiative is to provide our patients and their families internet access without impinging on the efficient and effective operation of the hospital and its clinics.

OBJECTIVE:

The VA is seeking a solution to provide our patients and their families access to the internet while they are using our facilities in Fort Meade. The objectives of this proposal are to:

Integrate into the existing wireless network infrastructure content filtering, help desk services for guests, and on-site technical support for the following areas:
Patient Rooms
Patient and Visitor Waiting Areas
Expanded wireless services to all areas frequented by patients, and visitors
Student work areas
Provide a splash screen during entry to the wireless network that welcomes users to BHHCS internet.  This guest wireless network must permit user access without username or password authentication.
Implement advisory banners and logging for all VA-provided public internet access.
Utilize a content filtering solution for monitoring on all VA-provided public internet access.
Log files must be maintained for a one year period. Vendor must provide log files as requested for investigations.

<p><br />CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p><br />NMCARS<br />NMCARS 5237.102-90 Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA)<br />The contractor shall report contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth via a secure data collection site.

<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)<br />Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.</p>
<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com.<br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care.<br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.</p>
<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com.<br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care.<br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Gauze Compressed. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Gauze Compressed products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Gauze Compressed in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Gauze Compressed will be established approximately May 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately June 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Gauze Compressed. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Gauze Compressed.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Gauze Compressed. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $221,917. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. One item is required for addition to the QSL and accounts for 100 % ($221,917) of the total volume in sales ($221,917). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Linens, Reusable. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Linens, Reusable products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at <a href="https://www.medical.dla.mil">https://www.medical.dla.mil</a>. <br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Linens, Reusable in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Linens, Reusable will be established approximately March 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately April 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Linens, Reusable. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Linens, Reusable.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Linens, Reusable. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,044,624.55. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Four items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 59.6 % ($622,992.79) of the total volume in sales ($1,044,624.55). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br /></span>The requirements for this product line are outlined below.

        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

<DESC>This solicitation is in accordance with FAR Part 15 and FAR Part 19.5.<br /><br />The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), through this acquisition, intends to award a contract to procure a wide range of program support services for the Office of Extramural Research (OER) of the NIH.
<p>The NIH mission is to uncover new knowledge that shall lead to better health for everyone. NIH accomplishes that mission by: conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.</p>
<p>OER supports the NIH extramural research by providing policy and guidance to the 24 NIH Institutes and Centers (IC) that award grants. OER serves as a vital interface for the biomedical research community by guiding investigators through the process of attaining grants funding and helping them understand and navigate through federal policies and procedures. OER's mission is to provide the corporate framework for NIH research administration, ensuring scientific integrity, public accountability, and effective stewardship of the NIH extramural research portfolio.</p>
<p>Through interactions with major stakeholders, OER supports the research enterprise by ensuring appropriate policies, procedures and systems for oversight are in place while, at the same time, considering the impact on our research partners. Our responsibilities span a wide breadth of support systems including developing policies and procedures and providing electronic systems for extramural staff and more than 100,000 investigators worldwide. For many of these activities we provide support to other agency partners as well.</p>

<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov no later than 1700 hrs PST, December 17, 2018.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Beverly J. Parker at (541) 867-8730 or beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov  for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />(b)	Requirements.</p>
<p>1.	It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>2.	The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.</p>
<p>3.	If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6,.07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i.	Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii.	The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4.	The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within          business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.</p>
<p>Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion.</p>
<p>Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.</p>
<p>i.	The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.<br />ii.	The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training.<br />iii.	NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor.<br />iv.	Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.</p>
<p>5.	The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees.</p>
<p>(c)	Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.</p>
<p>For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee.<br />All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:</p>
<p>&bull;	Phone: 1-866-288-6558<br />&bull;	Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org<br />&bull;	Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores)<br />&bull;	Text: (202) 335-0265</p>
<p>(d)	Confidentiality.</p>
<p>Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.<br />(e)	Remedies.</p>
<p>In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in:</p>
<p>1.	Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract;<br />2.	Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract;<br />3.	Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action;<br />4.	Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract;<br />5.	Suspension or debarment; or<br />6.	Other appropriate action.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract language)</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p><br />1330-52.237-71 Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the is(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to joel.heisler@noaa.gov no later than 12:00pm PST, Friday, 12/14/18.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Joel Heisler at (541) 867-8763 or joel.heisler@noaa.gov  for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>*********NOTE**********<br /><br />This combined synopsis/solicitation is being amended to include the following changes:<br />1. The attached Drawing - Q7375-01 and Statement of Work have been modified to clarify the requirements.<br />2. The following questions submitted by potential contractors have been addressed:
<p><strong>Question</strong>: The drawing does not indicate the following conditions:</p>

<p>Removal of all burrs and sharp edges:</p>
<p><br /><strong>Answer</strong>: <br />Regarding Allowable Tolerances:<br />All size tolerances +/-.06" except hole diameters, which is +/-.025".</p>
<p>Regarding the finishing:<br />There is no specific finishing requirement, as the Government will be performing additional manufacturing processes once received.</p>
<p>Regarding removal of all burrs and sharp edges: <br />Burrs and sharp edges shall be removed in accordance with standard practices.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Drawing #737501 specifies Material as Aluminum 50832-H321 er ASTM B209.<br />However, Page 4 of 5 specifies Armor Aluminum 50862-H32, Spec ASTM B209</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Per the Buy American Statute, YES, the aluminum must be manufactured in the United States.</p>
<p><br />3. The Evaluation Criteria section has been modified to clarify how proposals will be evaluated:<br /><br />1.0 Basis for Award<br />The Government's selection for the Call Order awardee will be made on the basis of the lowest priced quote meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, lowest price technically acceptable source selection process. The Call Order will be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible by the Contracting Officer, in accordance with the General Standards for contractor responsibility at FAR 9.104-1, and whose proposal conforms to all of the solicitation's requirements (including stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is assessed, based on the evaluation factors below, to represent the lowest price technically acceptable.</p>
<p>2.0 Evaluation Factors &amp; Evaluation Approach<br />All proposals will be evaluated in a fair and consistent manner. All proposals will be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. The offeror whose proposal is determined to provide the lowest priced proposal that meets the acceptability standards for non-cost factors will be awarded the Call Order. <br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low priced when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program. <br />The Government reserves the right to award based on initial proposals. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the Call Order without discussions with the offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306). However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request proposal revisions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. <br />Factor 1 - Technical</p>
<p>The proposals will be evaluated based on the criteria established in this solicitation as follows.</p>
<p>In order to achieve an Acceptable rating in the Technical factor, the offeror's proposal must clearly meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>a. Technical Approach: The offeror's proposal shall demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements as defined in the Statement of Work to include:</p>
<p>i. The contractor shall meet the following military standards and/or industry standard for the listed materials on the specified drawings in the solicitation. <br />a. PART: 7375-01</p>
<p>ii. The Contractor shall deliver materials within the delivery schedule specified on Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated to determine an offeror's Understanding of the Requirements and Feasibility of Approach.</p>
<p>(1) Understanding the Requirements - The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it demonstrates a clear and complete understanding of all requirements involved including capabilities, knowledge and expertise in the requested services and meeting the requirements presented by the SOW.</p>
<p>(2) Feasibility of Approach - The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the SOW requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. The evaluation will also consider the realism of the allocated hours, labor categories and price being proposed in the offeror's response to the SOW.</p>
<p><br />ADJECTIVAL RATING/DEFINITION <br />ACCEPTABLE/Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE/Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2 - Price<br />1. The Total Evaluated Price will be determined by summing the price proposed on each Line Item. This Total Evaluated Price will then be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with price analysis techniques at FAR 15.404-1(b). Price will not be scored. <br />2. An offeror must propose on all Line Items to be considered for award. <br />3. Price will NOT be scored with any rating. The Government will evaluate the total quoted price (inclusive of the base period and all option years) for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3. The proposed prices for each CLIN, to include Option CLINs, will be added together to achieve one total evaluated price. <br />4. Price/Cost Inconsistencies: A proposal is presumed to represent an offeror's best effort to respond to the solicitation. Each initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms for award for this contract. Any inconsistencies in performance or price should be explained in the proposal. Any significant inconsistencies, if unexplained, raise a fundamental issue of the offeror's understanding of the nature and scope of work required and its financial ability to perform the contract, and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal.</p>

This combined synopsis/solicitation is being amended to:
<p>1. Address a question from a potential contractor</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: I have some concerns regarding the required delivery of 45 days ARO due to material lead time and the pending Holiday season. In an effort to narrow this down, can you tell me when you anticipate releasing the award after the submission deadline of 12/11/2018? Is there any possibility we could offer partial delivery inside the 45 day window and the balance as soon as possible afterwards?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Our estimate for award after receipt of proposals would be 21-27 December 2018. According to the most recent amendment and in answering a similar question, we responded: "Our market research indicates that most contractors have an established supply chain that should make the delivery times feasible". Delivery schedule for bas has been updated to 60 days. Partial deliveries are acceptable, but all deliveries must be completed within the 60 days.</p>
<p>2. Update the following evaluation factor:</p>
<p>Technical:<br />ii. The Contractor shall deliver materials within the delivery schedule specified on Statement of Work.<br /><br />Note: 7 December 2018<br /><br />Updated SOW (Delivery days after award for Option Period)<br />Updated Evaluation Factors<br />Updated Delivery Schedule days in question from 6 December.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br /><br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-70 CONTRACTOR COMMUNICATIONS <br />(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.<br />(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.<br />(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-71 NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Contract Language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-71 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted ________ hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.<br />(End of Contract Language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018) <br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA. <br />(a) Definitions. <br />Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members. <br />Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim. <br />Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: <br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. <br />The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures. <br />(b) Requirements. <br />1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. <br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. <br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. <br />i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. <br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable). <br />4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.<br />Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. <br />Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance. <br />i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed. <br />ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. <br />iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. <br />iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106. <br />5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. <br />(c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline. <br />For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including: <br />&bull; Phone: 1-866-288-6558 <br />&bull; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org <br />&bull; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores) <br />&bull; Text: (202) 335-0265 <br />(d) Confidentiality. <br />Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.<br />(e) Remedies. <br />In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in: <br />1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract; <br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract; <br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action; <br />4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract; <br />5. Suspension or debarment; or 6. Other appropriate action.</p>

ADDITIONAL CHANGES ARE FORTHCOMING.<br /></span></em></strong><br />Description: ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA THE BIDDER INQUIRY<br />PORTAL IN PROJNET AS DESCRIBED IN THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS BELOW.<br />This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E services are required to provide primarily hydrographic survey and mapping services in support of the civil works mission area. The contractor will be required to perform services primarily within the USACE Galveston District but up to the Southwestern Division area of responsibility.</p>
<p>This announcement is for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A-E services with a total shared capacity of $7,000,000 and includes a target of one (1) Unrestricted A-E IDC and a target of one (1) reserve Small Business IDCs. The Government may award more or less than one (1) firm within each business class depending on the source selection decision regarding how many contractors are considered most highly qualified in accordance with Brooks Act procedures.</p>
<p>All firms responding to this solicitation MUST identify in which category they are submitting.<br />Firms should state the words UNRESTRICTED or SMALL BUSINESS after the solicitation number in PART I, A Block 3 of form SF 330. A separate proposal MUST be submitted for each category in which the firm wants consideration. Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only firms considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Multiple awards will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of five (5) years, which includes a three (3) year base period and two (2) year option. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed $7,000,000 over the five-year life of the contracts.</p>
<p>Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. The small business size standard is a maximum of $15 million of average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years. All interested Other than Small Business A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. Large businesses selected for this contract must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Large businesses selected for this contract will be required to submit these plans during contract negotiation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541370 (Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services).</p>
<p>Selection for Task Order Negotiation after Award: The minimum guarantee for each contract will be $2,500, applicable to the base period only. The maximum task order amount for the Unrestricted would be $3,000,000 and for the Small Business reserve would be $150,000, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer based upon a review of the task order scope and confirmation that a firm is considered most highly qualified, based upon a review of their SF 330. All requirements with an estimated value at or below the maximum amount will be reserved for the Small Business class first. Should review of the qualifications of the Small Business firm find they are not highly qualified to perform the requirement or do not contain the appropriate in-house resources to self-perform the required minimum amount of work, the government will then proceed to the Unrestricted class. The government will not consider a requirement above the $150,000 threshold to be automatically directed to the Unrestricted class, as the Small Business reserve will be considered first for each requirement irrespective of its estimated value. After task order requirements are defined, Galveston District will determine if the SF 330s submitted in response to this synopsis provide the information needed to provide a basis to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements, or if additional, task order-specific information is needed to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements.</p>

<DESC><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ATTENTION: THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE FOR THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN EXTENDED FROM 10 DECEMBER 2018 TO 13 DECEMBER 2018. <br /></span></em></strong><br />Description: ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA THE BIDDER INQUIRY<br />PORTAL IN PROJNET AS DESCRIBED IN THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS BELOW.<br />This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E services are required to provide primarily land survey and mapping services in support of the civil works, military and International and Interagency Services (IIS) mission areas. The contractor will be required to perform services primarily within the USACE Galveston District (SWG) but up to the Southwestern Division (SWD) area of responsibility.</p>
<p>This announcement is for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A-E services with a total shared capacity of $10,000,000 and includes a target of two Small Business IDCs. The Government may award more or less than two firms depending on the source selection decision regarding how many contractors are considered most highly qualified in accordance with Brooks Act procedures.</p>
<p>Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only firms considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Multiple awards will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of five (5) years, which includes a three (3) year base period and two (2) year option. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed $10,000,000 over the five-year life of the contracts.</p>
<p>Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. The small business size standard is a maximum of $15 million of average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541370 (Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services).</p>
<p>Contractor Manpower Reporting: For any task orders associated with military funding types, the contractor shall report ALL contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for the Department of Defense via a secure data collection site. The contractor is required to completely fill in all required data fields using the following web address: http://www.ecmra.mil/.

Contractors may direct questions to the help desk at: http://www.ecmra.mil/.</p>
<p>Selection for Task Order Negotiation after Award: The minimum guarantee for each contract will be $2,500, applicable to the base period only. The maximum task order amount will be $3,000,000 unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer based upon a review of the task order scope and confirmation that a firm is considered most highly qualified, based upon a review of their SF 330. After task order requirements are defined, Galveston District will determine if the SF 330s submitted in response to this synopsis provide the information needed to provide a basis to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements, or if additional, task order-specific information is needed to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements.</p>

<DESC><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>ALL CHANGES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOLICITATION ARE IN BOLD UNDERLINED ITALICS.</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Description: ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA THE BIDDER INQUIRY<br />PORTAL IN PROJNET AS DESCRIBED IN THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS BELOW.<br />This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.</p>
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E services are required to provide primarily hydrographic survey and mapping services in support of the civil works mission area. The contractor will be required to perform services primarily within the USACE Galveston District but up to the Southwestern Division area of responsibility.</p>
<p>This announcement is for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A-E services with a total shared capacity of $7,000,000 and includes a target of one (1) Unrestricted A-E IDC and a target of one (1) reserve Small Business IDCs. The Government may award more or less than one (1) firm within each business class depending on the source selection decision regarding how many contractors are considered most highly qualified in accordance with Brooks Act procedures.</p>
<p>All firms responding to this solicitation MUST identify in which category they are submitting.<br />Firms should state the words UNRESTRICTED or SMALL BUSINESS after the solicitation number in PART I, A Block 3 of form SF 330. A separate proposal MUST be submitted for each category in which the firm wants consideration. Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only firms considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Multiple awards will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of five (5) years, which includes a three (3) year base period and two (2) year option. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed $7,000,000 over the five-year life of the contracts.</p>
<p>Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. The small business size standard is a maximum of $15 million of average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years. All interested Other than Small Business A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. Large businesses selected for this contract must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Large businesses selected for this contract will be required to submit these plans during contract negotiation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541370 (Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services).</p>
<p>Selection for Task Order Negotiation after Award: The minimum guarantee for each contract will be $2,500, applicable to the base period only. The maximum task order amount for the Unrestricted would be $3,000,000 and for the Small Business reserve would be $150,000, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer based upon a review of the task order scope and confirmation that a firm is considered most highly qualified, based upon a review of their SF 330. All requirements with an estimated value at or below the maximum amount will be reserved for the Small Business class first. Should review of the qualifications of the Small Business firm find they are not highly qualified to perform the requirement or do not contain the appropriate in-house resources to self-perform the required minimum amount of work, the government will then proceed to the Unrestricted class. The government will not consider a requirement above the $150,000 threshold to be automatically directed to the unrestricted class, as the Small Business reserve will be considered first for each requirement irrespective of its estimated value. After task order requirements are defined, Galveston District will determine if the SF 330s submitted in response to this synopsis provide the information needed to provide a basis to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements, or if additional, task order-specific information is needed to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.</p>
<p>Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Technology is changing the way we live and learn, opening exceptional opportunities for those of us committed to Air Force education, training and development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We must keep pace to bring these innovations to our Air Force and its Airmen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To achieve success in this area, we will design, manage and sustain a force development infrastructure that leverages emergent technology where and when appropriate including but not limited to: abundant computing devices, flexible classroom designs, innovative visual displays, games and simulations, collaborative tools, and mechanisms that both track and assess an Airmen's learning efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We will also exploit the incredible innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>For instance, AI is being leveraged to create intelligent tutors. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The software operates in the background of a learning experience, sensing the individual's strengths and weaknesses and presenting materials accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This approach allows learners to progress at their own rates even as they demonstrate measurable mastery in each new topic area presented.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Games and Simulation</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">We must be agile and flexible in the face of emerging global threats. Whether it's in contested or uncontested environments or in training simulators, realistic training environments are vital to our future force. Simulation technologies such as image generation, visualization and interoperability must keep pace with operational training demands to maximize mission readiness.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Experiential Learning</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Airmen will have dramatically expanded learning opportunities available to them - any time, any place and on any device. To enable this paradigm, AETC organizations will move to cloud-based systems that support cross-domain and multi-system learning. Schoolhouses will provide more opportunities for students to obtain "real-world skills" that are current and relevant. Additionally, in-unit collaborative projects will be established as post-course requirements for hands-on experience and observations which ensure learned skills are reinforced.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The most dramatic factor shaping the future of force development is big-data analytics. As we have transitioned from analog to digital data storage, the volume and variety of data has grown exponentially. Through data analytic capabilities, AETC will extract value and meaning from these enormous data sets. These capabilities will provide a targeted approach that empowers decision making based on predictive algorithms for accession, certification, attrition and future outcomes such as course-taking patterns.</span></p>

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION:

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Program Operations (AJF), Aircraft Maintenance Directorate (AJF-2) is conducting a Market Survey/ Request for information (RFI) for planning purposes, for possible sources to modify three (3) FAA Beechcraft C90GTi Aircraft with a project rack for inflight data collection.  The FAA requests a rough order of magnitude (ROM) of the cost, equipment and time necessary to accomplish the upgrade and obtain FAA approval. The three (3) aircraft must be modified no later than 31 May 2019.  The FAA intends to use a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract format for this requirement.  These aircraft operate out of Fort Worth Alliance Airport (AFW) in Fort Worth, Texas.  

Modifications to the aircraft will include:
	Add cabin configuration for 1 seat removed and replaced with a project rack
	Project rack will have 4 110V power outlets rated for a total of 10A
	Project rack will have GNSS, VOR and DME RF jacks routed to it
	Split VOR/LOC input to VOR/LOC #2 and route to project rack
	Add DME antenna to aircraft belly and route to project rack
	Add L1/L2/L5 GNSS antenna to top fuselage and route to project rack

All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/ RFI.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey/ RFI submissions will be solely at the interested partys expense.

Responders are required to complete and return to the FAA a copy of the Air Agency Certificate for the Service Center Repair Station that demonstrates they have the required certifications for accomplishing this modification and the Business Declaration Form.  This information will be used to help determine the FAAs procurement strategy if and when a formal SIR is issued to determine a source list for these modifications.
   
RESPONSE TO THIS MARKET SURVEY:

The information provided in response to this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.  (See Attachment A)

All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead.  Information generated in direct response to this RFI shall be prepared using a type font of no less than 12-point.  Standard published commercial information may be provided in the original printed format.  Responses must be received no later than 3:00 P.M., Central Time on Monday, November 26, 2018.

At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.  The market survey responses will provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing its procurement method. The NAICS code for this effort is 336413, Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing, with a size standard of 1000 employees.

<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Acquisition Management, Cincinnati Acquisition Division intends to negotiate a sole source contract to provide the Transportation and Climate Division (TCD) of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) with full access to UC Davis STEPS+ research products for transportation technologies, fuels, and future mobility, as well as access to the UC Davis STEPS advisory board. This procurement is being conducted under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NAICS Code 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, applies to this procurement and the size standard is 1000 employees. University of California, Davis, is classified as other than small business concern.</p>
<p>This procurement consists of acquiring a one-year sponsorship of UC Davis STEPS+ (Sustainable Transportation Pathways) consortium as well as three of the STEPS centers (Plug-In Hybrid &amp; Electric Vehicles, 3 Revolutions Future Mobility, and Energy Modeling &amp; Alternative Fuels.) Specific tasks and deliverables are as follows:</p>
<p>Tasks<br />Task 1 - UC Davis shall conduct STEPS+ Consortium research via the following STEPS centers: Plug-In Hybrid &amp; Electric Vehicles, 3 Revolutions Future Mobility, and Energy Modeling &amp; Alternative Fuels.<br />Task 2 - UC Davis shall provide the EPA with a customized engagement plan which will include meetings on transportation topics selected by the EPA<br />&bull; 2 meetings per year via teleconference to ensure UC Davis takes into consideration EPA research and policy objectives <br />&bull; Other teleconference meetings as needed based on EPA needs and priorities, not to exceed 3 calls per year. <br />Task 3 - UC Davis shall place up to two (2) EPA staff members (to be chosen by the EPA) to serve on the STEPS+ advisory board for both the overarching STEPS+ program and the specific STEPS+ centers for which EPA sponsorship is provided. EPA advisor shall be invited to attend the annual STEPS+ board meeting and shall be provided updates on latest STEPS+ research and an opportunity to provide feedback on the programs research and direction.</p>
<p>Deliverables<br />&bull; Access for several EPA employees (typically 2-3 employees and not to exceed 6) to attend the STEPS+ invitation-only research symposia. These are held biannually at UC Davis, dates are TBD and will be announced during the Period of Performance.<br />&bull; Access to all STEPS+ briefings, reports, and webinars, including early review of draft documents.<br />&bull; Free invitations for 2-3 employees to a STEPS workshop.<br />&bull; Password-protected access to all conference and workshop proceedings.</p>
<p>Without these leveraged resources (discussed below) the EPA would not be able to address OTAQ's broad research questions. With the STEPS+ institute, EPA's contract sponsorship provides it with access to over $3 million in research in sustainable transportation technology and policy per year - an amount no other research organization can provide in these areas of expertise. Additionally, because the project is a multi-year research program and continues to be supported by several government agencies, contracting with other organizations to duplicate previously completed work in order to address these current research areas would not be an efficient use of public resources. <br />Therefore, OTAQ has determined that the Institute is the only entity currently capable of successfully addressing the content and scope of this contract, thus justifying a single source acquisition. No other organization possesses all of the following resources:</p>
<p>1. Multidisciplinary Research Team and Organizational Structure focused on Sustainable Transportation<br />The Institute was founded in 2006 with research focused in three areas:<br />&bull; Travel behavior and transport systems modeling<br />&bull; Vehicle technologies and fuels<br />&bull; Emissions, air quality, and other environmental impacts</p>
<p>The Institute carries out research in these areas through its mission-specific centers within the institute. They include:<br />&bull; Plug-in Hybrid &amp; Electric Vehicles<br />&bull; Energy Modeling &amp; Alternative Fuels<br />&bull; China Center for Energy and Transportation<br />&bull; 3 Revolutions Future Mobility Program<br />&bull; Sustainable Freight<br />The Institute has developed a research team comprised of faculty, research leaders, and PhD/graduate students from diverse academic fields: vehicle engineering and design, systems analysis and operations research, chemical and mechanical engineering, lifecycle cost and emissions analysis, market research, sociology and anthropology, economics and business strategy, and policy analysis. No other organization has developed a program with an organizational structure that draws on such a broad range of academic fields for a comprehensive analysis of sustainable transportation issues and policy options. Given the broad scope of EPA's ongoing transportation projects to reduce impacts on public health and welfare, a large multi-disciplinary research team is necessary to address these topics. By reviewing academic literature focused on low-emission transportation and reviewing in detail the academic focus and organizational structure of other university transportation programs, we determined that no other program has a similar level of expertise in the relevant areas necessary for this project, specifically, research, modeling and analysis of technology and policy options that can address emissions and energy use from transportation.</p>
<p>2. Selection to lead the National Center for Sustainable Transportation<br />The Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis (ITS-Davis) is widely regarded by experts in the field as the leading university center on sustainable transportation, leading to its selection by the U.S. Department of Transportation to head the National Center for Sustainable Transportation (NCST) in September 2013. The NCST was originally two-year $11.2 million research, education, and outreach consortium to help federal, state, regional, and local agencies reduce the emissions from passenger and freight travel that contribute to climate change and enhance the sustainability of the national transportation system. Additional funding was provided to the Institute by the California Department of Transportation, the California Air Resources Board, the California Energy Commission, South Coast Air Quality Management District, and sources from Georgia and Vermont. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation re-authorized this national transportation center as part of the FAST (Fixing America's Surface Transportation) Act. The Institute is able to draw upon this ongoing work from its role as the NCST to support research under the STEPS+ Program. By funding the Institute, EPA is able to leverage a significant amount resources that are not available at other organizations.</p>
<p>3. Completion of First Three Phases of STEPS Program (2007 to 2018) <br />The Institute has developed an extensive knowledge base from its previous three STEPS research programs (2007-2010, 2011-2014, 2015-2018) that produced transparent comparisons of alternative energy and vehicle technology pathways. The previous research, funded by over 20 organizations including EPA, focused on addressing uncertainty that governments and companies face when making transportation policy/business decisions. Moreover, this analysis supports EPA's efforts to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. The proposed fourth phase of the STEPS+ Program builds upon the three previously completed studies. Without this extensive knowledge base, other organizations/programs would require a significant amount of time and funding, which EPA is unable to provide, to attain the necessary baseline knowledge needed for the completion of the proposed fourth phase of the STEPS Program.</p>
<p>4. Existing Consortium of Public &amp; Private Organizations <br />Over the past several years, the Institute has established a consortium of organizations that include major energy &amp; automotive companies, government agencies, environmental NGOs, and partner academic institutions. The EPA is able to leverage the years of research outcomes from the consortium's backing for its own contribution. In addition to producing valuable insight that helps shape EPA policy, the Institute also convenes industry leaders, government decision makers, and academic experts at symposia, workshops, and public policy events to formulate potential solutions for transportation development. The Institute's consortium serves as a venue for EPA to discuss key policies with major stakeholders directly impacted by the Agency's actions. No other research program allows EPA to leverage such a large amount of research with a relatively small contribution of funding. Additionally, no other university has established as broad of a consortium of key stakeholders to fund and support its research on the environmental impacts of transportation. Finally, the Institute's leadership in exploring approaches towards a more sustainable system is unique among transportation institutes.</p>

9. DESCRIPTION 
a.	Background: 
Under the authority of Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or Super fund of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA); Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recover y Act (RCRA) and pursuant to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) (40 CFR Part 300); and in accordance with any reauthorizations or amendment s to any of the above named statutes and  new response legislation, the EPA has been delegated the responsibility to undertake response actions with respect to the release or threat of r el ease of, hazardous substances, or pollutants and contaminants, that pose an actual or potential threat to human health or welfare, or to the environment.
b.	Navajo Area Uranium Mines (USEPA Region 9) 
The Navajo Nation encompasses more than 27,000 square miles, spread amongst the Four Corners Region of the USA (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona). The unique geology of the region makes the Navajo Nation rich in uranium, a radioactive ore in high demand after the development of atomic power and weapons at the close of World War II in the 1940s. Approximately four million tons of uranium ore were extracted during mining operations within the Navajo Nation from 1944 to 1986. Many Navajo people worked the mines, often living and raising families in close proximity to the mines and mills. 
Uranium mining and milling activities no longer occur on Navajo lands, but the legacy of these activities remains, including more than 500 abandoned uranium mine claims with thousands of mine features such as pits, trenches, holes, etc., and homes and drinking water sources with elevated levels of uranium, radium and other radionuclides. Uranium and other elements (selenium, arsenic, etc.) associated with mine and mill sites also occur naturally at elevated levels in rock, soil, surface water, and groundwater across the Navajo Nation and the broader Four Corners region. 
USEPA maintains a strong partnership with the Navajo Nation and, since 1994, the USEPA Superfund Program has provided technical assistance and funding to assess potentially contaminated sites and develop a response. In August 2007, the USEPA Superfund Program compiled a Comprehensive Database and Atlas  of all known uranium mines on the Navajo Nation. 
In October 2007, at the request of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, EPA, along with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Indian Health Service (IHS) developed a coordinated https://www.epa.gov/navajo-nation-uranium-cleanup to address uranium contamination in consultation with Navajo Nation EPA. 



In January 2013, these federal agencies, in consultation with the Navajo Nation, completed a five-year effort to address uranium contamination in the Navajo Nation. The effort focused on the most imminent risks to people living on the Navajo Nation. While the last five years represent a significant start in addressing the legacy of uranium mining, much work remains and the same federal agencies have collaborated to issue a second https://www.epa.gov/navajo-nation-uranium-cleanup . The purpose of the second Five-Year Plan is to build on the work of the first plan, make adjustments based on information gained during this period, and plan the next steps in addressing the most significant risks to human health and the environment. 
Although the legacy of uranium mining is widespread and will take many years to address completely, the collaborative effort of USEPA, other federal agencies, and the Navajo Nation will bring an unprecedented level of support and protection for the people at risk from these sites. Much work remains to be done, and USEPA is committed to working with the Navajo Nation to remove the most immediate contamination risks and to find permanent solutions to the remaining contamination on Navajo lands. 
c.	Grants Mining District (USEPA Region 6) 
The Grants Mining District comprises an area of 100 miles by 25 miles that was the primary location of uranium extraction and production activities in New Mexico from the 1950s until late into the 20th century. The Grants Mining District extends along the southern margin of the San Juan basin in Cibola, McKinley, Sandoval, and Bernalillo counties as well as Tribal lands.
Three mining sub-6 districts located within the Grants Mining District-Ambrosia Lake, Laguna, and Marquez-contain 97 legacy uranium mines with recorded uranium ore production of over 52 million tons outside of the boundaries of the Navajo Nation. During the operational period, many of the larger mines conducted extensive dewatering to access ore below the water table. Most effluent from dewatering received little or no treatment before discharge to the ground or surface drainages during the majority of the mine operational period, causing perennial stream flows in major drainages. The extensive dewatering operations significantly changed areal hydrologic conditions, resulting in continuing influx of oxygenated ground water to areas that were dewatered during the mine operational period. Other environmental impacts may have been caused by erosion and leaching of mine waste materials, some of which were deposited into arroyos where it remains to the present-day, and by the reported operation of on-site heap-leach and stope-leaching operations. Few of the legacy uranium mine sites have undergone surface reclamation, and many have physical hazards that remain such as open adits and shafts, as well as uncontrolled waste rock and ore piles on-site.
d.	Both Regions 6 and 9
The primary hazardous substance on all the sites referenced in the requirements Statement of Work (SOW) is radiological mine and mine related waste; therefore, a significant knowledge base of radiological material handling, environmental data interpretation, and data collection will be required to perform the activities within this SOW. 
The terrain to access site locations is rough, water is scarce, and the weather is often extreme in most areas. The trails and/or roads to the sites are not improved or maintained. To reach the site locations, 4-wheel drive vehicles (capable of drives over rough dirt/rocky roads) and/or hiking long distances is required. Roads can become impassable in wet weather, and conditions can change quickly. 
In summer, the conditions are hot and dry; in winter, elevations make them subject to severe cold and high winds. Due to the quick changes in the weather, be aware of the danger of flash floods. While this danger is greatest during the summer monsoon season (July through September), flash floods can occur at any time of the year. 
e.	Purpose and Objectives: 
The purpose of the Navajo Area Abandoned Mines Response and Construction Services (AMRCS) contract is to provide cleanup, response, and construction services to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), primarily at former uranium mining-related sites on or within the Navajo Nation (within EPA Region 9 in Arizona and New Mexico) and within the Grants Mining District (located in EPA Region 6 New Mexico).

The selected contractor(s) will be required to comply with OSHA 1910.120(e)(3)(ii) for working on a site with known and characterized hazardous substances. A minimum of 40-hour HAZWOPER training for all contractor personnel working on site is required, and must be able to provide current certifications.

The Grants Mining District extends along the southern margin of the San Juan basin in Cibola, McKinley, Sandoval, and Bernalillo counties as well as Tribal lands.
Three mining sub-6 districts located within the Grants Mining District-Ambrosia Lake, Laguna, and Marquez-contain 97 legacy uranium mines with recorded uranium ore production of over 52 million tons outside of the boundaries of the Navajo Nation. During the operational period, many of the larger mines conducted extensive dewatering to access ore below the water table. Most effluent from dewatering received little or no treatment before discharge to the ground or surface drainages during the majority of the mine operational period, causing perennial stream flows in major drainages. The extensive dewatering operations significantly changed areal hydrologic conditions, resulting in continuing influx of oxygenated ground water to areas that were dewatered during the mine operational period. Other environmental impacts may have been caused by erosion and leaching of mine waste materials, some of which were deposited into arroyos where it remains to the present-day, and by the reported operation of on-site heap-leach and stope-leaching operations. Few of the legacy uranium mine sites have undergone surface reclamation, and many have physical hazards that remain such as open adits and shafts, as well as uncontrolled waste rock and ore piles on-site.
d.	Both Regions 6 and 9
The primary hazardous substance on all the sites referenced in the requirements Statement of Work (SOW) is radiological mine and mine related waste; therefore, a significant knowledge base of radiological material handling, environmental data interpretation, and data collection will be required to perform the activities within this SOW. 
The terrain to access site locations is rough, water is scarce, and the weather is often extreme in most areas. The trails and/or roads to the sites are not improved or maintained. To reach the site locations, 4-wheel drive vehicles (capable of drives over rough dirt/rocky roads) and/or hiking long distances is required. Roads can become impassable in wet weather, and conditions can change quickly. 
In summer, the conditions are hot and dry; in winter, elevations make them subject to severe cold and high winds. Due to the quick changes in the weather, be aware of the danger of flash floods. While this danger is greatest during the summer monsoon season (July through September), flash floods can occur at any time of the year. 
e.	Purpose and Objectives: 
The purpose of the Navajo Area Abandoned Mines Response and Construction Services (AMRCS) contract is to provide cleanup, response, and construction services to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), primarily at former uranium mining-related sites on or within the Navajo Nation (within EPA Region 9 in Arizona and New Mexico) and within the Grants Mining District (located in EPA Region 6 New Mexico).

The selected contractor(s) will be required to comply with OSHA 1910.120(e)(3)(ii) for working on a site with known and characterized hazardous substances. A minimum of 40-hour HAZWOPER training for all contractor personnel working on site is required, and must be able to provide current certifications.

9. DESCRIPTION 
a.	Background: 
Under the authority of Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or Super fund of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA); Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recover y Act (RCRA) and pursuant to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) (40 CFR Part 300); and in accordance with any reauthorizations or amendment s to any of the above named statutes and  new response legislation, the EPA has been delegated the responsibility to undertake response actions with respect to the release or threat of r el ease of, hazardous substances, or pollutants and contaminants, that pose an actual or potential threat to human health or welfare, or to the environment.
b.	Navajo Area Uranium Mines (USEPA Region 9) 
The Navajo Nation encompasses more than 27,000 square miles, spread amongst the Four Corners Region of the USA (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona). The unique geology of the region makes the Navajo Nation rich in uranium, a radioactive ore in high demand after the development of atomic power and weapons at the close of World War II in the 1940s. Approximately four million tons of uranium ore were extracted during mining operations within the Navajo Nation from 1944 to 1986. Many Navajo people worked the mines, often living and raising families in close proximity to the mines and mills. 
Uranium mining and milling activities no longer occur on Navajo lands, but the legacy of these activities remains, including more than 500 abandoned uranium mine claims with thousands of mine features such as pits, trenches, holes, etc., and homes and drinking water sources with elevated levels of uranium, radium and other radionuclides. Uranium and other elements (selenium, arsenic, etc.) associated with mine and mill sites also occur naturally at elevated levels in rock, soil, surface water, and groundwater across the Navajo Nation and the broader Four Corners region. 
USEPA maintains a strong partnership with the Navajo Nation and, since 1994, the USEPA Superfund Program has provided technical assistance and funding to assess potentially contaminated sites and develop a response. In August 2007, the USEPA Superfund Program compiled a Comprehensive Database and Atlas  of all known uranium mines on the Navajo Nation. 
In October 2007, at the request of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, EPA, along with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Indian Health Service (IHS) developed a coordinated https://www.epa.gov/navajo-nation-uranium-cleanup to address uranium contamination in consultation with Navajo Nation EPA. 



In January 2013, these federal agencies, in consultation with the Navajo Nation, completed a five-year effort to address uranium contamination in the Navajo Nation. The effort focused on the most imminent risks to people living on the Navajo Nation. While the last five years represent a significant start in addressing the legacy of uranium mining, much work remains and the same federal agencies have collaborated to issue a second https://www.epa.gov/navajo-nation-uranium-cleanup . The purpose of the second Five-Year Plan is to build on the work of the first plan, make adjustments based on information gained during this period, and plan the next steps in addressing the most significant risks to human health and the environment. 
Although the legacy of uranium mining is widespread and will take many years to address completely, the collaborative effort of USEPA, other federal agencies, and the Navajo Nation will bring an unprecedented level of support and protection for the people at risk from these sites. Much work remains to be done, and USEPA is committed to working with the Navajo Nation to remove the most immediate contamination risks and to find permanent solutions to the remaining contamination on Navajo lands. 
c.	Grants Mining District (USEPA Region 6) 
The Grants Mining District comprises an area of 100 miles by 25 miles that was the primary location of uranium extraction and production activities in New Mexico from the 1950s until late into the 20th century. The Grants Mining District extends along the southern margin of the San Juan basin in Cibola, McKinley, Sandoval, and Bernalillo counties as well as Tribal lands.

Other environmental impacts may have been caused by erosion and leaching of mine waste materials, some of which were deposited into arroyos where it remains to the present-day, and by the reported operation of on-site heap-leach and stope-leaching operations. Few of the legacy uranium mine sites have undergone surface reclamation, and many have physical hazards that remain such as open adits and shafts, as well as uncontrolled waste rock and ore piles on-site.

<div><br /></div>

Therefore, offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information as the Government may evaluate and make a final decision for award solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted by offerors. Furthermore, the Government may determine the acceptability of a proposal based on the initial proposal submitted by offerors. Offerors are required to submit a technical proposal package and a price proposal package.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Technical Package:&nbsp; The evaluation factors that comprise of the technical package are as follows, in no order of particular importance: (1) project experience; (2) past performance; (3) managmeent plan; and (4) schedule. The technical factors are significantly more important than price. As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Price Package:&nbsp; The Government will incorporate the RS Means Pricing book into the contract for the cost of task orders. When evaluating price, the Government will require the offeror to submit the following coefficients for evaluations for the base and four, one-year option periods:</div>

<div><br /></div>

<p>The City Cost Index from the RS Means Book will NOT be applied when pricing task orders.  Any adjustment for location has already been included in the offeror's Bid Factor</p>
<p>The unit prices listed in the RS Means Building Construction Cost Data are bare costs.  Bare cost equals a factor of 1.000, the same as "NET", all other bid factors "MINUS" or "PLUS" will be added or subtracted from the bare cost factor.  A "MINUS" 4% shall be written 0.96, a "PLUS" 4% shall be written 1.040 and "NET" shall be written 1.000.)  The offered bid factors for the base and each option period will be applied to all work items for which a unit price is stated in the Price Schedule that are ordered via task orders in the respective base/option period.</p>

Special competencies will be required for any work involving membrane roofing, asbestos abatement, PCB removal and/or elevator work.</p>
<p>Pre-Construction Task orders may require Pre-Construction Phase Services and shall include, but are not limited to, review and evaluation of the concept, design development and construction document submission for constructability, value engineering or alternate means and methods recommendations, identification of any problems or errors in the design documentation, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, primary cost estimates during design development and construction documents, and development of subcontractor and supplier interest.</p>
<p><strong>Contract Type</strong>:  The expected base contract shall be a single-award indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity job order construction contract (IDIQ JOCC). All task orders placed against the IDIQ JOCC shall be firm-fixed price based on the RS Means pricing structure and contractor bid factors. The ordering activity shall specify whether bonds are applicable to the construction activity for each task order.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Scope of Task Orders</strong>:  The following is provided for informational purposes only. Contractors should be aware that annual budgets are highly variable and the actual quantities and value of work changes annually. Data shows that GSA, Region 8 executes about 50 - 60 contract actions annually to perform minor alterations and repairs that fall within the scope of construction services under the IDIQ JOCC. GSA also executes reimbursable work authorizations on behalf of other agencies for tenant improvement projects. Although construction activities take place throughout the year, a large quantity of these projects typically falls between the months of April and September. The expected average dollar value of projects executed under the scope is about $25,000 with a median dollar value of about $12,500. The majority of task orders are expected to be between $2,000 and $25,000.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Proposal Submission Information</strong>: Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) and the System for Award Management (SAM) are available for use by all Federal agencies. You must be registered with SAM before registering with FedBizOpps. No Federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites. The solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities website (FedBizOpps.gov). FedBizOpps is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. You may access FedBizOpps via the following address: www.fedbizopps.gov. You will then be required to register as a vendor by selecting the "register now" hyperlink. At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company DUNS Number (contact Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 for a free DUNS Number if you do not have one), Your Company Information and Personal Information. It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for any changes and/or conditions. Online Representations and Certification is required in Federal solicitations as part of the bid submission process, thereby eliminating the need to submit a paper copy of Representations and Certifications with each offer. Please enter and maintain your representation and certification information in SAM via the internet at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p><strong>Requests for Information</strong>:  Interested contractors are encouraged to submit any requests for information directly to the Government point of contacts shown in this FBO notice.

<DESC>Synopsis Architect-Engineering (A-E) Services<br />AFCEC Fire Protection<br />CONUS and certain OCONUS locations<br />for The Kansas City District
<p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: These contracts are being procured in accordance with Public Law 92-582, the Brooks Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6 and DFARS 236.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The Architect-Engineer (A-E) contracts are required to support projects assigned to the Kansas City District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers related to the Air Force Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC) projects involving studies, design, design review, and testing requirements for fire protection (suppression systems, alarm systems and life safety) in aircraft hangars and ancillary support or related facilities. Selection of Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDCs) will be based on design criteria described below. Selection of task orders will be based on appropriate selection criteria consistent with the Brooks Act and FAR subpart 36.6.</p>
<p>A target of three firm-fixed-price IDCs will be negotiated and awarded. The total value of all task orders issued will not exceed $9,500,000.00. The synopsis is open to all businesses regardless of size. If the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that fewer or more contracts should be awarded, based upon the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the value of individual task orders, up to the maximum value of each contract. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. Firms that are selected for negotiation of a contract may be required to submit additional information at a later time for use in the evaluation of qualifications for specific Task Orders.</p>
<p>The base ordering period for each IDC will not exceed five (5) years, with the option to extend services by six (6) months. The period of performance for the IDC will begin on the date of contract award and the ordering period will be in effect for the five (5) year base period, along with the additional six (6) months extension of services if the option is exercised. The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDC will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years from date the Task Order is awarded) and will be included in the task order solicitations and negotiated task order award documents. Award of these contracts is anticipated in March 2019.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes for this procurement is 541330 (Engineering Services), which has a small business size standard of $15,000,000 in average annual receipts.</p>

<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: The required A-E Services relate to Air Force Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC) projects involving studies, design, design review, and testing requirements for fire protection (suppression systems, alarm systems and life safety) in aircraft hangars and ancillary support or related facilities. Services may include, but are not limited to <br />fire protection engineering in order to accomplish individual design, design reviews (concept definition thru 100%), and acceptance tests at applicable project locations primarily inside the continental United States (CONUS), but may require work outside the continental United States (OCONUS).</p>
<p>Projects will require a registered Fire Protection Engineer (FPE) preparation and certification of plans, specifications, cost estimates, design analysis and submittals in order to verify the design is in compliance with the fire protection UFC and all applicable criteria. This FPE designer of record (DOR) certification must be submitted with the 100% design submission. Portions of work may include fire protection controls, detection systems, notification systems, and suppression systems to protect personnel, aircraft hangar, aircraft, industrial, and administrative support areas associated with AF hangars.</p>
<p>The FPE will review calculations supporting all fire suppression and fire alarm/detection systems for the project. The FPE may be required to review calculations for systems, features, or elements other than fire suppression or detection, as applicable. Fire suppression system calculations must be reviewed using commercially available computer software. Drawings will be reviewed using Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) software as described in each project and customer specific guidance. The Air Force (AF) Hangar Fire Suppression System Standard Design Drawings and CADD standard is available at (http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/), BIM guideline, and USAF Attachment F, is available at (http://www.wbdg.org/references/). The FPE will review cost estimates with the appropriate level of detail as required by that particular submittal. The FPE will report corrective action recommendations for critical calculations, design errors, interference checks, and omissions that may result in significant impacts to the project execution and costs.</p>
<p>The FPE may be required to provide additional summary evaluations to identify systemic weaknesses in AF criteria, project programing, design/construction practices, and provide recommendations to improve overall AF hangar fire suppression system sustainability and reliability to reduce nuisance suppression system activations.</p>
<p>The FPE may be required to cooperate with and assist the government points of contact and other FPEs involved in development of hangar fire suppression systems criteria and system designs. Results of the FPE design reviews and acceptance tests may be incorporated into system acquisition training guidance for staff engineers.</p>
<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below in descending order of importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion). Criteria a through e are primary and will be evaluated for all offerors. Criteria f, g and h are secondary and will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are essentially technically equal.</p>
<p>a.Specialized experience and technical competence in:</p>
<p>1)Experience in leading fire suppression design, perform detailed studies, design reviews and performance testing requirements of fire protection (suppression systems, alarm systems and life safety) of large body hangars for the Air Force including the Contract Number and the firm's level of effort for the requirement.</p>
<p>2) Experience serving as the government representative supporting the Pre-Final (PAT) and Final Acceptance Tests (FAT) for large body aircraft Hangars for the Air Force in CONUS locations including the Contract Number and the firm's level of effort for the requirement.</p>
<p>3) Experience in leading and conducting site investigation and code analysis for hangars for Air Force fire protection and ancillary systems for occupancy, including the Contract Number and the firm's level of effort for the requirement.</p>
<p>4)Experience performing Air Force fire suppression design, design reviews, Pre-Final (PAT), and Final Acceptance Tests (FAT) for large body hangars in OCONUS locations, including the Contract Number and the firm's level of effort for the requirement.</p>
<p>5)Quality management procedures. The basis of the evaluation will be the description of the firm's quality management procedures in Section H of the SF 330. A detailed quality control plan is not required with this submission but will be required subsequent to award of the contract.</p>
<p>b.Professional Qualifications: Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications in these key disciplines:</p>
<p>1)Fire Protection Engineer<br />2)Mechanical Engineer<br />3)Electrical Engineer<br />4)Architect</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be information provided in section E of the SF 330. The SF 330 shall include a matrix in Section G showing experience of the proposed lead disciplines on the projects listed in Section F of the SF 330. The education, professional registration, certifications, overall and relevant experience, and longevity with the firm will be considered. All disciplines are equal in importance. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed under the capacity criterion below. The lead personnel for each discipline should be clearly identified in section E. Only one resume (the lead for that discipline) will be evaluated for each discipline.<br /><br />c.Past Performance</p>
<p>Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. The Contract Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried for all firms submitting a SF330. In addition to reviewing the offerors CPARS based on team members DUNS numbers, CPARS will be retrieved for the 10 projects submitted in section F of the SF330. In addition to CPARS, the board may seek information on past performance from other sources.</p>
<p>d.Knowledge of local conditions</p>
<p>All projects on this contract will be within the continental United States (CONUS) or certain OCONUS locations. Specific local conditions will be addressed at the task order level not on the base awards.</p>
<p>e.Capacity to initiate work and complete within the time parameters of the project.</p>
<p>The evaluation will consider the availability of an adequate number of personnel. The evaluation will look at numbers listed in Part II of the SF330 to evaluate the overall capacity of the team. Include a Part II form for each firm that is part of the proposed team.</p>
<p>Secondary Selection Criteria. The following secondary criteria will only be used as a tie-breaker among firms that are essentially technically equal. The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The three secondary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>f.Small Business Participation (not applicable to small businesses).</p>
<p>Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), HUBZone small businesses, Veteran Owned small businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort. The greater the participation, the greater the consideration. Large businesses will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with Small and Small Disadvantaged firms in accordance with Public Law 95-507. The basis of the evaluation will be information submitted in Section H of the SF 330. This criterion is not applicable to small businesses.</p>
<p>g.Geographic Proximity.</p>
<p>If necessary responding firms should identify any offices operated in close proximity to the Kansas City District and the contribution these office(s) will make in support of the project.</p>
<p>h.Volume of DoD AE contract awards in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD AE contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months.

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CONTRATOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)<br />Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.

<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com.<br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care.<br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to award a Task Order with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.
This Task Order is being issued to United Parcel Service due to the requirement for using their services by the federal policy issued in accordance with the underlying GWAC IDIQ.
The estimated value of this Task Order is $375,000.
The pricing of UPS services has already been determined to be Fair & Reasonable by the original Contracting Officer.
The justification for the Exception to the Fair Opportunity Process is in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(A). The White River Junction VAMC has been without a contract instrument for this service since the start of FY19 and further delay would impede the facility s ability to perform important and necessary functions.
