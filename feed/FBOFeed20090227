Contract performance will be governed by a performance work statement based on American Correctional Association/Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions.</p>
<p>Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government. Offerors are encouraged to be mindful of the requirements in the performance work statement regarding the residential drug abuse program and the building trades and vocational training program. The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued.

A NEPA analysis will be performed for the proposed contract action. An Environmental Impact Statement may be required prior to award.</p>

<DESC>Introduction
The Joint Improvised Explosives Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), provides the vehicle for the competitive selection of basic and applied research, and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement.  Contracts based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.”  As the issuing agency, JIEDDO will not issue paper copies of this announcement.  Any proposal documents or other materials submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of JIEDDO and its contracting agencies to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  
Awards for submissions under this BAA are planned in Fiscal Years 2009 and 2010.  However, funds may not be available for all requirements under this BAA.  No contract awards will be made until appropriated funds are available from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  JIEDDO reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals in response to this BAA.  JIEDDO will not provide funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  
This BAA will remain open for no less than 180 days from the publication date.  Proposals may be submitted at any time during that period.  At the conclusion of that period, JIEDDO will either extend the submission deadline or publish a new BAA.  See Section I for more detailed information.  
Approach
JIEDDO will use a two-phased proposal selection process for this solicitation to minimize cost and effort of prospective offerors.  Phase 1 will solicit and evaluate proposal quad charts and white papers.  Section VII, below, provides detailed guidance on Phase 1 proposal preparation.  Section VIII provides information on the Phase 1 evaluation process.  Proposals found to have technical and operational merit during Phase 1 will be selected for Phase 2.  Submitters will be contacted with specific instructions for Phase 2, which will consist of technical meetings as well as more detailed presentations and submissions to the JIEDDO acquisition management process.  Subsequent to funding approval, full technical proposals may be requested.  
HBCU/MI and Small Business Set Aside
The Government encourages nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), minority institutions (MI), women-owned businesses, and historically underutilized business (HUB) zone enterprises as well as large businesses and Government agencies to submit proposals for consideration or to join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of the BAA will be set-aside for these special entities because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development in any specific requirement area.  The final determination will be made based on the relevance of the proposal to JIEDDO requirements, individual technical merits of the proposal, and budget constraints within the mission priorities.  To ensure full consideration in these programs, registration in the BAA Information Delivery System (BIDS), described later in this document, requires the appropriate business type selection as well as accurate up-to-date information.  
Limitation of Funds 
The Government may incrementally fund contracts awarded from this BAA as provided by FAR 52.232-22, “Limitation of Funds.”  Contracts awarded to proposals submitted under this BAA are anticipated to be 6 to 18 months in duration.  To facilitate incremental funding, submissions shall include the cost and schedule by a task-phased structure organized by fiscal year (October through September) with clear exit criteria, and shall be inclusive of all work to complete the effort including any options.  It is anticipated that the entire effort will be negotiated with the initial contract award.  
Technical Evaluation Support 
JIEDDO will use contractor support personnel in the review, evaluation, and administration of all submissions to this BAA.  All individuals that have access to any proprietary data shall certify that they will not disclose any information pertaining to this solicitation including any submission, the identity of any submitters, or any other information relative to this BAA.  They shall also certify that they have no financial interest in any submissions evaluated.  Submissions and information received in response to this BAA constitute permission to disclose that information to certified evaluators under these conditions.

2.	Contracting Agency Name:  Any United States Government contracting organization may serve as the contracting agency for this BAA.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Value Concepts Office at Fort Monmouth is soliciting input to determine if there is sufficient Industry - Contractor interest to offer training for Value Engineering Change Proposals (VECPs).<BR><BR>The VECP Clause contained in virtually every contract allows the contractor to submit money-saving ideas to the government and share the savings. The VECP program exists to provide incentive and reward to contractor cost savings initiatives. <BR><BR>If you are a contractor providing supplies or services to the government of over $100,000 per year, you most likely have FAR 52.248-1 referenced in Section I of your contract.  <BR><BR>This clause in your contract allows you to submit VECPs.  VECP is a bit of a misnomer as no engineering is required to submit a VECP.  This clause is a 'suggestion program' of sorts that rewards you (the contractor) for ideas you have.  <BR><BR>Only two conditions apply: <BR><BR>1. The idea requires a modification to your own existing contract to implement (any part of the contract). <BR><BR>2. The idea must save the government money at some point in time.  <BR><BR>For your VECP the government will share savings found on your contract, and if applicable to concurrent contracts, and future contracts  on those as well, for up to 5 years. This is true even if you are not a party to the future and concurrent contracts yourself.  <BR><BR>The Value Concepts Office at Fort Monmouth is considering offering a half day or full day training class for VECPs.  The class would be free of charge to interested Industry - Contractors.  This training will take place in the late spring time-frame.  Interested parties should respond to:<BR><BR>Monmouth-ValueEngineering@conus.army.mil<BR>

The Landsat Data Continuity Contract (LDCC) was awarded to SAIC in March 2008 under Contract No. 08HQCN0006 as a base plus three option years. The Technical Support Services Contract (TSSC) was awarded to SGT, also in March 2008 under Contract No. 08HQCN0005 as a base year, plus four option years years. Both contracts were awarded simultaneously with a base year, plus four option years. Previously, both efforts were combined under one contract, but were separated as two 2008 awards. The USGS intends to exercise Option Year 1 under both contracts to serve as a bridge for a follow-on solicitation that combines the work being performed under both contracts. The anticipated award date for the single procurement is April 2010. This requirement is being issued as full and open in accordance with FAR Part 15 for competitive acquisitions and is subject to the availability of funds. USGS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this announcement. The Government anticipates an award of a performance based, cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract. The period of performance will be for a period of one base year, plus four option years beginning with the date of award. An anticipated release date of the solicitation is on or about July 2009. The NAICS Code is 541513 with a $23 Million size standard. A site visit and pre-solicitation conference may be conducted and will be announced at a later date.
The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the NBC posting system at http://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/login.jsp.

<DESC>RFI FOR REPORTING APPLICATION v003bCURRENT ENVIRONMENTThe Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) is looking for a reporting tool to support several VA applications.  The VA applications provide services that include human resources, medical, payroll, and financial.  Data contained in these systems include financial data, Privacy Act data, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) data.  All information is processed and stored at the AITC on a predominantly mainframe system with both mainframe and web front end accessibility with desktop access only from within the VA firewalls.Examples of data throughput include:	Payroll reports detail a bi-weekly process paying 260,000+ employees.	The payment system processes 50,000 daily payments using a database of 50,000 payees and 175,000 venders.	Current reports stored and used include daily, weekly, bi-weekly, quarterly, and annual, at a minimum.STATEMENT OF NEED AND REQUIREMENTSAITC shall identify an improved solution set for online report storage, indexing, archive, retrieval, management, and secure presentment.A.	Help Menu. Application shall include a robust help menu and entries which are intuitive and detailed for user assistance.  Technical administrators require 24 hour phone support.B.	Certification Standards.  The report application should be accreditable to Certification and Accreditation standards using the requirements set forth in NIST SP 800-37.  C.	Search Scope. Flexible search criteria (as opposed to tightly-defined forms) shall be user-friendly. Searches across all reports for an entire retention period (e.g., one year) shall be available to users. D.	Search Speed. Performance of any search, simple or complex, shall match or exceed current report application's timeframes. E.	Access Speed. Retrieval, view, or export of report data shall match or exceed current report application's timeframes. F.	Conversion (import) into desktop software. Extraction of selected report data into a document, spreadsheet, database, or message shall be available to end users (workstation-based data manipulation is implied). G.	Data Processing.  Data integrity between host (mainframe) and electronic report is essential. H.	Data Transfer.  Any intersystem data transfer shall be protected, at a minimum, through the use of FIPS 140-2 approved encryption algorithms and products.  I.	Workflow & Collaborative Utility (email, SharePoint, etc.).  Report information should be easily exportable to government-used applications such as Microsoft Office products and SharePoint for formatting, manipulation and additional report creation.J.	Reports.  Online reports shall replicate the essential contents of mainframe output without exception. K.	Report Accessibility.  Application shall provide access to reports stored in various formats:  Adobe Acrobat .pdf, ASCII, microfiche, and legacy systems.L.	Product Scalability.  Application shall store from 2-1,000+ reports per month and allow new reports to be added.M.	Production Availability. Current reporting system has reports available in application within of 2-7 days after production.  New application should match or exceed current timeframes. N.	Version Control. Multiple versions of the same report, sometimes from the same date, shall be made available. O.	Report Retention. Reports shall remain available for real-time use for a minimum of three years with near real-time restoration for previous years.P.	Archive Format & Reliability. Aged reports shall be archived and restored in real-time or near real-time. Q.	Printing Alternatives. Multiple formats (forms, raw text, Adobe Acrobat, MS Word, etc.) shall be available to end users. R.	User Community.  All users with access to the payroll and human resources data shall be U.S. citizens with a valid and current background investigation or mutually agreed upon U.S. Government or Department of Defense (DoD) level background clearance and shall operate within the borders of the U.S.A. or its territories.  Users shall protect the payroll and human resources system data in accordance with the Privacy Act and Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S. Code 1905) and the Unauthorized Access Act (18 U.S. Code 2701 and 2710).  S.	User Authentication.  Currently the authenticator in use by the VA is password authentication.  The report application shall require user authentication via a unique UserID and password, at a minimum, with only three login attempts before lock-out.T.	Session Termination.  In accordance with VA Handbook 6210, policy requires that open sessions be terminated after 10 minutes of inactivity.  Re-establishment of the session may take place only after the user has provided the proper password.  After 10 minutes of website inactivity, the user should be notified that the session is being terminated.  If the user does not respond, the session is terminated and the user must re-enter their credentials in order to regain system access.U.	SmartCard:  The VA is in the process of instituting SmartCard identification which will require the use of an access card inserted into a card reader to access equipment within the VA.V.	Report-level security. Access shall be restricted by reports, roles, and organization, in addition to other criteria.W.	Audit Trail, Reports, Logs.  The report application shall provide, at minimum, an audit trail of time-stamped events such as user identification, station identification, removals, success or failure of access attempts, logs/reports of security-relevant events, and security actions taken by system administrators or security officers. Audit reports shall be regularly and automatically produced and made available to security officials.  Audit logs shall be retained for a minimum of one (1) year.X.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.
This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, or a Request for Quotes. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to receive feedback from industry in regard to the following and is in support of market research. Information is being gathered to determine if more than one supplier has the capability to fully meet the Government's stated requirements.
The US International Trade Commission (USITC) is seeking contractor services capable of providing comprehensive global monitoring of news coverage and Internet citations of the USITC, its Commissioners and products, evolving international trade matters, and other topics of interest to the Commission. The contractor must provide daily delivery via e-mail of relevant clips and/or Internet citations (Internet citations must include the URL for the citation). Clips/URLs will be distributed among the Commission and its staff for informational purposes. The services required include:  (1) continual monitoring of global media and Internet sites; (2) identification of relevant clips/citations; (3) daily electronic delivery via email of identified items to the USITC’s Office of External Relations by 9:30 a.m.; and (4) Internet-based tools that will:  (a) allow USITC staff to format selected clips/citations into a report or newsletter that can be distributed electronically to USITC Commissioners and staff for both desktop viewing and Blackberry viewing (NOTE: we require a Blackberry edition that is as clean and devoid of extraneous Internet codes as possible, and interested contractors must address this issue in their response); and (b) measure and analyze coverage.

The contractor must monitor global coverage of the USITC and identified trade issues (which will evolve regularly) based on key words and phrases developed in consultation with USITC staff and must be willing to refine the key words and phrases as necessary. Monitoring must cover the print or electronic editions of daily newspapers, including the following specific sources: The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times (London), The Washington Post, The Washington Times; wire services; magazines; business journals; trade publications; industry newsletters; broadcast organizations (radio and television); and Internet blogs and online fora.  Search terms will vary and evolve regularly. 

Customer support is an important element of these services. USITC is looking for contractors that provide access to human customer support. Contractors must ensure that clips/citations do not violate U.S. copyright laws and are asked to include in their response information about actions they take to address copyright protection.

The contractor must provide an Internet-based tool to enable USITC staff to format clips/citations into an electronic newsletter, or similar product appropriate for use as a newsletter, deliverable via email to USITC Commissioners/staff.  The USITC requires delivery options for desktop viewing of the electronic newsletter or similar product and for Blackberry viewing of the electronic newsletter or similar product. The Internet-based tool needs to allow analysis by ITC staff of coverage of the USITC and the creation of reports or other presentations based on that analysis.
Responses to this RFI should include: Company name, address, email, telephone number, points of contact, CAGE code, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), business type and small business type (if applicable) as registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and a brief qualifications and capability package (not to exceed 10 pages). To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly handled. The government anticipates award of a Fixed-Price contract to a single contractor, for five (5) one year periods (Basic plus four (4) Option Years). This is a continuing requirement and as the government proceeds with preparation for solicitation and contract, we are exploring use of different contract types to attain the most cost effective rates.
This is an RFI only and all information received will be for marketing purposes. Telephone inquiries, questions, and/or comments will not be accepted. Submissions and any related communication must be in writing and submitted in electronic format. Hardcopy packages will not be accepted. All communication will be posted through FedBizOpps for this RFI. Please provide the requested information no later than 2:00 P.M. (EST) 11 March 2009, via email to the POC named below.

<DESC>General:

This Sources Sought Notice is a Request for Information (RFI) and for planning purposes only.  This is not a pre-solicitation or solicitation announcement and no contract will be awarded from this Notice. The Department of State will not answer any questions regarding this market research. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Notice. 

RFI Focus:
	
The Department of State is interested in determining the availability of potential small businesses that have the capabilities to perform Global Support Services (GSS). The GSS program will be performed outside the continental United States.

Background:

The Department of State GSS will provide support services for nonimmigrant and immigrant visa operations at United States consulates and embassies abroad, including but not limited to public inquiry services, appointment services, fee collection services, biometric enrollment services, document delivery services and data collection services.

GSS will replace the patchwork of existing user-pay agreements currently in place around the world. More than 150 posts are supported by user-pays services of some type, processing over 95% (8.25 million in FY 2008) of all visa applications. Although user-pays services have been successful in helping posts meet their workload and improving customer service, such partnerships have been entered into on a piecemeal basis.  It has led to a multiplication of business processes and limited the Department’s ability to effectively launch new procedures and requirements.

All GSS services will have to comply with security, legal and practical requirements unique to each region, country and post; these services must also reflect the realities and cultural and social norms of various overseas environments, including the national laws and infrastructure of the host country. GSS services and the management information generated by such services must be provided in a manner compatible with the information technology systems used by the Department of State.  GSS will require onsite management and oversight of overseas operations. 

GSS service providers must be able to perform the full range of services outlined below, in any region of the world, although the package of services offered will vary by location. The services may include but will not be limited to: providing contractor owned-operated service locations based on geographical distribution of demand for overseas services; collection of application data for visas etc. (including maintenance of local-language version of application forms and instructional materials); quality assurance on data collected from visa applicants; capture of required biometrics; scans and capture of data from supporting documents; collection and secure delivery services for issued travel documents; collection of fees on behalf of the United States Government; information services; application tracking and status reporting.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice.  This notice is a mechanism for obtaining feedback from industry in regard to the general requirement stated below.  THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Rather, it is a market research tool to determine potential sources prior to the issuance of a solicitation.  The Government is not obligated to, nor will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.  

The United Stated Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations Headquarters, Science and Technology (S&T) Acquisition Division is seeking interest from potential sources in supporting the DHS S&T Directorate, Human Factors Division’s (HF) Indicators of Intent to Use Improvised Explosives (IEDs) available in Blogs to support the Counter-Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) Program.  

DHS plays a major role in fulfilling Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)19, “Combating Terrorist Use of Explosives in the United States,” including national policies, strategies and implementation plans for the prevention and detection of, protection against, and response to terrorist use of explosives in the United States.

Terrorists have repeatedly shown their willingness and ability to use explosives as weapons worldwide.  There is ample intelligence to support the conclusion that they will continue to use such devices to inflict harm. The threat of explosive attacks in the United States is of great concern considering terrorists' ability to make, obtain, and use explosives, the ready availability of components used in IED construction, the relative technological ease with which an IED can be fashioned, and the nature of our free society. 

It is the policy of the United States to counter the threat of explosive attacks aggressively by coordinating federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal government efforts, and collaborating with the owners and operators of critical infrastructure and key resources to deter, prevent, detect, protect against, and respond to explosive attacks, specifically with regard to applying techniques of psychological and behavioral sciences, such as social network theory, in the analysis of potential threats of explosive attack.  As the use of the internet by terrorists has increased, blogging and message boards have played a substantial role in allowing communication among those who would do the United States harm.  In order to better counter the use of IEDs, it is necessary to identify speech acts in near to real-time which proceed the decision by terrorists to use an IED.

In support of this requirement, the following tasks may be required:  1)  meeting with DHS representatives to further refine requirements under this effort.  In particular, DHS representatives will provide additional information regarding the types of information that needs to be collected from blogs and message boards (amount of discussion about IED technology, depth of discussion about IEDs, support for use of IEDs, etc.).  2)  developing objective, systematic data collection and retrieval techniques to gather data on a near real-time basis from blogs and message boards.  Data will be collected at multiple, pre-determined times to evaluate the transmission of information over time, and should include metrics for determining the impact factor and usage patterns of the blogs and message boards.  3)  identifying blogs and message boards utilized or favored by groups that engage in violent or terrorist activity to include in the study.  Blogs and message boards must be representative of various characteristics of the larger populations of interest. and  4)  collecting quantitative and qualitative data from the bloggers to evaluate such issues relating to knowledge of the preparation and execution of violent activities, including IED attacks.  

Contract deliverables may consist of the following:  1)  a Documented Research Plan which articulates the sampling method, data collection instruments, etc. acceptable to DHS customers and HF personnel; and  2)  Final Report and Evaluation consisting of a detailed written report of the blog evaluation to include all research findings and their practical implications for predicting and countering violent behavior and IED attacks.  Also included within this deliverable would be a brief document or checklist containing practical guidance for analysis and assessment of the vast amounts of blogging and message board data.  

Personnel would be required to possess the requisite skills and technical background necessary to successfully complete the tasks described herein, including, but not limited to, the knowledge of:  1)  communication research and theory;  2)  blog and message board sampling and usage methodologies and techniques;  3)  IED terminology and uses;  4)  terrorist research with regard to choice of attack methods and communication patterns; and  5)  social science research methods (e.g. quantitative and qualitative methods, survey design).  Also required is experience in:  1)  conducting large scale social science research projects focused on evaluating the effect of communications on behavior; and  2)  translating research findings into practical guidance for policy makers, communications experts, and analysts.  At least one staff member assigned to this project shall possess a Ph.D. in a social science related field.  

The potential North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes that may be determined to be applicable to this requirement are:  519130, “Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals” and 541720, “Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities.”  So that we may better determine capabilities for this prospective procurement, we request that you submit a copy of your company’s capability statement.  Note:  Capability Statements should be no more than five (5) pages).  Any material submitted should be at the unclassified level.  Capability statements should be sent via e-mail to Intent.IED@dhs.gov by 5:00 pm Eastern Time on Friday, November 28, 2008, with the title of the project in the subject line.  Please be advised that all public information available about this requirement is provided in this notice.  DHS personnel are not available to answer further questions.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid, Request for Quotation or request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this Request for Information will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and Performance Specifications.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information.<BR><BR>Description.  The US Army is surveying the GPS vendor community to identify and assess the availability of technologies to meet a potential requirement for a secure hands-free wrist-mounted lightweight military Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver that every Soldier can wear. A military GPS receiver is defined as one capable of receiving and processing the Precise Positioning Service (PPS) signal by use of crypto-variable keys for operation in a secure keyed mode. Current military GPS receivers, Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR) and Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR) are too big and cumbersome and have many features that the ground user does not need and or use.  Likewise, not every Soldier has the ability to know their location and direction at all times.  In addition, a Soldier/Leader using a military GPS receiver has to take their hands off of the weapon system and eyes off the enemy or battlefield in order to view grid coordinates and or direction to the enemy as indicated on a display screen.  Military units and individual Soldiers procure commercial (non-secure) receivers to obtain basic functions such as position, direction, waypoint tracking, waypoint marking, and route planning.  Soldiers typically strap these receivers to their wrist with tape or by some other field expedient means. The wrist mounted device is intended to supplement the use of existing military GPS receivers (PLGR and DAGR) as well as provide military GPS capabilities to those dismounted users not already equipped with existing military GPS receivers.  This requirement is targeted to ground and air-mobile users with minimal positioning and navigation functional requirements.  <BR><BR>The Army mission calls for the use of small, lightweight secure military GPS receivers. Currently it is not feasible for every Soldier to carry a DAGR or a PLGR due to size, weight and power requirements. However, it is an urgent requirement and of safety concern that every Soldier have a military GPS capability to quickly obtain and report their current position and direction to the enemy without taking their hands off their primary weapon.  In addition, Soldiers on patrol need the ability to accurately report and mark waypoints for caches and any suspected IED. This capability will make our Soldiers more confident with regard to their Situational Awareness and will contribute significantly to the units overall lethality.  Improved positioning determining capability at the Soldier level will also expedite coordination of MEDEVAC requests and reduce fratricide and soldier/team location uncertainty. <BR><BR>The United States Army CECOM Contracting Center is issuing this RFI to identify potential sources of technologies that can meet the government's projected performance and delivery requirements for a hands-free wrist-mounted secure military GPS receiver.  This RFI will also determine available alternatives and assess industry readiness and production capacity that may lead to the delivery of affordable military GPS systems as stated above. <BR><BR>System Characteristics.  Please Contact the Technical Point of Contact listed below for a document which outlines potential definitions of the Systems Characteristics, Environmental conditions and Support Requirements for the military GPS receiver as stated above. <BR><BR>Interested parties with technologies which they believe may address the potential requirement are requested to submit a response to this RFI on or before 4pm on (date - 30 days from posting date).  Responses will be evaluated with regard to the ability of proposed technologies and or products to meet the requirement and the cost/schedule/performance benefit tradeoffs involved in bringing the technology to production.  Responses will also aid the government's feasibility assessment and determination of a likely acquisition strategy to meet the potential requirement.<BR><BR>Respond to: Carolyn Weickert, (732) 532-6135, carolyn.weickert@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: US Army CECOM Acquisition Center - DAAB07 ATTN AMSEL-AC, Building 1208, Fort Monmouth NJ 07703-5008<BR><BR>Place of Performance: US Army CECOM Acquisition Center - DAAB07 ATTN AMSEL-AC, Building 1208, Fort Monmouth NJ 07703-5008 <BR><BR>Technical Point of Contact: Kevin Lee, (732) 532-8428, Army PM GPS Bldg 283, Fort Monmouth NJ 07703, kevin.f.lee@us.army.mil <BR>

The current stock is a rigid, monolithic piece that extends eleven (11) inches to the rear of the receiver group, giving the M16A4 a total length of 40 inches.  While the current stocks remain crucial for deliberate aimed engagement, it becomes an obstacle when combined with the increased bulk of improved body armor.  The improvement to the body armor has made it difficult for the M16A4 Service Rifle to accommodate the various body shapes and sizes of the individual Marine.  The desired solution should have the capability to reduce the length of the weapon in order to accommodate the variation in shooter size and should not degrade the reliability of the current M16A4 Marine Corps Service Rifle.  

Upon receipt of all responses to this request for information, PM Infantry Weapons intends to conduct an industry day with all respondents (date and time to be determined).   

  
Detailed draft requirements are:
- The butt stock shall be collapsible (Threshold = Objective). 
- There shall be four (4) position stops in the butt stock for adjustment (Threshold).  
- There shall be six (6) position stops in the butt stock for adjustment (Objective).   
- Reliability shall be equal to the standard M16A4 Marine Corps Service Rifle (Threshold), reliability should be improved from the standard M16A4 Marine Corps Service Rifle (Objective).

Responses to this RFI should not exceed five (5) pages and must contain the following information: a capability statement which includes the commercial availability of the item listed, the vendor’s ability to meet the stated specifications noted above, pricing information and any required lead time for purchase

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Issue                    Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) No.: DE-PS36-09GO99023The Department of Energys (DOE) Golden Field Office (GO) intends to issue, on behalf of the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Industrial Technologies Program (ITP), a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled Information and Communication Facility Energy EfficiencyTitle IV of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 directs DOE to support research to increase the efficiency of information and communication technology and improve standards.The goal and scope of the proposed FOA are broadly described in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), Title IV - Energy Savings in Buildings and Industry, Subtitle D  Industrial Energy Efficiency, Section 452 ENERGY-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES PROGRAM, Section 453 ENERGY EFFICIENCY FOR DATA CENTER BUILDINGS and in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Title IX  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, Subtitle B  Distributed Energy and Electric Energy Systems, Section 922 -  HIGH POWER DENSITY INDUSTRY PROGRAM.There are two broad areas of interest. Each proposal must address only one of these areas of interest. The areas of interest are:A.     Information and Communications Technologies Research & Development For Energy EfficiencyThe energy used by our nations vital telecommunications and data centers is growing at an alarming rate.  As information technology and communications services continue to slowly converge, the data center and telecommunications industries face increasingly similar challenges to control the power usage of their microprocessors or servers and supporting power and cooling systems. The electricity consumed in data centers and telecom systems is already three percent of the U.S. total and growing rapidly. In the face of growing global energy demand, uncertain energy supplies, and volatile energy prices, innovative solutions are needed to radically advance the energy efficiency of these systems, which represent the engine of the American economy today. Enhanced energy efficiency in the central offices and data centers supporting our information, communications technology (ICT) systems will enhance U.S. energy and economic security.Proposals for research and development in the following areas are sought:1.  Equipment Hardware and SoftwareComputing hardware and software are the functioning components of server-based data and telecommunications centers and largely determine power and cooling requirements. Achieving high levels of energy performance will require novel approaches to the design and management of these hardware and software systems.  The key theme and approach in this area is to minimize heat generation.  Thus, energy will be saved by developing novel systems that generate less heat (i.e., new electronic circuitry which will use less energy by increasing chip output per unit of power used) or are impervious to heat, or by the use optics only.     These include, but are not limited to: Develop all-optical systems to increase energy efficiency. Advance ultra-low power circuits like multi-phase clock asynchronous circuits to increase energy efficiency Utilize ultra-efficient nano-electronic circuitry, including nano-based information storage devices, wires and graphene-based systems.  The latter is expected to make possible the replacement of silicon in future electronic devices, and may make possible the incorporation of spintronic devices in future server-based ICT systems.  Create hardened electronic equipment which can withstand temperature, humidity and particulate conditions outside the boundary of current generation electronics.  Thus server-based systems can operate without air conditioning in environments worldwide, even high temperature environments. 2.  CoolingCooling is believed to account for a third of all power consumed by information technology, telecommunications, and data centers.   The cooling of server-based telephone central offices and data centers can be made more energy efficient by the following, but are not limited to:  Create advanced component level cooling technologies Develop mitigation techniques to reduce the probability of failures associated with free cooling.  Identify and create effective uses of low-quality waste heat generated.3.  Power Supply EfficiencyData and telecommunications centers require large quantities of electricity to be conditioned, converted, and delivered to the diverse components, including servers, switches, routers, and hard drives. The power supply chain can include electricity purchased from the grid, backup power, onsite-power generation, switchgear, UPSs, power distribution systems, rack-level and unit-level power supplies, and power management technology. Traditionally, data centers have used AC power distribution systems and telecommunications centers have used DC power.  The R&D proposals for power supply energy efficiency may address the following, but are not limited to: Research and develop high-efficiency power conversion circuits which optimize server-based data center and telecom equipment.  Develop special purpose chips, multiphase clocking, ternery/other processing modes, lower-power chips (noted in part under hardware and software). Research the use of optical switching to eliminate many conversion steps & losses (Also noted under hardware and software). Conduct RD&D of superconducting components. Research the use of piezoelectrics to incorporate into micro-mechanical air conditioning for point of load cooling Efficiency optimized control systems for power conversion.Each proposal MUST include organizational participants capable of and experienced in 1) research, 2) manufacturing the technology proposed, 3) bringing the technology to the end user through sales and marketing, and 4) serving as an end user of the technology proposed. Each R&D project will be funded for maximum of three (2) years, with one or more budget periods. B. Demonstration and Field Testing of Highly Energy Efficient and Pre-commercial Technologies in Data Center or Telecommunication Facilities DOE is interested in field testing and independently validating the energy performance of pre-commercial technologies that show the potential to improve energy efficiency while not compromising data center or telecommunication reliability.   The demonstration sites will be early adopters of the technologies and must be willing to share information about the cost-benefit results of the field-tested technology projects so as to encourage more rapid market acceptance of the technologies.   Accordingly, DOE will work with the demonstration teams to develop case studies of the technology projects using measured and verified results so as to reduce market and technology risk.The applicants must show a plan for the technologies to be demonstrated and the adoption of other best energy management practices to improve a data/ telecommunication centers energy intensity performance (energy consumed for a given level of useful computational work) by more than 25 percent and have a Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency (DCIE = IT energy / total facility energy usage) of 0.80 or greater. New and innovative technologies that are not currently widely commercial and that improve the following parts of a data center or telecommunication facility will be considered for DOEs cost sharing: Information Technology (IT) Optimization.  This could include, but not be limited to: server virtualization, data storage and networking optimization schemes, methods in connecting multiple data centers (e.g., cloud computing) or any technology and IT optimization system that will result in less heat generation for a given amount computational work load. Energy efficient electrical power distribution and supply.  This could include, but not be limited to, more energy efficient electrical power supply to the IT or telecommunication equipment through new power transformation and back up technologies by reducing overall power distribution supply and IT system energy losses. Energy efficient cooling schemes.   This could include, but not be limited to, more energy efficient cooling of IT/telecommunication equipment by more optimally delivering and/or controlling cooling to IT equipment with, for example, wireless sensors or IT systems that require less cooling while not compromising equipment lifetime. Distributed generation or alternative power technologies.  New innovative combined heat and power or renewable energy technologies that are optimized for data center/telecommunication facilities and reduce overall source energy consumption and carbon emissions are desired to be demonstrated. Technology demonstrations must be able to be widely replicated in other data centers throughout the United States and not be niche applications.The demonstration teams must be willing to cooperate with DOE to perform an independent performance validation and to create case studies. Demonstration teams must also be willing to conduct public tours of the demonstration site(s) for up to 2 years after the technology demonstration case study is prepared. Partnerships between the technology development teams and Federal facilities building new or retrofitting existing data center/telecommunication facilities, as well as other host sites, should be formed. C. General InformationDOE envisions awarding multiple financial assistance/grant awards on a competitive basis. These awards will require cost shares in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Details about cost share requirements will be included in the FOA along with the details of technical areas of interest, proposal preparation instructions and application merit review and evaluation criteria. DOE plans to release the FOA in March, 2009. The FOA will be available for viewing at Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov) and at the DOEs Industry Interactive Procurement Systems (IIPS) or e-center (https://e-center.doe.gov). Applicants are strongly encouraged to register at these sites to receive notification of announcements posted by DOE Golden Field Office. When the FOA is released, applications will only be received through Grants.gov.In anticipation of the FOA being released shortly, there are several one-time actions prospective applicants must complete in order to submit an application through Grants.gov (e.g., obtain a Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, register with the Central Contract Registry (CCR), register with FedConnect, register with the credential provider, and register with Grants.gov).  Due to the likelihood of a short response period, interested applicants are strongly encouraged to ensure these requirements have been met. Detailed information on the DUNS and CCR process is presented at http://www.grants.gov/GetStarted.  Applicants may use the Grants.gov Organization Registration Checklist at http://www.grants.gov/assets/OrganizationRegCheck.pdf to guide them through the process.  Designating an E-Business Point of Contact (EBiz POC) and obtaining a special password called an MPIN are important steps in the CCR registration process.  Applicants not yet registered with CCR and Grants.gov, should allow at least 21 days to complete these requirements.  It is strongly recommended that the process be started as soon as possible. If your organization does not have a DUNS number, go to the Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) online registration located at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform/displayHomePage.do  to receive a number free of charge or call 1-866-705-5711. The Central Contractor Registration (CCR) collects, validates, stores, and disseminates business information about the Federal Government's trading partners in support of the contract award, grants, and the electronic payment processes. To see if your organization is already registered with CCR, check the CCR website located at http://www.bpn.gov/ccrinq/scripts/search.asp.  You will be able to search CCR by using either your organizations DUNS Number or legal business name.   If your organization is already registered, take note of who is listed as the organizations E-Business Point of Contact (E-Business POC). This person will be responsible for registering in FedConnect. To register in FedConnect, go to https://www.FedConnect.net/FedConnect/ or contact the FedConnect Helpdesk at support@fedconnect.net Please note that the system functionality of FedConnect requires organizations to be registered with the CCR before registering with FedConnect. (FedConnect Quick Start Guide:https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/PublicPages/FedConnect_Ready_Set_Go.pdf ) If your organization is not registered in CCR, go to the CCR Website at www.ccr.gov and select the "Start New Registration" option to begin the registration process. Please allow up to 7 days for processing of your registration which includes the IRS validating your Employer Identification Number (Taxpayer Identification Number or Social Security Number).  The organizations E-Business POC will be designated during the CCR registrations process.  A special Marketing Partner ID Number (MPIN) is established as a password to verify the E-Business POC. The DOE will not entertain questions at this time. Once a FOA has been released, a submit questions feature will be defined.DISCLAIMER This Notice is issued so that interested parties are aware of the DOEs intention to issue this FOA.  DOE reserves the right to change the requirements of any proposed FOA, issue a FOA involving only a portion of the elements listed, or not issue a FOA at all.  Any of the information contained in this Notice is subject to change.  Any amounts proposed for funding are subject to the availability of funding.

<DESC><p>On January 9, 2009, Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) posted a "good faith" notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). In this notice, FPI proposed to manufacture boxer shorts for the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Boxer shorts are classified under FSC 8420, Underwear and Nightwear, Men's. At this time, UNICOR produces brown undershirts under FSC 8420. FPI also produces shorts and trunks, under FSC 8415, Clothing, Special Purpose. The NAICS code for boxer shorts can be either 315211, men's &amp; boys' cut and sew apparel contractors or 315221, men's &amp; boys' cut and sew underwear and nightwear manufacturing. FPI currently manufactures products in those NAICS codes. Therefore, FPI did not consider this to be a "new product."</p>
<p><br />FPI received no comments from any interested party regarding this proposed production, within the 21 days allowed as stated in the January 9, 2009 FedBizOpps notice. Therefore, boxer shorts will be classified in FSC 8420, Underwear and Nightwear, Men's and will not be considered a "new product" for FPI.</p>
<p>Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI's Board of Directors. Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534. Attention: SBDM Branch.</p>

<DESC>Contract No. 08HQCN0006 was competitively awarded to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) for the development, integration and test, delivery, and follow-on technical support of the Flight Operations Segment, excluding the Mission Operations Element and the Data Processing and Archive Segment, excluding the UPE and SAE. The contract was awarded March 7, 2008 as a CPAF, base year contract, plus three option years. Due to budget issues, the USGS is re-directing SAIC to change a portion of the technical direction to utilize a modified existing Landsat ground systems architecture, as opposed to developing a new Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) data processing and archive segment. The contract will follow the revised technical direction and a revised Option Year 1 will be awarded, effective May 1, 2009 as a CPFF award. At the conclusion of the option year, a new single award for this effort and technical support services at EROS will be awarded. Due to budget issues, insufficient time for knowledge transfer, inadequate amount of time to conduct acquisition planning and the need to continue support of critical systems, the USGS intends to award the revised option year to SAIC while a new competition is being conducted for the follow-on contract. This notice is for informational purposes only. Request for Proposal (RFP) is not available. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this action.

<DESC><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has authority to place a priority rating on its contracts for industrial resources, in accordance with the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulation (15 C.F.R. Part 700), to support its Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) program in order to ensure the timely completion of this hurricane protection system by June 2011 for the greater New Orleans area.  On 29 October, 2008, Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency determined the HSDRRS program as a critical infrastructure protection and restoration activity  <BR>						<BR>The HSDRRS program has been authorized the use of a DO priority rating.  In that capacity, this notice is to inform contractors that this is a DO-N7 rated orders will be iussed under the authority of the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulation which is administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  A copy of the regulation can be found at www.bis.doc.gov/dpas.<BR><BR>A free on-line training course is offered at the Defense Acquisition University (DAU), http://www.dau.mil.  The course is CLC043 Defense Priorities and Allocations System.<BR>		<BR>The priority rating on the USACE order indicates that:<BR><BR>1.	 The order supports an authorized national defense program.  The DO indicates that this program is vital to the national defense, and the N7 specifies the program (critical infrastructure protection and restoration).<BR><BR>2.	 This rated order contains a statement that it has been certified for national defense use and you are required to follow all the provisions of the DPAS regulation (15 C.F.R.  700).<BR><BR>3.	The order contains an authorized written or digital signature.<BR><BR>4.	The required delivery date is indicated in the order.	<BR><BR>Receipt of a rated order requires the contractor to do four things:<BR><BR>     1.  Mandatory Acceptance/Rejection: A company in the Unites States must accept and fill a rated order for items that the company normally supplies.  A company may not discriminate against rated orders in any manner, such as by charging higher prices or by imposing different terms and conditions than for comparable unrated orders.  The existence of previously accepted unrated orders or lower rated orders is not sufficient reason for rejecting a rated order.  A company may reject a rated order for delivery on a specific date if unable to meet that date.  However, the company must inform the customer of the earliest date on which delivery can be made and offer to accept the order on the basis of that date.<BR><BR>      2.  Customer Notification Requirements: A company must accept or reject a rated order and transmit the acceptance or rejection (in writing or electronically) to the customer placing the order within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of a DO rated order.  If the order is rejected, the company must give reasons in writing (not electronically) for the rejection.<BR><BR>     3.  Preferential Scheduling: A company in receipt of a rated order must schedule operations, including the acquisition of all needed production items, in at timely manner to satisfy the delivery requirements of each rated order<BR><BR>    4.  Extension of Priority Ratings: A company who receives rated orders must in turn place rated orders with its suppliers for the items needed to fill the rated orders.  This continues from contractor to subcontractor to supplier throughout the entire supply chain.<BR><BR>USACE intends to ensure that the HSDRRS stays on schedule.  Accordingly, the New Orleans District Contracting Division will present a briefing for interested industry members regarding the DPAS priority rating on 25 March 2009 at 2:00 pm in the District Assembly Room, 7400 Leake Ave., New Orleans, 70118.-3651  Please contact Nancy Tullis at (504) 862-1604 or via email Nancy.Tullis@usace.army.mil to attend the presentation which will be approximately one and half hours in duration.<BR><BR>Participation in this critical national defense program will help protect and enhance our nations vital interests.<BR>

PRODUCT CONFORMANCE:  The products provided shall meet the salient characteristics of this description, conform to the producer's own drawings, standards, and quality assurance practices and be the same product offered for sale in the commercial market.  The Government reserves the right to require proof of such conformance.

The item(s) shall be packaged and packed in accordance with the latest revision of ASTM D 3951, Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging.  In addition, the abrasive grain shall be packed tightly within the container to provide strength and stability during pallet stacking.  The box/container shall have sufficient structural strength to prevent any type of edge crush, collapse, breakage or any compromise to the contents or the load during pallet shipment.

Phone: 610-832-9585, Fax: 610-832-9555, Web site: www.astm.org, e-mail: service@astm.org.

NOTE: Should the ordering quantities dictate pallet shipment, the following shall apply:

Palletization:  The shipping (transport) containers shall be palletized. The pallets shall be 48-inch length x 40-inch width, general purpose, four-way entry, flush stringer, and double-face non-reversible pallets.  The palletized load shall not exceed 2500 pounds in weight. The palletized load shall not overhang the pallet deck board edge by more than 1 inch and shall not exceed 53 inches in overall height (including pallet). Less than half pallet loads or loads shipped by small package carrier in acceptable transport packing need not be palletized. When less than full but more than a half pallet is used, the palletized load shall utilize proper bracing and/or reinforcement to ensure that the load can withstand two additional loads placed on it.

Stacking:  A FIBERBOARD CAP SHALL BE PLACED OVER THE PALLET PRIOR TO STACKING.  A load-stacking test shall be performed once, at the beginning of the contract, for each different unitized or palletized load configuration. A fully palletized load shall be tested utilizing a total stack of three palletized loads, with all the proper bracing and/or reinforcement necessary to perform the test. There shall be no evidence of damage to the pallets, shipping containers or products when stack is tested on the rigid surface for a minimum of 24 hours, in compliance with all the National and Local Safety Regulations. The pre-tested palletized load configuration shall be duplicated using the same packaging materials, pattern, number of shipping (transport) containers, and procedures consistent throughout the duration of the contract. Palletized loads shall be stable and safe when handled with mechanical equipment by qualified personnel.

Materials:  All lumber used inside or outside a shipment shall be bark free. No used wood pallets with repaired components or stringers will be acceptable. All wood pallet stringers shall be manufactured from hardwoods.  Pallets manufactured of materials other than wood, shall conform to all the requirements specified herein.

Unitization:  For the purpose of this requirement, the assembled group of containers or items in a single load that can be handled as a unit throughout the distribution system. Unitization encompasses, but is not limited to, consolidation in a container, placement on a pallet or load base having forklift capability, or securely binding together. Shipments should be considered for unitization where appropriate or specified.

Unitization of pallet load:  The palletized load shall be unitized and secured to the pallet to insure that the load arrives intact without product damage. The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load. Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements. A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping, and/or, by steel or nonmetallic strapping. When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping. As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load. A palletized load shall be capable of protecting the products against damage in a multiple handling, transportation, and storage environment having distribution warehouses with rack systems that support the load/s overhead of warehouse personnel.

Notice of special requirements for shipment to all countries that have endorsed the IPPC Guidelines for treatment of non-manufactured wood packaging:  The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) has approved and published on March 15, 2002, “Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade”. Countries endorsing the IPPC Guidelines are found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/swp/. Clause D-FSS-468 requires non-manufactured wood pallets and other non-manufactured wood packaging material used in shipments destined to IPPC compliant countries require the appropriate wood treatment. Additionally, shipments delivered to DOD distribution facilities or freight consolidation points for eventual delivery to or through EU/IPPC countries shall comply with applicable DLA Regulations and Procurement Letter PROCLTR 02-17.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to award several contracts under BAA1582-09-BAA-0006 in several specific research topics all pertaining to Advancing Image and Geospatial Analysis (AIGA) Program.  The AIGA effort will conduct research and develop software to solve some of NGA’s pressing and hard geospatial intelligence problems relating to target identification, scene characterization, change detection, as well as pattern discovery and analysis of competitive hypotheses.  AIGA focuses on critical mathematical and scientific research to develop advanced capabilities that will significantly enhance data exploitation methods and solve these problems. 

The purpose of these contracts is to develop research objectives in four research topics.  The Basic and Applied Research Office of the NGA InnoVision Directorate has a continued need for new approaches to the AIGA problem.  AIGA 2009 consists of four topics: “Framework for Characterizing, Classifying and Tagging Background, Anomalies, and Targets”, “Compression and Restructuring of High Dimensional Multimodality Datasets,” “Spectral and Spatial Fusion of Hyperspectral Data and Other Imaging Modalities,” “Framework for Anticipatory Analysis of Human Individuals and Groups.”  All awards will be based on merit competition.  The total period of performance for these contacts is no more than three years and the emphasis will be on the proposed work in the base period.

PART II:  PRICE

(1) The price quote shall be a separate volume from your technical quote and must include:

a.	Your pricing (to include labor categories and fixed hourly rates) based on Contract Line item 0001, utilizing any and all discounts.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD:

The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price purchase order to the responsible offeror whose quotation represents the best value to NIST, price and other factors considered. 

1)	Technical, Key Personnel and Past Performance are equal in value, and when combined is more important than price. 
2)	The Government reserves the right to award to other than 
      the lower-priced offer for better technical capability
      and/or better performance records.  
3)	The total evaluated price must be reasonable, and any
      additional expense must be justified by a corresponding
      value for technical merit, or an expectation of greater 
      quality of performance.  
4)	The Contracting Officer will exercise the trade-off 
      analysis among the factors, leading to the “best value” 
      decision.
	5)    The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Factor 	1:  Technical Approach; Factor 2: Key Personnel; Factor 3:  Past 	Performance; and  Factor 4:  Price.

Factor 1-Technical

Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical proposal that demonstrates the degree of offeror’s understanding of fulfilling the requirements outlined in the Statement of Work and the contractor’s ability to perform the requirements.

 
Factor 2- Key Personnel

Evaluation of this factor will be based on the individuals proposed as key personnel who will be responsible for fulfilling this requirement	as evidenced by submitted resumes, education, previous experience in similar requirements, references, etc.

Factor 3- Past Performance 

The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s and, if appropriate, its 
proposed subcontractors’ past performance information to determine its relevance to the current requirements and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. In assessing the offeror’s past performance, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work.  The Government will evaluate past performance by contacting the references selected at random or a specific reference identified by the offeror. It should be noted that the Government may use past performance information obtained from other sources than the sources identified by the offeror and that 	the information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best overall value determination.  The Government will assign a neutral rating to offerors with no relevant past 
performance.

Factor 4- Price  will be evaluated for reasonableness in consistency with the technical approach. The price evaluation will determine whether the proposed costs are realistic, complete and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements.  

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESULTANT PURCHASE ORDER:

Clause 52.212-4 and clause 52.212-5 (with appropriate fill-ins as noted above) will be the only terms and conditions for the resultant purchase order.  These clauses are required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to be included in each commercial item purchase order.

PAYMENT TERMS FOR RESULTANT PURCHASE ORDER:

No advance payments will be authorized.  The Contractor may only submit an invoice for Item Number 0001 after the Contractor delivers them to the Government and the Government thereafter accepts them.

INQUIRIES REGARDING THIS RFQ:

Potential Offerors shall submit any questions regarding this RFQ in writing to cheryl.coxen@nist.gov no later than Monday, March 9, 2009.  Oral inquiries will not be entertained.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 for commercial items, with a notice of intent to issue a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Federal News Service, Inc., 1000 Vermont Ave, NW FRNT1, Washington DC 20005-4903, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The resulting contract will be awarded on a sole source basis to the Federal News Service, Inc., for the justification here stated: “The two month service agreement sought with the Federal News Service will provide the necessary time to properly compete and award a new contract (a base year with several option years).  The DMC Contracting Activty is in the process of conducting a full and open competitive procurement for similar services that will result in a long term award for the requreid services. Delays with this procurement have been caused by 1) failure to obtain contractual authority in the form of a contract extension via the Army’s Center for Contracting Excellence, through which the previous contract was awarded.  That extension was sought in order to prepare a new RFP, evaluate proposals, and award a new contract; and 2) confusion on the part of the Contracting Officer Technical Representative on how to rectify the situation.  An award to another vendor would cause great disruption in services and additional costs which are unlikely to be recovered as a result of competition. Moreover, this contract award is limited to only that short timeframe needed to complete a proper full and open competition. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
      Informal forum with the Ombudsman:. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
      Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<DESC><p>Specifications for Laser Flash Thermal Diffusivity Instrument</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>1. The instrument must have a temperature range of -125 to +1100&#61616;C with two user-exchanged furnaces.<br />Justification: This is the temperature range required for characterization of the materials of interest.<br />2. The instrument must be equipped with a two-stage rotary vacuum pump and be vacuum-tight to at least 1 x 10-2 mbar.<br />Justification: <br />For testing materials that are oxidation sensitive. If oxide layers form on the sample and/or the material microstructure changes due to oxidation, the measured thermal diffusivity/thermal conductivity will be greatly affected. It is therefore imperative that the instrument be vacuum-tight in order to evacuate and backfill with a pure inert gas to reduce the partial pressure of oxygen in the system.<br />3. The system must be vertical with the laser mounted below the sample so that it shoots from the bottom and the detector must be located above the sample. In addition, the detector must be a bottom-mounted InSb with a wave guide from the sample to the detector and be located no more than 6 inches from the sample.<br />Justification: Many materials are extremely sensitive to the heat flux and can be easily damaged. It is therefore imperative that the laser energy be kept to a minimum. The specified configuration allows a high detector sensitivity with low laser pulse energy. Systems that shoot from the top and direct the sample energy to a side-mounted IR detector via a mirror are not acceptable because of the high heat losses.<br />4. The system must be top-loading and equipped with a motorized furnace hoist.<br />Justification: Top-loading systems are more convenient to work with because of the ease of sample placement and because they are more robust. The motorized furnace also contributes to ease of operation.<br />5. The instrument must be equipped with water safety switches.<br />Justification: This feature automatically shuts down the system in case the cooling water supply is interrupted, thus preventing damage to the furnace.<br />6. The system must conform to Laser Class I.<br />Justification: Because of safety considerations, the system must be equipped with interlocks, so that the laser will not fire when the furnace is open, i.e. the system must conform to Laser Class I.<br />7. The instrument must be capable of testing samples under oxidizing, reducing and inert atmospheres, as well as under vacuum.<br />Justification: It will be necessary to test many materials under a variety of atmospheres. It is therefore required that the system function properly under the specified atmospheric conditions.<br />8. An alignment laser must be supplied with the instrument.<br />Justification: The alignment laser permits easy realignment after system repair or exchange of major components. <br />9. The system must be equipped with a combination laser pulse mapping device/finite pulse correction software model which will allow accurate measurement of extremely "fast" samples.<br />Justification: The measured thermal diffusivity of so-called "fast" samples (combination of thin and/or high thermal diffusivity) must be corrected for the finite pulse width of the laser. In order to do this accurately, the pulse form of the laser must be accurately mapped with each shot and the experimental data corrected using a sophisticated finite pulse correction model. This is therefore a critical system component. The system must have a laser pulse mapping device and finite pulse correction software model. <br /><br />10. The temperature range of the system must be expandable to -125 to +500&#61616;C by adding only a user-exchangeable low-temperature furnace, LN2 cooling system and MCT detector.<br />Justification: Work for the system may include thermal diffusivity/thermal conductivity measurements at subambient temperatures. It is therefore required that the system be immediately expandable to cover the temperature range of -125 to 500&#61616;C by adding only a user-exchangeable furnace, LN2 cooling system and MCT detector. System modification is not allowed. Further, the sample temperature rise must be measured by an IR detector and not a thermocouple. Systems that utilize thermocouples to measure the sample temperature rise are not acceptable because of the slow response time and contact problems between the thermocouple and sample.<br />11. The instrument must contain an automatic sample changer for at least 3 samples of varying geometries and types, e.g. square, round, rectangular, liquid, laminate, etc. <br />Justification: Testing will involve many different types of materials and, therefore, sample geometries and types will vary. Efficiency will be increased greatly by testing at least 3 different configurations of samples in one run.<br />12. A holder for 25.4 mm diameter samples must be delivered with the instrument.<br />Justification: Testing will involve many low-density and inhomogeneous materials. In the case of the inhomogeneous materials, a larger sample size is required in order to obtain representative results. For low-density materials, a thicker sample is sometimes required for accurate thermal diffusivity measurements because of the surface roughness (depressions, pores, etc.). Beyond a certain point, as the sample thickness is increased, the diameter must also be increased to avoid two-dimensional heat flow. It is therefore imperative that a holder for large diameter samples be supplied for this system.<br />13. A fiber sample holder must be available for the instrument. <br />Justification: Future work may include measurements on fibers. Therefore, a fiber sample holder must be available from the manufacturer. <br />14. A laminate sample holder must be available for the instrument. <br />Justification: It may be required to carry out measurements on anisotropic materials in which the thermal diffusivity is required in both the in-plane and cross-plane directions. In the case where the material is available only in thin layers, measurement of the in-plane thermal diffusivity requires the laminate sample holder. Therefore, this sample holder must be in the program of the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Software</p>
<p>1. The software must allow operation of the instrument in the fully automatic or manual mode.<br />Justification: Generally, the software will operate in the fully automatic mode, in many cases overnight or over the weekend. In some cases, however, the system will be operated in the manual mode to allow optimum operator interaction. Therefore, the software must operate in both the manual and fully automatic modes.<br />2. The software must contain a wizard for selection of the best model.<br />Justification: This feature will aid in selecting the best model for a particular set of operating conditions.<br />3. The software must contain mathematical models which correct for sample heat loss on both the rise portion and/or trailing readings of the experimental data.<br />Justification: Depending upon the material type and particular test conditions, heat loss corrections must be carried out either on the rise portion or trailing readings of the curve. Therefore, the software must contain mathematical models that allow heat loss correction on the two sections of the curve independently.<br />4. The software must contain finite pulse width correction models, which utilize the measured pulse form data acquired for that particular shot.<br />Justification: In some cases, there will be testing of "fast" samples, requiring correction of the data using a finite pulse model. For optimum finite pulse width correction, the model must utilize experimental pulse form data.<br />5. The software must have the capability of correcting the experimental data for finite pulse width and heat loss (radial and facial) simultaneously (based on a non-linear regression routine and the modified (proprietary) Cape-Lehman model).<br />Justification: Generally, it is advisable to carry out both finite pulse width and heat loss corrections simultaneously on the same set of data. Therefore, in many cases this capability will be required in order to obtain optimum results.<br />6. Two- and three-layer models as well as a contact resistance model must be contained in the software. In addition, these models must be capable of simultaneously correcting data for finite pulse width and heat loss.<br />Justification: In some cases, there will be testing multi-layered samples. There may be a need to characterize the development of contact resistance between two layers as a function of temperature. Therefore these software models are required. Optimum results are obtained if the models correct for finite pulse width and heat loss simultaneously. Therefore, these are essential features of the required models.<br />7. The software must contain a model for computation of the specific heat.<br />Justification: In some cases, there will be calculating the specific heat of certain materials using this instrument. Therefore this model is a required component of the software package.<br />8. The software must contain a temperature recalibration routine.<br />Justification: The thermal diffusivity of many of materials is a strong function of temperature. Therefore, small errors in the measured sample temperature can translate into large errors in the thermal diffusivity. For this reason, the software must contain a routine to recalibrate the measured sample temperature based on experimental results obtained using temperature calibration standards. <br />9. A kinetics software package must be available from the manufacturer.<br />Justification: The transport properties of materials are generally extremely sensitive to small microstructural changes. Therefore, thermal diffusivity data utilized in kinetic software can be an excellent tool for characterizing transitions in many materials. The manufacturer must have available a kinetics software package, which can read and evaluate thermal diffusivity data.</p>

<DESC>CONTINUATION PAGE  PRE-BID QUESTIONSINTERIOR FINISHES PH21.      NOTE #6 on page G1001 states all work to be done during normal business hours whenever possible, but certain areas of work may need to be done after hours with the approval of the COTR. Can you please clarify as to what areas are designated for after hours work or should the entire project be bid for work during normal business hours?  Please reference drawings, specification section 01 00 00 and amendment for information on phasing and hours of work. 2.      Sheet AF101 is the only notation to Phasing in this project, is the contractor to create his/hers own phasing plan and incorporate such plan in the project schedule or will the VA provide the phasing plan to us? All areas will require some phasing and will have to be coordinated with the VA COTR.  Please reference drawings, specification section 01 00 00 and amendment for information on phasing and hours of work. 3.      Will hard wall barriers only be required at the areas shown on the drawings and the balance of the barriers to be 6 mil plastic? If not can the VA please provide the additional areas for hard wall barriers?  Reference 01 00 00 1.8 for updated Infection Control and barrier requirements. 4.      Detail 1/AF602 shows the temporary hard wall barrier detail being composed of steel stud, " Melamine laminated plywood and then covered with the 6 mil plastic, then caulked to the existing ceiling. Can the walls be erected with a sill seal at the top track and then tape all the seams at the ceiling area within the barricaded space? This would eliminate the need for the caulk joint at the ceiling and therefore reduce costs for replacing the ceiling tiles that have caulk applied to them.  A sill seal with tape at the top track is acceptable as it still prevents passage of dust particles. 5.      1/AF102 shows room 2C129 removing the Grid/ACT, can this be done during normal business hours and will the kitchen remain open during the construction and if so what are the ICRA requirements for protection of the equipment and surrounding areas?

Does this section only use those projects listed in Factor 1 or can we put other reference names and projects in this location?  If so, is there a limit of reference names we can submit and do we just submit reference names or also project names?  This section is to identify projects of the same scope and requirements of this solicitation in order to evaluate the Contractors experience in working within a similar environment and working conditions.

There is not blocking depicted here.  Is plywood full height required to match W5 or additional strips.  Please define.  The blocking is to be provided at the top of the 1/2 high walls for wall types W5, W6, W7, W8.  The arrow was supposed to point to this at wall types W7 and W8.

There is a cost difference for both the material and shipping.  Please confirm.  Light weight plaster is acceptable as it will be painted.57.	Is this project Tax exempt.  This item is in the front ends but refers to "applicable" taxes to which there is a degree of interpretation.  This is a tax exempt project, meaning that the General should not change any taxes to the government in connection with this contract.  58.	Are there building permit requirements?  No.  Again this is covered as "applicable" in the specifications.  We have found one piece of information from Denver that would suggest that this building would be excluded from permitting.  Can you confirm this?  This is a federal facility and exempt from permitting.59.  Confirm that Door and Frame type D are HM.  Typically we see these as aluminum.  The track detail appears to be a typical aluminum ICU door.

Document Type:  			Request for Information (RFI)
Release Date:				February 20, 2009
Response Date:	March 5 at 4:30 p.m. local time via e-mail to  Contracting Specialist
Contracting Office Address:  	Food and Drug Administration, Tara Hobson, Contract Specialist
Description:  	FDA Sentinel Initiative
RFI:	

This is a Request for Information (RFI) and is not a Request for Proposal/Request for Quotation (RFP/RFQ) in accordance with FAR 15.201(e).  This information is being sought for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  No official solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of a solicitation.  If in the future a official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this RFI will be included on the source list   No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  

Purpose:

The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that have the capability and qualifications to perform activities to support the planning and development of the FDA’s Sentinel Initiative.  FDA is interested in evaluating and building upon models already developed by other organizations (e.g., academia, industry, other Federal agencies) in the fulfillment of this effort.  FDA may consider soliciting services for a base year and four option years using an ID/IQ task order contract vehicle.

RFI Submission Instructions:

FDA will not award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDA’s use of such information.  Responses will be separated from, and have no bearing on subsequent evaluations of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal RFP.  Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice.  Proprietary information is not being solicited.  Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such. Responses will be reviewed only by FDA personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.

Background:

In May 2008, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the FDA Commissioner announced the Sentinel Initiative.  The Sentinel Initiative is a long-term effort by the Agency to create a national electronic system for monitoring product safety.  The Sentinel Initiative is intended to augment the Agency’s existing post-market (primarily passive) safety surveillance systems and to allow the Agency to actively gather information about the post-market safety and performance of its regulated products. 

As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable the Agency to capitalize on the capabilities of multiple, existing automated healthcare data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, administrative claims databases, registries, or others) to augment the Agency’s current surveillance capabilities. The Sentinel Initiative will enable queries of disparate data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included.  Questions would be sent to appropriate, participating data sources, who in turn would, in accordance with existing privacy and security safeguards, evaluate their data and send results for Agency review.  

The Sentinel Initiative is a response to various calls for this type of effort from the Agency.  In September 2005, the HHS Secretary asked the Agency to expand its current system for monitoring medical product performance and to explore the possibility of working with multiple automated healthcare data systems to augment the Agency’s current capabilities of identifying and evaluating product safety information.  The Secretary recommended that the Agency explore creating a public-private collaboration as a framework for such an effort, leveraging large, automated healthcare databases.  

In 2006, the IOM issued a report, entitled The Future of Drug Safety—Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public.  Among other suggestions, this IOM report recommended the Agency identify ways to access other health-related databases and create a public-private partnership to support safety studies.  

In 2007, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007  (FDAAA).  Section 905 of this statute calls for the HHS Secretary to develop methods to obtain access to disparate data sources and to establish an active post-market risk identification and analysis system that links and analyzes safety data from multiple sources. The law sets a goal of access to data from 25 million patients by July 1, 2010, and 100 million patients by July 1, 2012. The law also requires the Agency to work closely with partners from public, academic, and private entities.  The Agency views its Sentinel Initiative as a mechanism through which some of the requirements mandated in this legislation can be carried out.
  
The Sentinel Initiative is a long-term effort that must proceed in stages. The initial stage of the Sentinel Initiative has allowed the Agency to further refine the requirements and develop the scope.  The Agency has funded 8 contracts to support this initial stage.  In addition to this ongoing contractual work, there are many ongoing activities in the public and private sector that will inform the Sentinel Initiative.  The Agency has hosted a series of meetings with various stakeholder groups, to include other federal agencies; data sources and environments; academics and experts; patient, consumer, and provider groups; and IT vendors.  In addition, in December 2008 a public workshop was held to discuss the Sentinel Initiative with the following objectives:

•	To provide an update on the current status of the Sentinel Initiative and allow for comment from all stakeholders 
•	To discuss potential governance models and their implications 
•	To discuss approaches to ensuring continued involvement of all stakeholders as the initiative evolves 

Future efforts will provide specific deliverables that would be integrated with what is learned from contractual work already ongoing to inform the Sentinel Initiative, as well as with other ongoing activities in both the public and private sectors to further understand the feasibility and utility of these data and methodologies primarily for active medical product surveillance.  In addition, the FDA would seek to undertake new activities to support the Sentinel Initiative including test queries, methodology development, testing and implementation support projects, proof of concept development, and technical assistance.  

Examples of tasks of interest that might be awarded under this task order contract may include but not be limited to: 

1)	Formulate an approach for selecting marketed regulated products and specific outcomes for routine surveillance.

2)	Develop, apply and/or evaluate advanced methodological approaches to safety signal detection, signal strengthening, and signal validation in automated healthcare data sources for regulated products during the postmarketing period.

3)	Formulate an approach for confirmation of signals/hypotheses generated by active surveillance of automated healthcare data sources for marketed regulated products. This task may include observational studies requiring diagnosis and exposure confirmation via medical record review or other means.  

4)	Evaluate data model characteristics pertinent to postmarket safety analysis of automated healthcare data.

5)	Identify or develop risk communication tools to facilitate responsible dissemination of findings from the queries evaluated.

6)	Develop training materials and provide training to FDA staff to ensure that staff have a full understanding, proficiency and confidence in the advanced methods and models developed under a given contractor task.

Responses shall be submitted addressing each part as follows:  

Part A. Capabilities and Technical Experience – Provide a capability statement describing the ability to perform activities to support the planning and development of the FDA’s Sentinel Initiative consistent with the example tasks described above. This statement should include, but is not limited, to information about the following topics:
 
•	The respondents’ ability to perform signal validation by accessing full-text medical records.  
•	The range of marketed regulated products within the respondent's automated healthcare databases for which they have the ability to conduct active surveillance. 
•	The respondents' ability to reliably identify active participation in health plans that populate their automated healthcare databases.
•	Whether the respondent's data sources utilize a particular data standard. 
•	The periodicity within which new data is incorporated into the respondent's automated healthcare databases and accessible for analysis, as well as the time frame within which the respondent is able to provide results for a given query

Part B. Technical and Management Approach - Provide a capability statement describing how your company would engage in performing activities to support the planning and development of the FDA’s Sentinel Initiative. 

Part C. Cost Estimate - Provide a cost estimate for the services (i.e. hourly rates, hours/days) and the number of hours in the performance of activities to support the planning and development of the FDA’s Sentinel Initiative.

<DESC>This is Modification 2 to the synopsis entitled Crew Robotics Avionics and VehicleEquipment Contract which was posted on January 27, 2009. You are notified that thefollowing clarifications are being made:As stated in the January 27, 2009 synopsis, multiple IDIQ contract awards are anticipatedfor the follow-on CRAVE competition.  At least one award will be made to an educationalor nonprofit institution under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(3) as comtemplated bythe provisions of FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) which states that "full and open competition neednot be provided when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source orsources in order to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, ordevelopment capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution."As was performed under the original CRAVE competition, NASA/JSC is again considering theapproach of using two separate solicitations to fulfill the intent in the aboveparagraph.  With this procurement approach, an "Unrestricted" solicitation would beissued for a response from industry and a "Restricted" solicitation would be issued for aresponse from academic and non-profit institutions.In addition, it is again contemplated that an IDIQ contract structure will be used forthe follow-on CRAVE contracts, where both Firm Fixed Price and Cost Plus Fixed FeeDelivery Orders may be issued within the IDIQ contract structure.This synopsis modification is being issued by NASA to solicit input from industry on thefollowing:(1)  A procurement approach of using two separate solicitations for the follow-onprocurement.(2)  The types of delivery orders that can be issued under the CRAVE follow-on contracts(example: Firm-Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, etc.)(3)  Potential incentives on performance under the follow-on contracts, which may includefee structure.(4)  Simplifying the acquisition process for the follow-on procurement.All comments and questions pertaining to this synopsis modification must be submitted inwriting via e-mail by March 5, 2009.  Correspondence for the CRAVE acquisition should besubmitted to the CRAVE e-mail address at JSC-CRAVE@mail.nasa.gov.  Telephone comments orquestions will not be accepted.The due date for responses is extended to March 5, 2009.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunitieshome page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation andany amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy ofthe solicitation and amendments (if any).

<RESPDATE>082809

<DESC>Introduction
The Joint Improvised Explosives Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), provides the vehicle for the competitive selection of basic and applied research, and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement.  Contracts based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.”  As the issuing agency, JIEDDO will not issue paper copies of this announcement.  Any proposal documents or other materials submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of JIEDDO and its contracting agencies to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  
Awards for submissions under this BAA are planned in Fiscal Years 2009 and 2010.  However, funds may not be available for all requirements under this BAA.  No contract awards will be made until appropriated funds are available from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  JIEDDO reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals in response to this BAA.  JIEDDO will not provide funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  
This BAA will remain open for no less than 180 days from the publication date.  Proposals may be submitted at any time during that period.  At the conclusion of that period, JIEDDO will either extend the submission deadline or publish a new BAA.  See Section I for more detailed information.  
Approach
JIEDDO will use a two-phased proposal selection process for this solicitation to minimize cost and effort of prospective offerors.  Phase 1 will solicit and evaluate proposal quad charts and white papers.  Section VII, below, provides detailed guidance on Phase 1 proposal preparation.  Section VIII provides information on the Phase 1 evaluation process.  Proposals found to have technical and operational merit during Phase 1 will be selected for Phase 2.  Submitters will be contacted with specific instructions for Phase 2, which will consist of technical meetings as well as more detailed presentations and submissions to the JIEDDO acquisition management process.  Subsequent to funding approval, full technical proposals may be requested.  
HBCU/MI and Small Business Set Aside
The Government encourages nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), minority institutions (MI), women-owned businesses, and historically underutilized business (HUB) zone enterprises as well as large businesses and Government agencies to submit proposals for consideration or to join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of the BAA will be set-aside for these special entities because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development in any specific requirement area.  The final determination will be made based on the relevance of the proposal to JIEDDO requirements, individual technical merits of the proposal, and budget constraints within the mission priorities.  To ensure full consideration in these programs, registration in the BAA Information Delivery System (BIDS), described later in this document, requires the appropriate business type selection as well as accurate up-to-date information.  
Limitation of Funds 
The Government may incrementally fund contracts awarded from this BAA as provided by FAR 52.232-22, “Limitation of Funds.”  Contracts awarded to proposals submitted under this BAA are anticipated to be 6 to 18 months in duration.  To facilitate incremental funding, submissions shall include the cost and schedule by a task-phased structure organized by fiscal year (October through September) with clear exit criteria, and shall be inclusive of all work to complete the effort including any options.  It is anticipated that the entire effort will be negotiated with the initial contract award.  
Technical Evaluation Support 
JIEDDO will use contractor support personnel in the review, evaluation, and administration of all submissions to this BAA.  All individuals that have access to any proprietary data shall certify that they will not disclose any information pertaining to this solicitation including any submission, the identity of any submitters, or any other information relative to this BAA.  They shall also certify that they have no financial interest in any submissions evaluated.  Submissions and information received in response to this BAA constitute permission to disclose that information to certified evaluators under these conditions.

<DESC>The following is additional information, questions, and clarifications for the Request for Qualifications for Solicitation No. 1443N2000090400.
All responses must be received by 4:00 p.m. MST, March 12, 2009 at the following address: 
Via courier- National Park Service; Attn: Rebecca Bizier, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, Colorado 80228
Via US postal service - National Park Service, Attn: Rebecca Bizier, PO Box 25287, Denver, CO 80225-0287
Questions:  Below are questions received regarding the request for qualifications and  responses.  Please forward additional questions to Rebecca Bizier at Rebecca_Bizier@nps.gov.
Question 1:  How many hard copies do you want and do you want an electronic version submitted? 
Response 1: Please submit only one hardcopy to the address provided above.  Electronic submissions will NOT be accepted.
Question 2:  You state, "Submission of any additional supporting material is encouraged, but only to the extent that it graphically (via drawings and photographs) and substantiates the relevant project work specifically described on SF330. Additional information should not exceed 20 double-side pages." To clarify, is the 20 page limit in respect to Part H - Additional Information of the SF330 Form, and if so, does the 20 page limit mean 20 sheets, printed double sided (so 40 pages of content) or 10 sheets, printed double sided (20 pages of content)? If you were not referring to Part H, with the 20-page limit for additional information, is there a page limit for Part H? 
Response 2: The additional information should be provided under Part H and is equal to 40 pages of content.
Question 3:  Please explain the role the economist discipline may play in the contract?
Response 3: Under required disciplines we have listed an economist.  It is anticipated that this discipline would be utilized for economic analysis during planning and compliance phases at a macro level.  Tasks could be related to life cycle costs, modeling, socioeconomic analysis related to impacts on nearby communities or business, etc.  
Question 4: Are you imposing a time history limitation for example projects?  I understand that various federal agencies use different criteria; for some agencies the projects can't be more than 5 years old, for another agency the time limit is 7 years.  Do you have any time limitations?  I assume that we will feature 10 example projects in Section F (maybe with one time limitation), and 20 other projects in Section H (additional information, that may have a different time limitation).  Could you clarify? 
Response 4: We do not have a time history limitation for projects, but are rather more concerned about the performance and relevancy to the type of work requested.  
Question 5: I assume that Criteria 1, 2, and 3 will carry the most important weight for evaluations of proposals.  
Response 5: The technical evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance.
Question 6:  What states do you consider the SW region?  Does it include California?  The NPS regional map does not include this subregion between the Pacific and Intermountain regions.  
Response 6: We consider the SW to be the arid regions - primarily in AZ, NM, NV and arid parts of TX, UT, CO and CA.  The emphasis is more on the conditions, specifically areas that are dominated by ephemeral channels and frequent flash flooding.  Relevant work includes, but is not limited to, work in ephemerals, ephemerals with large sized bedload, desert areas where precipitation runs off quickly with limited infiltration, and flash flooding resulting from relatively small precipitation events with channel scouring.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to extend the due date only for responses to this notice, which was originally posted on 13 February 2009.<BR><BR>This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.   Your response to this Request for Information (RFI) will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and Performance Specifications.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<BR><BR>Description: The Government is conducting market research seeking sources to provide in-theatre logistical support, to include field service representatives and maintainers to support sustainment of the AN/DAS-2 payload and the AN/AAS-53 payload. The payloads provide target-location coordinates, and display continuous high-resolution imagery to the battlefield commander. Performance will primarily be in support of Operation Enduring Freedom / Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) at sites designated by the Commander.  The contractor would provide field and depot maintenance support services to the Payloads.  This support would include, but is not limited to, analysis of field reported problems, correction of system eq<BR> uipment experienced during operational deployments and repair of payloads as needed either on site in Theater or those returned to CONUS for repair. It would also include maintaining the necessary repair parts inventory on-site in both OCONUS and CONUS locations based on historical usage rates to mitigate the degradation of the AN/DAS-2 and AN/AAS-53 systems.<BR><BR>The government is primarily interested in contractors with maintenance operations experienced in Electro-optical sensor payloads maintenance and repair operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom / Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF).   <BR><BR>The government does not own the technical data package for these payloads.   The Government does possess in support of this proposed effort a broad-based performance work statement and technical and performance specs for both the AN/DAS-2 and AN/AAS-53.<BR><BR>System Capabilities:  The AN/DAS-2 operates day and night, detects and recognizes operationally-meaningful targets at survivable standoff ranges, determines range to target, auto-tracks and designates targets for precision-guided standoff weapons, provides target-location coordinates, and displays continuous high-resolution imagery to the battlefield commander. The AN/DAS-2 Payload is comprised of a turret unit and an electronics unit.  The turret unit contains a continuous zoom EO camera, a thermal imager, a visible imager, a laser designator, and an eye-safe laser rangefinder, all packaged within a stabilized gimbal. The AN/AAS-53 is planned to replace the AN/DAS-2 beginning in fourth quarter 2009.<BR><BR>Other Considerations:  Interested sources should use the following planning factors:<BR><BR>Payload Shipment: Payloads will be shipped back to the Contractors facility for major repairs (Depot level repair).<BR><BR>Depot Repair Cycle: Repair cycle threshold should be no more than 40 days with an objective time of less than 30 days.  <BR><BR>Payload factors:  The plan is for eight (8) payloads at a rate of 5.5 hours per day per payload (2007.5 hours per year per payload).<BR><BR>Timelines:  The Government is planning for support of the AN/DAS-2 to begin on or about 1 Jun 2009. Support of the AN/AAS-53 payload is not anticipated before May 2010. <BR><BR>Sites:  Performance will be primarily in support of Operation Enduring Freedom/ Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) at sites designated by the Commander. Plan for simultaneous support to two sites in OIF.<BR><BR>Interested sources are requested to provide a complete description of existing services that will be available for maintaining the AN/DAS-2 and AN/AAS-53 within the timeframe indicated above.  Industry responses must include sufficient documentation to support any claims that their performance will meet the minimum performance capabilities contained herein. Interested sources should describe the level and type of repairs that can be accomplished in the field and when depot level repair is required with payload turnaround time frames. Also identify the numbers of Field Service Representatives (FSRs) anticipated and the role the FSRs would perform in speeding repair of the Payloads.  Identify the types of repairs FSRs can perform in the field as opposed to returning the Payload to the depot.<BR><BR>Interested sources should submit documentation that includes description of existing similar maintenance programs, product brochures and related literature, performance data, photographs, or any other data.  Additionally, industry responses are to specifically include an outline of supply chain considerations with emphasis on any known long lead items that may adversely impact repair.  Any limitations must be addressed along with proposed resolutions to potential maintenance impediments.  Industry responses should also identify critical subcontractor and vendor production capacity along with estimated unit prices assuming a notional 1 Jun 09 award date. <BR><BR>Responses to this RFI are due by 4:00pm EST on 09 March 09.  Technical questions and industry responses are to be sent via email to Monika Herdlick at Monika.Herdlick@us.army.mil<BR><BR>All material submitted in response to this RFI must be unclassified.  Interested parties possessing the capacity to deliver services meeting the requirements outlined above are requested to provide a White Paper describing:<BR><BR>1.  Corporate capabilities, past and current relevant performance information, available facilities and assets  <BR>2.  Technical and management approach for executing a repair operation to include the level and type of repairs that can be accomplished in the field and when depot level repair is required with respective turnaround time frames. <BR>3.  Operation and sustainment considerations.<BR>4.  A cost estimate on a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to meet or exceed the notional requirements outlined above.<BR>5.  An assessment of the associated risks for this program and respective risk mitigation approaches.<BR>6.  Name, telephone number, fax number, street address and e-mail address for Program, Technical and Cost points of contact information.<BR><BR>Commencing mid March 09, the Government may afford interested parties an opportunity to discuss the contents of their White Papers during an industry one-on-one session where it is envisioned the parties will engage in an active information exchange dialogue to aid in the governments feasibility assessment. Additionally, the government may allow interested parties an opportunity to provide a demonstration of their solution.  It is anticipated that any such sessions would not exceed 4 hours and will take place at PM NV/RSTA at Ft Belvoir, VA.

<DESC>Office of Naval Research (ONR)Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)for Payload Implosion and Platform Damage Prediction and Validation Implosion is the sudden inward collapse of a pressure resistant structure. For example, a submerged pressure housing with an internal pressure well below the ambient sea pressure may fail due to the external pressure. Following the collapse, a strong pressure wave is radiated into the surrounding fluid. This pressure wave depends sensitively on the exact form of the collapse. The resulting energetic pressure pulse can potentially damage nearby structures. The Navy requires an improved capability to design and qualify submarine external payloads for implosion avoidance and platform survivability. Validated, user-friendly tools are required that enable the designer to predict implosion effects, especially the magnitude of the resulting shock waves: In particular, the Navy needs 1) a parametric payload design tool for conventional payloads, and 2) a physics-based model for complex analyses. This requires both algorithm and software development, and carefully controlled measurements to validate the software.
