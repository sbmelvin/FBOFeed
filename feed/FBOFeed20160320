<DESC>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR INVITATION FOR OFFERORS TO SUBMIT BIDS. THIS NOTICE WILL BE POSTED FOR A MINIMUM OF 15 DAYS PRIOR TO POSTING OF THE SOLICITATION.
<p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) anticipates issuance of solicitation IFBP01011600001 for the award of a firm fixed-price construction contract for a project entitled ReplaceEmergency Generator at the Federal Prison Camp (FPC Alderson), located in Alderson, West Virginia.</p>
<p>FPC Alderson is a federal correctional facility located on Glen Ray Road, Alderson, West Virginia, 24910. The project consists of furnishing all equipment, materials and labor for the complete construction of the work. See the Statement of Work/Specifications attachment included with the solicitation posting (to be issued at a later date as described herein) for the complete requirements of the work.</p>
<p>The performance period for the project will be 364 calendar days from issuance of the notice to proceed.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 36.204, the estimated magnitude of the project lies between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 238210 with a corresponding small business size standard of $15.0 million.</p>
<p>(NOTE: This range is one of 8 available ranges from FAR 36.204 and is not meant to imply that the project has necessarily been estimated/budgeted to the maximum of the selected range. It merely conveys that the estimate/budget lies somewhere within that range.)</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available approximately on or about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 30, 2016</span></strong>. The solicitation will be distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be made available. The website provides download instructions. Any secure/locked documents (if applicable) uploaded with the solicitation will require an active FBO vendor registration for access. If you encounter problems accessing these documents, please contact the Federal Service Desk at 866 -606 -8220. All future information about this solicitation, including any amendments, will also be distributed solely through this website. Interested parties are responsible for continuously monitoring this website to ensure that they have the most recent information about this proposed contract action.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Any contractor interested in obtaining a contract award with the Federal Bureau of Prisons must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov. In order to qualify for award, your business size metrics information entered in your SAM registration must be less than or equal to the size standard specified above.</p>
<p>Each bidder's SAM registration will be reviewed by the Government to confirm that your business size meets the small business size standard requirement. All bidders are urged to double check their SAM registration and update as necessary, including the size metrics information.</p>
<p>If you have questions about the System for Award Management (SAM), Government procurements in general, or need assistance in the preparation of your bid/proposal, a local Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) may be able to help. The Procurement Technical Assistance Program was authorized by Congress in 1985 in an effort to expand the number of businesses capable of participating in the Government marketplace. To locate a PTAC near you, go to http://www.aptac-us.org.</p>
<p>This is a 100 percent small business set-aside. You must be registered in SAM as a small business (see FAR provision 52.219-1 in the Representations &amp; Certifications section of your SAM registration).</p>
<p>Faith-based and Community-based organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
