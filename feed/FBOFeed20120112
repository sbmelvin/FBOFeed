<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br />The Cannon House Office Building (CHOB), built in 1906, is part of the Capitol Hill campus in Washington, DC and is fully occupied by over 2,000 people. It is one of a series of buildings occupied by the House of Representatives with Member suites, committee support offices and utility support space. The building has five stories plus a full basement. There is a multi-level parking garage in the 'Courtyard' area, housing approximately 300 vehicles, with car access from the south. The total square footage of the building including the parking garage is approximately 800,000 SF. The CHOB is now 106 years old and is experiencing physical deterioration of its systems. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Current construction cost estimates for the renewal range from $450 to $525 million dollars. </span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The AOC will retain a CMa to support the management of the project, as well as a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) to provide both consultation and construction services to complete the scope of work. The scope of CMa services under this proposed contract includes design assistance and preconstruction services, as well as contract options for construction management consulting services for a pre-installation construction phase ('Option 0') and four Option periods of subsequent staged construction, each Option period roughly addressing one of the four 'wings' of the building, and a sixth "closeout" Option, for the purpose of renewing the CHOB for the 21st century.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In addition to matching work phases and proceeding clockwise with each "quadrant" of the building, the Base Contract and Option periods are aligned with Congressional election cycles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, each Option period generally begins with a Congressional election followed by the Members moving amongst offices while design is completed, followed by eighteen months of construction until the next election.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The building will remain fully occupied and operational during the base contract and preinstallation Option period zero ('Phase 0'). The wing under construction during each of the subsequent Option periods will be vacated and made fully available to the CMc, with the other three wings remaining fully occupied and operational.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It is anticipated that the CMa will represent the interests of the AOC while managing the project for the entirety of this contract, including the Base Contract period and subsequent Options.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The services requested of the CMa shall cover a wide range of construction management activities.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The CMa must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project. It is expected that the CMa will assign to such a team, as needed, the following disciplines: Construction Project Managers, Cost Estimators, Critical Path Method (CPM) Schedulers, Commissioning Agents, LEED Specialists, Architects, Multidisciplinary Engineers and design specialists, Subconsultants, Inspectors and other related subject matter experts. Team members must be proficient in the use of computer-based tools and output typically associated with mega projects to include without limitation Microsoft Windows Professional Suite; CPM scheduling software that is Primavera compatible (P6 or the most current update); Microstation Computer Aided Drafting &amp; Design (CADD); and compatible Building Information Modeling (BIM).</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Design and pre-construction services shall include, but are not limited to, review and evaluation of the construction documents for constructability; development of Project Management Plans and Project Execution Plans, leadership and participation in value engineering studies; development of a Commissioning Manual; detailed identification and proposed resolution of constructability problems, errors, omissions, and coordination errors in the design documents; review of CMc project CPM schedule development; construction phasing development; participation in site investigations; performance of cost control and estimating; establishment of document control; and development of subcontractor and supplier interest.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The CMa will function as a collaborative member of the project team and shall be an active participant in design and pre-construction by providing leadership and expertise throughout the design phases. The CMa shall represent the interests of the AOC and will provide AOC with sound and proactive management advice regarding the approach to the project; how to achieve the best value in the work; necessary actions; schedule control; alternative ideas; problem/claim/dispute prevention and resolution; and cost control. The CMa shall have full understanding of the project and its contract documents; and, it shall effectively employ the principles of federal construction contracting and contract administration.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Construction-phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, coordination of regular construction meetings; scheduling support; oversight of the CMc safety program; maintaining construction records including daily logs and monthly reports; proactively identifying, communicating, and managing project risk; controlling construction costs; conducting quality control inspections; management of all management processes; commissioning and acceptance; coordination of facility maintenance staff training; and other services reasonably requested by the AOC.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Most importantly, the CMa shall have complete responsibility for representing the AOC's interests while managing the development and construction of the project. </span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">AOC used the "Construction Management Standards of Practice" issued by the Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) in developing the scope of work. AOC also used CMAA publications titled "Contract Administration Procedures", "Time Management Procedures", "Cost Management Procedures", and "Quality Management Guidelines" that supplement the "Construction Management Standards of Practice" in developing the scope of work. These CMAA documents establish industry standards of service to define the full range of construction management services and Work without limiting the methods and procedures by which those services or Work will be provided. The documents are intended as a guide to the level of Services a CMa shall provide.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br />&nbsp;The AOC is seeking a highly qualified CMc with the experience and capabilities needed to perform pre-construction and design assistance throughout the life of the 13 year contract as well as construction work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The firm for this contract will be competitively selected using a two-step negotiated procurement procedure with oral presentations in accordance with FAR part 15 and sections L and M of the solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CMc shall provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies and equipment (except as otherwise provided) and shall plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all work described in the solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br />The Cannon House Office Building (CHOB), built in 1906, is part of the Capitol Hill campus in Washington, DC and is fully occupied by over 2,000 people. It is one of a series of buildings occupied by the House of Representatives with Member suites, committee support offices and utility support space. The building has five stories plus a full basement. There is a multi-level parking garage in the 'Courtyard' area, housing approximately 300 vehicles, with car access from the south. The total square footage of the building including the parking garage is approximately 800,000 SF. The CHOB is now 106 years old and is experiencing physical deterioration of its systems. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Current construction cost estimates for the renewal range from $450 to $525 million dollars. </span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The AOC will retain a CMc to manage the project, as well as a Construction Manager as Agent (CMa) to provide both consultation and construction management services. The scope of CMC services under this proposed contract includes design assistance and preconstruction services on a fixed price basis during the Base Contract Period, as well as contract options on a GMP basis for construction management construction work for a pre-installation construction phase ('Option 0') and four Option periods of subsequent staged construction, each Option period roughly addressing one of the four 'wings' of the building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A sixth "closeout" Option, also on a firm fixed price basis, is for the purpose of completing whole building commissioning and project closeout. </span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In addition to matching work phases and proceeding clockwise with each "quadrant" of the building, the Base Contract and Option periods are aligned with Congressional election cycles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, each Option period generally begins with a Congressional election followed by the Members moving amongst offices while design is completed, followed by eighteen months of construction until the next election.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The building will remain fully occupied and operational during the base contract and preinstallation Option period zero ('Phase 0').

<a href="mailto:diane.v.dei.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG SCRT - Edgewood</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Edgewood Division intends to negotiate with Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation, Pomona, CA for the final production buy and integrated logistics support (ILS) of the Chemical Biological Mass Spectrometer (CBMS II) under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Joint Project Manager for Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination (JPM NBC CA) has a requirement to procure a maximum of 181 CBMS II units.  The CBMS II is a Component of an End Item (COEI) for the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV).  The CBMS II consists of a Mass Spectrometer Electronics Module (MEM), Sample Introduction Module (SIM), and Soldier Display Unit (SDU).  The MEM uses tandem ion mass spectrometry techniques to analyze both primary and daughter ions.  Analyzing the primary and daughter spectra increases detection confidence and significantly reduces false alarm rates.  The CBMS II detection algorithm detects and identifies a pre-programmed library of chemical agents, while screening out common battlefield background interferents.  The CBMS II is fully automated and self calibrating. The objective of this effort is to fabricate, package, and ship CBMS II hardware in support of the Stryker NBCRV Full Rate Production (FRP) program. The proposed contract will include a 56-month performance period with a 35-month ordering period. Delivery of CBMS II systems and/or spares to Anniston, AL and Auburn, WA respectively, will be required to begin not later than nine months after date of delivery order award. Integrated Logistics Support task orders may be required to update manuals, update training, and maintain compliance with DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) requirements.  The CBMS II is highly specialized equipment and is configured specifically for insertion into the Stryker NBCRV. The Government does not own the technical data package. The CBMS II is a mission critical component of the Stryker NBCRV and the vehicle cannot be fielded without it installed.  Therefore, CBMS II delays directly impact the delivery of Stryker NBCRVs to the Warfighter and impact the ability to perform NBC Reconnaissance missions. As the current producer of the CBMS II, Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation is the only source that can produce and deliver the CBMS II within the Government's program requirements and without substantial duplication of costs for test and integration of a new configuration. This is not a request for proposal.  Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br />"The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</p>

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Trocars on or about May 1, 2012, but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br />Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to, disposable, single-patient use, lightweight and easy to use, low profile housing to allow maximum usable lengths of instrument, universal seal that is compatible with a wide range of instruments, in various lengths (short, regular, long), in diameter sizes ranging from 5mm - 15mm for adults, and pediatric 2/3 mm, and tips (bladeless/optical, bladed/dilating (safety shield feature), and blunt).<br />The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $4,023,451 annually. <br />NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong>Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /></strong>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website. <br />

The purpose of this synopsis is to alert the public (especially the Small Businesses) that the Maritime Administration (MARAD), which is an agency of the United States Department of Transportation, intends to procure construction services for the repairs of its Poland Street Wharf, which is located in New Orleans, LA. The procurement will be set-aside only for Small Businesses. The Invitation for Bids (IFB) and its concomitant construction-ready repair-drawings will be issued around the middle of February 2012; the bid-opening date will be specified in the IFB. In addition, MARAD will utilize a Firm Fixed Price Contract for the above-mentioned procurement. The duration of the project is 90 days (Base Period) with no Option Period. The estimated magnitude of the repairs in terms of physical characteristics (scope) and estimated price range is between $1 million and $5 million. The appropriate NAICS code for this procurement is 237990 with a small business size standard of $33.5 Million. <br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br />MARAD owns the Poland Street Wharf facility, which is located in New Orleans Louisiana. This facility consists of one pier that is made up of five berths, which were built at different times with differing construction techniques. Berths 1 and 2 were constructed between 1923 and 1928; Berths 3 and 4 were constructed between 1941 to 1942 and Berth 5 was constructed in 1940's. Furthermore, Berths 1, 2, and 3 are the permanent lay berths for the Cape Kennedy and Cape Knox RRF vessels. However, Berths 4 and 5 are leased by the Port and used for routine break-bulk cargo operations.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br />An engineering survey to determine and document the condition of the existing structure of all the above-mentioned Berths has been completed by an Architectural/Engineering (A&amp;E) Firm and the survey shows that all the berths are in need of both Critical Repairs and Life Extension project/repairs. Construction-ready repair drawings have been completed for the critical repairs and technical specifications have been completed for the life extension projects based on the survey results.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br />Specifically, MARAD intends to use the above-mentioned IFB to procure only Critical Repair services (not Life Extension Repairs) and they are as follows: <br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br />(a) repairs of cracks, spalls, exposed joints and exposed rebar of Berths 4 and 5 (above-deck repairs); </span></p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Coherent, Inc. of Wilsonville, OR, for the repair of an existing Coherent Verdi V18W Laser System to be used by Sensor Science Division of the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.
<p>The Sensor Science Division of the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) develops and disseminates the national standards of length, mass, force and shock, acceleration, time and frequency, electricity, temperature, humidity, pressure and vacuum, liquid and gas flow, and electromagnetic, optical, microwave, acoustic, ultrasonic, and ionizing radiation.</p>
<p>PML applies its measurement capabilities to problems of national significance through collaborations with industry, universities, professional and standards setting organizations, and other agencies of Government.<br />It is essential that the existing Coherent Verdi V18W Laser System remains fully functional to help meet the mission of the PML. Coherent is the manufacturer and sole source for repair of its equipment. A potential source would have to possess the proprietary knowledge of the Coherent equipment. No other companies have the capabilities or authorized technicians or rights to repair or maintain the Coherent Laser System.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 811219, with a size standard of $19.0 M or less.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by Wednesday January 27, 2012 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to BD Biosciences, 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA 95131-1807.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch (GMBB), investigators in the Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch (GMBB) use molecular genetics techniques to identify and characterize genes involved in the normal development and function of many tissues. Additionally, researchers seek to identify disease-associated gene alterations and to understand how these genetic defects contribute to a range of human diseases, including anemia, cancer, and immune disorders. To accomplish their goal, they study the genetics of blood cells, cells of the immune system, and epithelial cells. They are particularly interested in the study of stem cells, which have the dual capabilities of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple mature cell lineages. GMBB investigators also use yeast cells as a model system to study genome replication and factors that affect genome stability and aging.</p>
<p>NHGRI/GMBB are currently using BD Biosciences FACSAria flow cytometer, which has 9-color capability and allows the user to get more information per cell from smaller sample volumes which saves time and money. This instrument is also critical for clinical applications in which the samples are rare and/or have very low cell numbers to work with. NHGRI is procuring a service contract on the FACSAria, which is both necessary and most cost effective due to the high cost of maintenance and upgrading without such an agreement. This instrument is extremely sensitive and requires multiple visits by the field engineers each year to adjust the lasers and the flow cell, which only the company can do. BD Biosciences is the sole manufacturer of the flow cytometer that requires service and can ensure the supply of spare or replacement parts which are unique to the FACSAria. BD Biosciences is the only provider that can supply instrument software revisions along with preventative maintenance inspections, technical telephone consulting and unlimited on-site service visits. No other sources is authorized to provide maintenance service to this system, must be a authorized BD Bioscience engineer or technician.</p>
<p>The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 811219 and the associated small business size standard is $19.0 Million Per Annum. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-55 (January 3, 2011). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by January 15, 2012 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2012-056-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell.

<CONTACT>Hunter A. Tjugum, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014358780, Email hunter.tjugum@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Diatome US Joint Venture, 1560 Industry Road, Hatfield, PA, 19440, for the purchase of new 3View Diatome Diamond Knife, 1.5mm (6); Ultra Trim 45 (2); Ultra Diamond Knife, 35deg, 3mm (1); Ultra Diamond Knife, 45deg, 3mm (1); 8.0mm Histo Knife (2); and Ultrasonic 3.0mm Oscillating Diamond (1).</p>
<p>NINDS has a requirement to perform Electron Microscopy (EM) to resolve the ultrastructural anatomy of neuronal circuits in order to understand how they perform computations. Because neuronal axon and dendrite morphologies are intertwined in three dimensions, serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) is used to repeatedly image the face of a tissue block and then remove the surface of the block with a diamond knife, thereby building up a series of images of the three-dimensional structure of the tissue sample. Ultrathin sectioning using diamond knives is a necessary step along the path to acquiring high-resolution datasets using SBEM. The EM samples will be gathered to perform large-volume 3D reconstructions of neuronal circuits using SBEM. The atomic sharpness of diamond knives acquired by Diatome US Joint Venture will be critical to achieve a repeatable target width of section thicknesses less than 30 nanometers.</p>
<p>Diatome US is the sole manufacturer of the 3View diamond knives and has developed a proprietary coating for the surfaces of these knives for use in high vacuum environments. Diatome US Joint Venture is the only reliable source that will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><br />This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR Part 12 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 2402765, may be submitted to the NIDA SS/SA Branch electronically to the attention of Hunter A. Tjugum, at hunter.tjugum@nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with MANTECH Security &amp; Mission Assurance Corporation, 7799 Leesburg Pike, STE 700S, Falls Church, VA 22043-2436 for Program Management Security Support Services for the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JSFPO). The Government intends to procure the above service under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1, to ensure there will not be a break in the services required, while a competitive Seaport-e Task Order is being put in place. The period of performance on this procurement will be six months from date of award, with two (2) three-month option periods. <br />The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) (F-35) program is a joint DoD ACAT 1D major acquisition program that includes the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps. JSF also includes eight foreign partner countries formally identified as Cooperative Partner Participants (CPP) along with two other countries called Security Cooperative Participants (SCP). Because of the international nature of the program, combined with the highly sensitive technologies being designed into the total air system, consolidated security support to ensure proper technology protection and dissemination is paramount in the execution of the JSF program. MANTECH Security &amp; Mission Assurance Corporation is currently supplying the support services for this requirement. It is in the Government's best interest to issue a new contract to MANTECH for a continuation of services. This will insure there will not be a break in the services required, which would be detrimental to the JSF Program. The impact of failing to award this continued support for the JSF program is both operational and financial. Protection of the critical technologies that distinguish the combat effectiveness of the JSF from legacy programs is essential to the security of the program and essential that the current support be maintained to continue to protect those technologies throughout the entire program life cycle, including deployment and sustainment. Any interruption to these services would cause the entire program to cease operations. Furthermore, there is a financial impact to disrupting the JSFPO Operations because a restart after a stoppage will lead to duplication of costs that will not be recovered. <br />This contract is being processed solely for the purpose to insure continuity of services to avoid interruption of program support. There is a competitive SEAPORT-e package in process for the contractor support service requirements. This sole source action is a temporary bridge for the continuation of services until the SEAPORT-e Task Order is in place. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br />Responses must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice. Any responses should reference N68335-12-R-0055. The Point of Contact is: Ms. Rachel Bogner, email rachel.bogner@navy.mil.<br />

<SUBJECT>Safety Assessment of Software Tools Used in Nuclear Power Plants
<SOLNBR>NRC-HQ-12-R-04-0043
<ARCHDATE>03122012
<CONTACT>Jennifer A. Defino, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 301-492-3637, Fax 301-492-3437, Email Jennifer.DeFino@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a solicitation for a research project intended to develop information useful to the NRC in evaluating proposed applications involving software tool use in design, code generation, design verification and validation, automated testing, and operation in existing and future nuclear power plants, including advanced nuclear power plants, licensed for operation in the United States. NRC seeks to obtain a consolidated reference document that describes existing regulatory guidance, standards, practices and experience concerning review and/or approval of the use of software tools in engineering systems in nuclear and in other industries, in the United States and in other countries. This project shall review and compare existing standards and regulatory guidance, such as (but not limited to):<br />&bull; IEEE std 7-4.3.2; <br />&bull; IEC 60880; <br />&bull; JEAC4609 Application Guidelines for Programmatic Digital Computer Systems in Safety-Protection Systems of Nuclear Power Plants; <br />&bull; NASA-STD-2201-93; <br />&bull; DO-178B; <br />&bull; NRC regulatory 1.152;<br />&bull; Standard Review Plan Appendix 7.1-D; <br />&bull; Branch Technical Position 7-14; <br />&bull; Interim Staff Guidance (ISG-06);<br />&bull; FAA order 8110.49; <br />&bull; NASA-GB-A201 Software Assurance Guidebook; and references therein. <br />This review and comparison shall summarize all the criteria of these standards and how organizations use the standards in their review/approval processes. It shall address if modifications, if any, are needed to make the software tool review and approval process adequate, clear and easy to follow.
<p><br />Existing regulatory guidance was developed in somewhat independent environments. For example, NRC endorses IEEE 7-4.3.2 while the European common position primarily follows IEC 60880, the NASA guidance documents support NASA standards, and the FAA order supplements RTCA/DO-178B. These standards may overlap each other or some might have overlooked aspects others have considered. This project shall establish a collective view of standards including all the requirements covered and a collective view of regulatory guidance that include all the processes and criteria covered by the guidance. Differences may exist in review and approval software tools used in design, code generation, design V&amp;V, and operation in engineering systems between NRC and regulatory organizations in other countries and in other industries. This project shall analyze how FAA, NASA, European nuclear regulatory organizations, and other organizations and industries review and approve software tools used in engineering system design, code generation, design verification and validation, testing, and operation, and examine how their processes are supported by the industry standards. Based on this research and analysis, NRC may consider endorsing or adopting some of the processes and criteria used by other organizations in software tool review and approval processes, thereby improving existing NRC guidance on review and approval of software tool use.</p>
<p>The final research document shall also present recommendations concerning the review and approval process of software tools used in design, code generation, design verification and validation, automated testing, and operation in domestic nuclear power plants. These recommendations shall include discussion of any limitations or other conditions that should be applied to the use of software tools, and discussion of any special provisions related to the use of software tools. They shall also include recommendations as to the need for and content of procedures and acceptance criteria to be used in the evaluation of proposed designs and systems that use software tools. It shall address both provisions that are built into proposed plant equipment, and provisions that might be added to the equipment after the equipment has been constructed and, possibly, put into service.</p>
<p>In addition, NRC seeks advice as to how existing regulations and guidance should be modified for the licensing of equipment and practices in existing or new domestic nuclear power plants that use software tools in design, code generation, design verification and validation, automated testing, and operation. The final output of this research may be regulatory guidance. It shall have specific and detailed information on review procedures and acceptance criteria for the evaluation of proposed equipment and processes involving the use of software tools in their life cycle.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the project is to develop improved regulatory guidance that endorses the best appropriate industry standards, identifies software tool usage criteria that provide an acceptable way to meet NRC regulatory requirements and provides a clear document for NRC staff to use in the review and approval of software tools.</p>
<p>NRC will use the information and recommendations produced by this research as a reference to develop or modify related regulatory guidance and future review procedures for the proposed equipment and processes involving the use of software tools.</p>
<p>This will be a competitive acquisition for the award of a cost reimbursement type contract. <strong>This procurement is set-aside 100% for Small Business concerns</strong>.

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:<br><br>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager Close Combined Arms Tactical Trainers, Assistant Project Manager for Medical Simulation has a requirement to procure 272 wearable Trauma Bleeding Simulation Systems (TBSS), New Equipment Training (NET); and a warranty period of one year.  Based on the Government's requirement, the TBSS will replicate traumatic injuries and the profuse bleeding that they produce when encountered in a combat environment.  The system must pair with human actors as the vocal reaction to the injury significantly enhances the training realism and is vital to the Army's training objectives.  Finally, the system must also be able to be remotely controlled and be able to demonstrate arterial bleeding.  <br><br>ACQUISITION APPROACH:<br> <br>The Government intends to award a sole-source Firm Fixed-Price contract to Skedco, 10505 SW Manhasset Drive, Tualatin, OR 97062.  This contract will be issued no later than 15 August 2011 on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br><br>SUPPLY:<br><br>Based upon current market research, Skedco is the only company that makes a wearable, bleeding simulation system capable of meeting all of the Government's requirements.  Skedco's Field Expedient Bleeding Simulation System HydraSim  (FEBSS ) recreates active bleeding on human actors while doubling as a common hydration pack.  The HydraSim can be worn on the outside of the uniform while the simulated drink tube is routed underneath the uniform. The entire system is self contained and allows for independent wireless control of two venous and two arterial bleeds.  It is also designed to be used in conjunction with virtually any type of training mannequin (e.g., Rescue Randy or Crash Kelly).  The FEBSS  allows human trauma victims to incorporate training of different stressors that Soldiers are exposed to on the battlefield.<br><br>NOTICE:  <br><br>This notice is being provided to verify that no other sources can meet this requirement.  Contractors desiring to be considered for this opportunity are requested to respond by the closing date above to the contract specialist listed below.  Provide capabilities statements of your experience with manufacturing wearable TBSS that meets the following criteria: 1) replicate traumatic injuries, such as arterial bleeding and the profuse bleeding encountered in a combat environment; 2) able to pair with human actors; and 3) must also be able to be remotely controlled.  Capability statements shall not exceed three (3) pages.<br> <br>DISCLAIMER:  <br><br>This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.  No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notice.  The Government will use the information received to determine whether other sources are available and capable to satisfy this immediate requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this effort based on any responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government, in accordance with FAR Part 6.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for innovative environmental technology demonstrations that address DoD requirements as candidates for funding.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ESTCP's intent to competitively fund demonstration projects as described in the Program Announcement on the ESTCP web site.  <br><br>The Program Announcement which includes specific topics and complete submittal instructions is found at;<br><br>www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/ESTCP-Solicitations <br><br>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  Awards will take the form of contracts.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan. <br><br>To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the Instructions on the web site, no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, March 15, 2012.  No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted. <br> <br>Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process.  The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit technology demonstrations for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal.  Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by ESTCP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether ESTCP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal.  Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, ESTCP will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal.<br><br>Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award.  There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made for a demonstration.  Multiple awards may be made to address a particular topic area.  It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $10.0 million will result depending on availability of funds.  <br><br>Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions' participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value.  If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees. Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA) Small Business Office web site at http://www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.<br><br>The point of contact for procedural questions in the ESTCP Office is Ms. Jina Banks-Saunders, 703-696-2127.

2	GENERAL INFORMATION 
2.1.1	Project Title:
Workers' Compensation Program Legacy Case Management Improvements
2.1.2	Purpose:  
The contractor, applying its administrative and clinical case management expertise and resources under Department Of Labor  Office of Workers' Compensation Program (DOL OWCP) requirements and the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) will reduce the number of existing cases on Periodic Roles (PR cases) through prioritized case management for VHA. The contractor will:
(1)	Identify missing or deficient administrative and clinical documents required by OWCP in the PR case file
(2)	Request case files updates or missing documents through communication with medical providers and DOL OWCP as allowed by OWCP rules
(3)	Provide an updated case management file for VHA for review
(4)	Review the updated file and report on medical documentation related to the reported work injury including medical diagnosis, treatment plan, prognosis and work capacity, and evaluate this information based on the injury report and recognized medical disability guides
(5)	Inform VHA and provide DOL with request for second opinion based on the medical file review
(6)	Identify claimants with work capacity or who should otherwise be removed from the PR Periodic Role for VHA action
(7)	Reduce DOL administrative lag time in adjudication of claims through scheduled communication and follow-up
2.1.3	Background:  
Many VHA facilities experience high chargeback costs.  A review of VHA's PR cases indicates that the Administration needs to improve on WCP case management practices. Case management issues include the availability of skilled WCP case management staff and deficient case management technology. WCP Specialists at many locations have collateral HR duties, large workloads and may not have the training, experience, knowledge or resources to effectively handle case management tasks: many facilities lack clinical case management support.  Moreover, VHA does not have centralized case management technology or processes to collect, store, report or track the case information necessary to effectively manage case activities and processes. While these issues are being improved, case management and closure of PR legacy cases will be sourced to expert WC case management contractors. VHA's review of legacy case files identified issues with DOL claims management. DOL case files were often deficient and sometimes missing required medical reports (diagnosis, treatment plan or work capacity that is inaccurate, inappropriate or nor updated with required timeframes. Due to identified VHA deficiencies, these DOL case files issues are often not attended to by VHA.  This contract effort will update PR case files with appropriate documentation; request follow-up activities from the DOL; obtain timely response actions from DOL; and, adjudicate the PR status as the case file warrants.
2.1.4	Period of Performance:  
The ordering period will be up to five years consisting of one base year with four, one-year option periods.
2.1.5	Type of Contract:  
The government anticipates a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Requirements Contract.  The firm fixed prices shall be priced on a per case basis.  All actual purchase requirements for this activity will be satisfied by placing orders with the awardee.  Only one contract is anticipated to be awarded in response to this solicitation.  
The each order shall be no fewer than 50 cases.  The maximum limit of the contractor's obligation to perform these services is realistically estimated at 2,500 cases.  This estimate is not a representation to an offeror or contractor that the estimated quantity will be required or ordered, or that the conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.
2.1.6	Place of Performance:  
The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, technology, supervision, other items, and non-personnel services necessary to perform Workers' Compensation Case Management file review and follow-up as defined in this Statement of Work at the Contractor's place of business. The Contractor shall support this effort for the Department of Veterans Affairs at approved contractor facilities and as otherwise directed by the COR and mutually agreed to by the Contractor in accordance with contract requirements.  The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.

"	Provide semi-annual Plan reviews (one meeting by telephone and 1 meeting face to face) with advance written report (PowerPoint presentation) to the COR reporting progress to date, identifying deliverable completions, successful (examples) and lagging efforts and any recommendations.
"	Case file information:  Due at the Kickoff/Briefing meeting, the Contractor will provide the COR with a specific list of documents/items needed (a data collection tool/WCP case file data request checklist) for VHA to provide case file information. The contractor must provide contact information for VHA to securely forward PPI information (email, phone, street address, POC).
"	Provide a Project startup Kickoff/Briefing to the VHACO Team discussing implementation of IT security and privacy requirements & identifying POCs. (telephonic meeting)
"	Provide semi-annual Plan reviews.  An advance written report and PowerPoint presentation need to be submitted to the COR one week prior to the conference call, reporting progress to date and identifying deliverable completions, successful and lagging efforts and any recommendations. (One meeting at VHA, the other telephonic).
"	Provide secure web based read access to VHA case files for twenty five (25) VHA users.  The contractor's users will provide web-based training/information on how to navigate the contractor's CMS.  Access will be provided when the contractor begins to populate the CMS. VHA Users will have reader access, with the ability to observe case file information and print documents.
"	Electronic Data File: Once per year, VHA may request that case management data be exported to a data file for VHA use. It is not known at this time what DBMS would be employed by VHA.  The vendor should have Database Conversion / Migration Tools that would allow the data file to be read by the common DBMS in use today. VHA would note the file structured desired in the annual and final data request.  Within 30 days after contract completion a finalized electronic data file must be submitted by the vendor.
"	Monthly Case Management Report 'MCM Task 2 Report' (It's expected that the CMS (when populated) should be able to deliver these monthly reports).  The MCM Task 2 Report is one of the two key routine project progress documents and includes the performance measure 'Initial Case Review Complete'. Within 5 calendar days of the end of a month, the MCM Task 2 Report will be issued electronically to the WCP National Program manager, COR, CO and the VISN WCP POC (8 in number). The WCP National Manager has 10 calendar days to review and approve any proposed Task 3 activities.  The MCM Report will include:
o	Number of VHA case files received (PR & PN) from VHA (monthly and running totals)
o	Number of VHA case files completing DOL case look-up (AQS and ACS) (monthly and running totals from Task 2)
o	Number of case files populated in the CMS (monthly and running totals) with deficiency report
o	Monthly communications with DOL or Office Visits completed (identifying cases and information requested, obtained and case status)
o	Number of requests for medical documentation sent to and received from medical providers (status of requests)
o	Number of requests for medical record updates sent to DOL/ number of DOL responses received (status for requests)
o	Status Report including number case reviews complete and recommendations (cases ready) for Task 3 action (clinical review or DOL action request) and other information/issues regarding progress.
"	The Case Management Project Table below provides 5-phases of the Project. The Contractor will complete the administrative case file review (1 through 2 below); move cases to follow-up actions (3 through 4 below); and, follow the phase 5  through VHA/DOL until the case closed.  The contractor will move assigned PR Cases to a phase 5 milestone (see Table below) for VHA or DOL response.
"	Milestone measures occur when the contractor provides VHA with sufficient information to make a job-offer or the contractor/VHA submits an adjudication request for DOL action. Identify DOL/OWCP case file deficiencies and request updates from OWCP on missing and deficient information; provide appropriate communications on essential claim-related information to VHA and DOL.
Case Management Project Phases
1.	Collect case information and documents to populate in a case management electronic file system database that can be viewed by VHA WCP specialists.
2.	Identify the current medical status of claimants as appropriate by reviewing information available from VHA, DOL and medical providers, communicating with DOL and medical providers and requesting medical updates as needed for a complete file review.
3.	Following DOL/OWCP procedures through clinical record review to:
1)	Identify workers capable of return to work
o	Requesting second opinions from DOL as justified (notify VHA first)
o	Identifying cases that have reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) that would place work restrictions in perform the job held when injured, likely requiring a job modification for employment.  
o	The contractor will report to VHA on claimants with work capacity for return to the job held when injured. (Report to VHA for job offers).
o	Providing information to VHA to support job offers (actual job offer will be from VHA).
2)	Identify and report to VHA cases where termination of benefits is appropriate: the worker should not qualify for DOL benefits based on administrative or clinical case review - for example:
o	The claimant is deceased
o	The claimant is capable of working or is working
o	The claimant's injury is not the reason for reduced work capacity to perform the job
o	The claimant is retired or should be retired
o	Other reason for termination of benefits
4.	Continue case support, follow-up with VHA to generate a job offers and other action requests and case follow-up actions on requests to DOL for actions: 
o	Notification to VHA that job offers or other DOL action items requests from VHA to DOL are outstanding
5.	Follow-up on submitted case action requests with DOL (job offers, SECOPs and other adjudication issues) until closed, escalating action requests as needed.

The Contractor's effort will be staffed by professionals having expert knowledge and experience working with the OWCP on administrative and clinical case management. The Contractor's case management staff and technology will provide best practices in prioritized case management to identify cases with missing/or inadequate OWCP required information. The Contractor will ensure that case information requests and updates are communicated to the appropriate DOL staff and provide routine (at least monthly) follow up on requests to minimize DOL administrative lag time in reviewing requests and documentation provided. 
The participating VHA facilities have approximately 1500 PR cases (PR: entitled to payment on the OWCP Periodic Roll) to review for actions/deliverables. Approximately 250 new PR cases are added each year. The contractor's review will focus upon cases with the highest value return to VHA first, which includes high cost cases and those cases most easily re-classified from PR status. Again, this SOW defines resolving as completing the case file review and completing follow-up actions, including requesting DOL action (second opinion request, termination of benefits request, status re-classification, job offer, etc.) and identifying to VHA cases having work capacity for job offers.  VHA understands that DOL actions or VHA job offers may not occur even with diligent contractor efforts within a contract year, so we have defined resolve on circumstance that the contractor should be able to accomplish.  Nevertheless, the contractor will continue to monitor resolved cases with VHA and DOL to move cases along.  The contractor should have standard processes for follow-up with OWCP regarding case management actions within the CMS.
The participating VHA facilities have more than 800 PN case files.  The contractor will provide VHA with criteria for red flag inspection of these files and identify information needed from VHA to review red flag cases.  The contractor will then be provided 25 PN red flagged files/year for further review. The 25 PN files will be populated in the contractor's CMS and updated with AQS and ACS information.  The contractor will request/obtain additional documentation from DOL as needed to complete the record and medical providers to update the record. The contractor will recommend DOL and VHA follow-up actions on these cases when the file is administratively complete.  Action on the 25 PN cases will determined by the VHA National WCP Manager and depend on the VHA's available budget.
All cases provided to the contractor by VHA will identify the current cost of each case.  Cases provided to the contractor will be populated in the contractor's case management System 'CMS' (note that VHA does not have a CMS and information may be hard copy).  At the closure of this contract or when requested by VHA, the contractor will provide information entered into their CMS in electronic format suitable for reading by common database applications (The CMS must have data output utilities providing multiple electronic output options including text file, Excel file and common database file formats).
A number of tasks are identified in this SOW.  The work flow should be an iterative process and it is not intended that the contractor complete Task 2 for all cases prior to moving on to Task 3.  The contractor should move individual cases through the Task/Delivery process as quickly as possible to reach the 'resolved' status.
4	ASSOCIATED TASKS
4.1	TASK 1: Project Plan and Data Management

1.	Complete all VA, VAOIT, HR and DOL data security, privacy and contract requirements for privacy and security including background investigations (BI).
2.	Complete all DOL security requirements for contractor staff access to WCP data including VA required training to access, transmit and store protected information under HIPPA and Federal privacy rules.  The VA will request DOL approval for contractor staff access to DOL WCP information of VHA employees. The contractor will notify the VHA when the Contractor has completed all security requirements and is able to receive VHA employee privacy protected information (PPI).  VHA will then provide case information to contractor within 2 weeks of receipt of contractor's ability to securely accept PPI. The Contractor should notify the COR when case information delivery is not on schedule. 

4.2	TASK 2: Case File Review & Update Activities
The following are Task 2 Efforts.  The contractor will follow DOL/OWCP requirements in requesting information.  Task 2 efforts will result in a complete case file including all DOL/OWCP forms and documentation for PR classification.
(1)	DOL case look-up including AQS and ACS on select cases
(2)	Assigned cases populated in the CMS with all documentation input
(3)	Case File Monthly Status Report identifying deficiencies/issues
(4)	Contractor prioritizes cases for review with DOL 
(5)	Travel to DOL Offices to update files, communication with DOL representatives
(6)	DOL medical report updates requests
(7)	Medical documentation requests (written) sent to medical providers (obtain HIPPA release from VHA)
(8)	Monthly recommendations for Task 3 action (clinical review)

4.3	TASK 3: Case Follow-up Actions
Task 3 implements approved activities from Task 2 and new Task 3 activities to resolve medical documentation issues or request DOL case action beyond a medical record update.  As appropriate under FECA and OWCP requirements, the Contractor will act on behalf of VHA in communications with DOL and treatment providers.  As approved activities by the National WCP Manager, the Contractor on behalf of VHA may engage in the following (note that these activities are recommended in the MCM Task 2 Report): Communications with:
"	Injured worker
"	Additional communication with treating physician and treatment providers
"	DOL OWCP (case action requests and follow-up)
"	VHA WCP Specialist

Case Medical Review and Update Tasks:

8	DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AGREEMENT LANGUAGE
The awardee will be required to sign an agreement that will closely mirror the following:
Contract No. xxxxxxxxx; Order No. xxxxxxxxxxxx, VENDOR Agreement between The Department of Veterans Affairs (also referenced as 'DVA') and VENDOR Under FECA and USDOL OWCP requirements.
As agreed to herein by signature, The DVA and VENDOR incorporate the following language as part of referenced Contract No. xxxxxxxxxxxx.
Access to information in the system of records maintained by the U.S. Department of Labor under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, entitled DOL/GOVT-1, "Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Federal Employees' Compensation Act File," is provided pursuant to a routine use promulgated by the Department of Labor and published in the system notice in the Federal Register.  VENDOR recognizes and acknowledges that any duplicate copies of these records that are maintained by the DVA and provided to VENDOR belong to DOL, and do not constitute records of the DVA, and will abide by DOL's rules governing access and disclosure of these records.  (See 20 C.F.R.  10.10-10.13.)  
The DVA (Veterans Health Administration (VHA)) and VENDOR also agree that the following language from Chapter 9 of the Employing Agency Handbook, "Injury Compensation for Federal Employees," paragraph 9-2 "Inspection and Protection of Records," governs use of information from OWCP case files by VENDOR in the course of performing its contractual responsibilities to the DVA
Claims staffs are instructed to provide agency personnel with copies of all significant correspondence to employees, even when the employees are no longer on the agency's rolls.  Under the routine use provisions of the regulations governing release of information under the Privacy Act, agencies are entitled to obtain copies of other materials in their employees' compensation files as well.
The use of these copies must, however, be consistent with the reason the information was collected.  In practice, this means that the use must be connected in some way with the compensation claim.  Agencies may not use copies of information from claim files in connection with EEO complaints, disciplinary actions, or other administrative actions without the employee's consent.  Any questions concerning use or release of records should be directed to the OWCP district office servicing the case.
To the extent that the VENDOR believes that a court order requires disclosure of information from a FECA record maintained by DOL under DOL/GOVT-1, VENDOR and the DVA will not disclose any such information from a FECA record without clearing such anticipated disclosure with DOL.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The NIEHS seeks capability statements from qualified small businesses to conduct or provide support for said clinical studies above. <span>&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The ultimate design and oversight of implementation of these studies will be the responsibility of the NIEHS Task Leader initiating the study, but advice may be sought from the NIEHS Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Technical Representative (COTR), Contractor or a contracted panel of experts.<span>&nbsp; </span>The extent of the Contractor's involvement with any given study shall vary depending on the support available in-house or through collaborators.<span>&nbsp; </span>At times, the Contractor shall carry out only selected study components. <span>&nbsp;</span>For example, for a given study the Contractor might conduct only the surveillance and recruitment phase, develop and administer study questionnaires, administer treatment or only collect biospecimens and environmental samples.<span>&nbsp; </span>At other times, the Contractor might conduct the entire study with oversight from the NIEHS Task Leader. </span></p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible small business firms capable of performing Design/Bid/Build Construction Services for RM 09-2102 and RM09-2103, Buildings 688 and 689 Q4/BQ Repairs and Alterations, Naval Station Newport, Newport, Rhode Island

The Contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, tools, parts, supplies, and transportation, to perform all of the services described in the plans and specifications.  

The proposed construction will repair and renovate Buildings 688 and 689 Coddington Point at Naval Station Newport.
  The facilities were constructed in the early to mid 1970s and are primarily used to house unaccompanied military personnel.  Each building consists of 3 levels with a flat roof. The housing facilities are based on a quad concept of 4 individual rooms and a common lounge area.  Each room has a small private bathroom.   Bldg 688 currently consists of 15 quad units and Bldg 689 consists of 27 quad units.  A portion of Bldg 689 is supported on concrete columns that extend below the first level due to the grade differential.  There is a common courtyard space separating the two structures.

The elevated levels of both buildings are accessed by external, stand-alone stair towers.  Bldg 688 is serviced by two stair towers and Bldg 689 is serviced by three stair towers.
  Access to each housing quad unit is by open balconies with metal handrails.  The mechanical rooms and associated utility connections are located on the first level of Bldg 688 which currently serves as the central plant for both bldgs. There is a common lounge space and laundry area in Bldg 688 which is being renovated under this contract.  Records show that the windows were replaced for both buildings in 1993, and window upgrades are not required for this scope of work.   The buildings structural system consists of light-gage cold-formed metal bearing walls supporting open web steel floor joists with concrete floor deck.  The roof system also consist of open web steel roof joists with concrete decking, built-up roofing, with gravel ballast.

The main scope of work includes updating the mechanical and electrical systems, adding fire suppression system, and some architectural upgrades to the building exterior and living quarters.
  The description outlined herein is not inclusive of all work that is scheduled to be performed, but a general outline of the major objectives.

LIFE SAFETY:    

Life Safety work includes the installation of a sprinkler system and a modern fire alarm/mass-notification system.

MECHANICAL:  

Mechanical work includes the replacement of plumbing systems and bathroom components in the common lounge space and laundry room; the installation of PTHP mechanical units in each room and common space for climate control; and other similar related work.  The two buildings will no longer use the Central Plant in Bldg 688 for heating. A mechanical ventilation system will consist of a Dedicated Outside Air Unit (DOAU), supplying 100% outside air to all occupied rooms.
  The domestic hot water is heated by the base central utility steam distribution system in the winter and an oil-fired boiler in the summer located in the mechanical room of Bldg 688.  The oil-fired boiler and steam domestic hot water system will be replaced in-kind.   Work will need to be phased to maintain hot and cold domestic water to each of the buildings during the construction.  The base has a current underground steam utility replacement project ongoing that will need to tie into the new domestic hot water steam system in Bldg 688. Shower heads throughout the buildings will be replaced with low flow type.  

ELECTRICAL:

Electrical work includes demolition work and installation of new electrical transformers, panels, and circuits, to both modernize and to account for load increases (due to PTHP installation and additional outlets).
  Replacement of electrical distribution system consists of service entrance conductors, switchboard, and panel boards.  The installation of a new primary duct bank from the Bldg 460 switch, thru a manhole to Bldg 689 will be required. New fiber runs for telephone, NMCI, DDC, and future capacity will be pulled from Bldg 690 and terminated in the Bldg 688 electrical room.  Providing new lighting fixtures in common area rooms and walkways, and providing new duplex receptacles in common area rooms and additional receptacles for laundry and dryer rooms.  A lightning protection system will be provided for each building.

ARCHITECTURAL:

Architectural work includes the installation of a new roof system at existing stair towers; safety railings at the access panels; enclosing of the existing stairwells with metal panels and new doors; the re-pointing and pressure washing of exterior brick masonry and concrete retaining walls; gutter cleaning; painting and carpeting in interior spaces;  and other similar related work.
  Provide resilient tile in common lounge floor areas and paint all rooms including door and trim work.  Replace damaged doors as to be indicated on the drawings.  Bldg 688 and 689 will not be made ADA accessible; only the common lounge spaces and laundry areas will be made accessible in Bldg 688.  Additional interior renovations will occur on the first floor common areas and other proposed spaces.

STRUCTURAL:

Structural work will support new metal panel fascia at stairwells and quad entry areas.  New framing will be provided for a new glazed storefront and will be ATFP rated.  Misc structural work is anticipated to support the other renovation and repair work.  

CIVIL:

Civil work includes re-grading and minor landscaping work; the installation of concrete equipment pads; the installation of drain pipe; and the installation of new water service out to the street main.
  A new ramp may be required for accessibility at Bldg 688.  Area of disturbance is less than one acre and will not trigger LID requirements.

DEMOLITION:

Demolition of mechanical room equipment and piping, and other demolition to support the renovations will be required throughout the construction period.  There are existing hazardous materials, in the form of ACM, lead paint, pcb materials which will require abatement as indicated on the construction documents.  A Hazardous Material report has been prepared outlining the extent of these materials.

PHASING REQUIREMENT:

Phasing of construction consist of the majority of work to begin on Bldg 689 interiors first.  Occupants will leave Bldg 689 prior to construction.
  Tentative plans are for the Contractor to move the existing furniture to the local Government provided warehouse for storage and/or disposal using FFE funding.  Work must also immediately begin on Bldg 688 while this dormitory remains occupied.  This will limit construction to exterior work, mechanical room demo, and common space renovations.  Phasing will require careful coordination with occupants and planning with base activities.  Upon completion of Bldg 689 renovations, occupants of Bldg 688 will move to Bldg 689 to allow for interior renovations of 688 to begin.  Existing furniture will again need to be moved to local storage.  A planned modification for the FFE package will include all new furniture and fixtures for the bedrooms, common spaces, and lounges.
   A new office area is also planned for incorporation into both buildings, which will also require installation of new fiber runs for the data ports. The Contractor will be responsible for providing the final FFE design and selection and procuring and installing the furniture, through the BVA process.  FFE funding will be provided separately from the Construction award funds for the renovations and repairs.

BID OPTIONS: 

Bid options are anticipated and will include the following:

1. An option to provide a DDC System

2. An option to replace bathroom lavatories.

3. An option to provide new metal panel protective screens to be added at the faade at the quad entry doors.

4. An option to renovate Common Areas, Bldg 688.

The listed options represent only a partial list.
  As requirements for the project firm up the list of options may increase. 

The magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

<DESC>FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION ACTION: The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has a requirement to provide support for Ambient Air Monitoring and Quality Assurance Support.  The U.S. EPA?s ambient air monitoring and quality assurance program focuses on issues concerning implementation and operation of national, state/local, and tribal air monitoring networks.  In addition, the program addresses the quality of the measurement data of the criteria air pollutants [carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3) nitrogen dioxide (NO2), lead (Pb), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and various sizes of particulate matter (PM10, PM10-2.5, PM2.5)], chemical speciation of particulate matter, air toxic compounds, and ozone precursors required to be measured by the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) program.  A principal objective of EPA?s monitoring and quality assurance role is to ensure that the qual ity of the data collected and reported by state/local/tribal agencies, federal agencies, and other parties, can be quantified and can be used to support programs such as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the federal reference and equivalency program, and the nation?s air quality management programs.  Solid technical support is critical to the US EPA?s ability to support air quality management policies and programs, as this support will directly impact federal, state, and local air quality monitoring activities.  This requirement shall provide support for the ambient air monitoring and quality assurance programs including, but not limited to, the associated federal regulations and policies, outreach activities, technical guidance, field activities, special studies, program and quality system development, statistical support, desktop publishing support, website design and operation and data retrievals.  The resultant contract shall provide the necessary labor , material, facilities, and expertise required for the performance of tasks specified in the Statement of Work (See Draft Statement of Work). Specific details of the requirement will be outlined in the Statement of Work.

<DESC>Abbreviation and terminology<br />&bull; Social Security Administration (SSA)<br />&bull; Division of System Storage Management (DSSM)<br />&bull; Mainframe Data Assurance Branch (MDAB)<br />&bull; Oracle Virtual Storage Manager (VSM)<br />&bull; Oracle Virtual Library Extension (VLE)<br />&bull; Disk Library Manager (DLm)<br /><br />Background<br />SSA's Mainframe Data Assurance Branch (MDAB) is responsible for ensuring accessibility, recovery, and archival of 19+ petabytes of tape storage containing data about program beneficiaries, wage-earners, and recipients of other services. Additional storage requirements are needed to maintain systems and software comprising the mainframe infrastructure necessary to collect and maintain client data captured within leagacy systems and master data base files. DSSM's purpose is to assure the integrity, security, and efficient utilization of all enterprise-wide storage media resources for SSA.
<p>SSA's current tape storage infrastructure consists of 28 SL-8500 tape libraries, 750 T10000-B tape drives, 200 9840C and D tape drives, 2 VSM-4 Virtual Storage Managers, 4 VSM-5 Virtual Storage Managers, 4 Virtual Library Extensions, 14 Oracle Key Managers/Key Management Appliance encryption appliances, and 4 DLm Virtual Storage devices. SSA also uses a mixture of L700 and L500 tape libraries with a mix of LTO-4 and T10000-B tape drives to service our open systems environment. (Please note: the environment is fluid, so the number of these devices vary with time). SSA's enterpise software environment consists of CA-1 tape management software, and IBM z/OS v 1.12 operating system using JES3 job entry subsystem.</p>
<p>Principle areas of performance will be Baltimore, MD and Durham, NC.</p>
<p>Statement of need<br />SSA is seeking vendors who can provide storage and tape management analytics software and reporting tools to enhance the virtual tape environment with an emphasis on strategic management and operational capabilities for the storage infrastructure. Additional SRM tools are needed to maintain virtual tape appliance systems and software comprising the mainframe tape virtual infrastructure. These tools must provide information about dasd, real tape, virtual tape systems, and other storage media, as well as trending/forecasting, threshold exception alerts, automated report/alert distribution, configuration and diagnostic data collection, and capacity, utilization, and performance statistics. The required solution will facilitate the Agency's ability to monitor, predict, and automate storage management operations, and facilitate efficiency of tape and disk storage processing for the production environment.</p>
<p>Requirements<br />DSSM is actively pursuing strategies intended to modernize storage infrastructure and reduce storage costs by exploiting evolving storage technologies, data replication techniques, reducing use of real tape solutions, and reducing energy consumption, cooling requirements, and aggregate physical displacement of tape storage ecosystem(s). The scope of DSSM's strategic objectives is to maintain the infrastructure environment for the following: (1) enterprise class main-line DASD subsystems; (2) enterprise class tape subsystems; (3) enterprise class near-line DASD subsystems; (4) data replication infrastructure; and (4) storage resource management (SRM) and storage performance management (SPM) software and tools. <br /><br />Respondents should provide solutions supporting the SSA enterprise storage facilities with SRM and SPM capabilities to efficiently manage the storage environment, including the following:<br /><br />1) Auditing facilities for tape management systems, tape robotics, tape catalogs, DASD, virtual tape systems, and data replication functions<br />2) Historical data capture to be used for trending and forecasting<br />3) Analysis of multi-volume datasets<br />4) Automation capabilities for job scheduling, report distribution and exception alert notification<br />5) Automation of corrective actions facilitating operational responsiveness<br />6) Monitoring and reporting capabilities for diagnostics and troubleshooting of the storage management environment<br />7) Monitoring and reporting capabilities for enterprise storage (real, virtual tape, and disk) capacity and utilization of resources<br /><br />Requested Information<br />Responses to this Request for Information should provide a comprehensive overview describing the proposed Storage Analytics and Reporting tools solution to address SSA's Requirements (see above) and additional functionalities for improving management, operational efficiency, and strategic objectives of the DSSM storage management teams, including but not limited to the following:<br /><br />1) Enhanced operational efficiencies using Storage Analystics and Reporting tools <br />2) Provide seamless integration with existing infrastructure components<br />3) Interoperability with existing tape infrastructure components, both hardware and software<br />4) Provide robust enterprise storage planning/forecasting capabilities<br />5) Improve responsiveness and efficacy of event management and troubleshooting capabilities<br />6) Improve staff productivity through automation and ease-of-use functionality<br /><br /><br />Vendor Responses<br />Vendors that believe they can offer a technically compliant product are invited to submit information concerning their product's capabilities. Detailed responses to each of the above requirements (with substantiating documentation) are required. The vendor response must provide detailed accounts of how each of the requirements is met. Simple marketing information or incomplete responses will not be considered. Reference to vendor web sites is not considered a valid response. <br />Respondents should indicate whether their software is available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules or any other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC). You may submit product cost and/or pricing data, inclusive of annual maintenance, with your response, however it is not required. Respondents should refer to SSA-RFI-12-0125. Electronic responses only must be submitted by 3:00 PM, ET, January 25, 2012. Faxed information will not be permitted.

<SUBJECT>Proposers Day Conference for the Mobile Hotspots Program 
<SOLNBR>DARPA-SN-12-23
<RESPDATE>020912
<ARCHDATE>02142012
<CONTACT>BAA Administrator, Email DARPA-BAA-12-23@darpa.mil
<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE 12-23 MOBILE HOTSPOTS PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE
<p>DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Mobile Hotspots program on February 14, 2012 at System Planning Corporation, 3601 Wilson Blvd, 6th floor, Arlington, VA 22203 from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM in support of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) DARPA-BAA-12-23 (expected to be released prior to the Conference). The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the Mobile Hotspots program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities; and, following the Conference, conduct pre-scheduled one-on-one meetings with the Program Manager as described below.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: DARPA anticipates releasing the BAA for Mobile Hotspots with the objective described in this section. The objective of the Mobile Hotspots program is to design, build and test a scalable mobile communications backbone with the capacity and range needed to connect the dismounted warfighter with FOBs, TOCs, remote ISR sources, and fixed communications infrastructure.  The program envisions aerial, mobile and fixed assets-most of which are organic to the unit-that provide a gigabit-per-second tactical backbone network that extends capacity to the lowest echelon warfighters.  The program leverages recent availability of commercial components to build millimeter-wave point-to-point links operating at E-Band frequencies (71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz) to form the high capacity backbone.  However, the program moves beyond commercial capabilities by developing the pointing, acquisition and tracking (PAT) technologies needed to provide high connectivity to the mobile hotspots and by increasing transmit power to provide sufficient ranges within the small size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints required for company-level unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).  The program will also leverage advances in efficient power amplifiers at E-Band frequencies to achieve the equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) needed to meet the range goals with small steerable antennas.  The Mobile Hotspots program will develop and demonstrate the networking functions needed to form and maintain a backhaul network and provide reliable end-to-end data delivery among the hotspots as well as from ISR sources and command centers to the hotspot users.  Functions include the node discovery mechanisms, topology management, QoS-based routing, and reliability mechanisms of the backhaul network.  Each mobile hotspot contains a commercial radio (e.g. WiFi, WiMax) for a cost-effective demonstration of the high capacity backbone and its ability to support multiple users, as well as the exfiltration and dissemination of ISR information.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register no later than close of business (5:00 PM ET) February 9, 2012, by sending an email with full name, organization, address, telephone number, and email address of attendees to:  DARPA-BAA-12-23@darpa.mil. The word "PROPOSERS DAY" must appear in the subject line of the email.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 80 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization.   The Proposers' Day will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.  Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 "Foreign National Visit Request".  Forms will be emailed upon receipt of registration.  The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be returned to: DARPA-BAA-12-23@darpa.mil, no later than close of business February 9, 2012.  The attendance roster will be released to all attendees after the conclusion of the conference. If your name should not appear on the attendance roster you must so state in email to DARPA-BAA-12-23@darpa.mil.</p>
<p>The Proposers' Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Proposer's Day.</p>
<p>Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so.  Presentations may contain 4 slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues).  Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposers' Day Conference should send email to DARPA-BAA-12-23@darpa.mil no later than February 7, 2012.  The words "COMPANY OVERVIEW" must appear in the subject line of the email.</p>
<p>All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager.  The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material for sensitive but unclassified material and approve in advance any presentations.  It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the Proposers' Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance.  An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to the DARPA Program Manager for review by February 7, 2012.  There will be no exceptions to this requirement.</p>
<p>ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS WITH THE PROGRAM MANAGER:  Afternoon one-on-one meetings with the DARPA Program Manager will be held at Science and Technology Assoc., 4100 N. Fairfax Dr., Ste 910, Arlington, VA beginning at 1:00 pm. The one-on-one sessions starting at 1:00 pm with the DARPA Program Manager, Dr. Richard Ridgway, can be scheduled individually by sending an email to DARPA-BAA-12-23@darpa.mil requesting a time for a one-on-one meeting with the PM. The words "ONE-ON-ONE MEETING" must appear in the subject line of the email.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Description</strong></p>
<p>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY - Sophia</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by the Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license, further develop, and commercialize Sophia, a new software tool for providing improved situational awareness of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. INL may also be available to assist in further research and development of Sophia under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***Background: The Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (DOE-OE) has invested in INL cyber security researchers' efforts (over 6 full-time equivalents for two years) to develop Sophia as a tool that will improve situational awareness on a SCADA network. The improved situational awareness will help users secure the SCADA network.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sophia software was developed based on an industry need.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This need was identified during on-site cyber security assessments, discussions with users at various SCADA user group meetings and training sessions, and an understanding of open source tools used in evaluating the cyber security footprint of a SCADA. The philosophy for the tool development was to identify concerns related to SCADA deployment by using the same techniques as cyber attackers and encourage mitigation of those concerns.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 4pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 4pt">***Description: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Sophia is a passive, real time tool for inter-device communication discovery and monitoring of the active elements in a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sophia monitors network traffic from which it extracts the source, destination, and port sets (conversations) between SCADA components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These conversations are stored in real time to establish a list of conversations that are valid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***Advantages: Sophia provides the user with the knowledge to make wise decisions that enhance the security and reliability of their SCADA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Key <span style="mso-no-proof: yes">features of Sophia include:</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">-- Passive, online, real time conversation analysis; no interaction with the SCADA.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">-- SCADA network traffic visualization in a 3-D graphical environment.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">-- Safe to use in a production environment.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">-- Works with new and legacy systems.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">-- Ease of use - can be learned in one to two days.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">-- Detects and alarms on conversations that are not part of normal SCADA operations.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">-- Fingerprint export for offline analysis.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">-- Software hooks allow sharing fingerprint data with third party tools for offline analysis.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">-- Provides full functionality for SCADA installations in the Energy sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10pt">***Potential Applications: The most immediate application of this invention relates to situational awareness of SCADA networks in the Energy sector. However, the technology also has applications relating to network traffic anomaly detection and alarming, vulnerability and red team assessments, test beds for cyber security system analysis and testing, network mapping tools and techniques, and secure network design consultation, although these applications may not be fully developed or fully tested yet.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10pt">***Development Status: Sophia is currently in beta testing, expected to be complete in 2012. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>U.S. organizations are invited to apply to become beta testers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sophia is slated for commercialization for wide scale production distribution by October 2012.</p>
<p>***Intellectual Property: INL has asserted copyright in the Sophia software and filed a U.S. Patent Application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***Commercial Opportunity: INL is seeking industry partners to continue to develop and commercialize this technology. The ideal licensee would have some or all of the following qualifications:</p>
<p>-- Experience in a related business, especially related to security for SCADA systems in the Energy sector.</p>
<p>-- Demonstrated ability to bring new technologies to the market.</p>
<p>-- The resources to make a significant investment in the commercialization of this technology.</p>
<p>-- An interest in performing and funding cooperative research at the INL if necessary.</p>
<p>-- Substantial manufacturing and research operations in the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INL, in accordance with its contract with the Department of Energy, also intends to give preference to qualified small business respondents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies interested in commercializing Sophia should provide a written statement of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than sixty (60) days from the publication date of this Notice. The statement of interest should include the following information:<br />1. Company Name and address<br />2. The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact<br />3. A description of corporate business and technical expertise relevant to commercializing this technology</p>

<DESC>TITLE:  ENGAGEMENT SKILLS TRAINER (EST II) - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) dated January 12, 2012<br><br>Notice Type:  RFI<br><br>Response Date:  15 days after Hands on Demo of EST or NLT 5 March 2012<br><br>Original Set aside: N/A<br><br>Set Aside:  N/A<br><br>Classification Code:  69 - Training Aids and Devices<br><br>NAICS Code: 333- Machinery manufacturing/333319 - Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing <br><br><br>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE ACQUISITION:<br><br>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Management Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (PM CATT), Project Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (PM GCTT) is contemplating a new contract for a technical refresh of fielded Engagement Skills Trainers (EST)/marksmanship trainers and  their weapons to a EST II, procurement of EST II systems and EST II weapons, New Equipment Training, Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) on the EST II systems and weapons , and logistic support.  This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.   This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.   <br><br>PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.   This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".  <br><br>BACKGROUND:<br><br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.   It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC). Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range. Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br><br>1.      Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST and apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.  <br><br>a.       System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br><br>b.      Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br><br>c.       Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br><br>d.      High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br><br>e.       High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br><br>f.       All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br><br>g.      Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br><br>h.      Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.      Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.      Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government  to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.      Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.<br><br>5.      Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS 2) into the system.<br><br><br>HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:<br><br>1.    Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.   This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.   <br><br>PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.   This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".  <br><br>BACKGROUND:<br><br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.   It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC). Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range. Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br><br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br><br>1.      Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST and apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.  <br><br>a.       System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br><br>b.      Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br><br>c.       Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br><br>d.      High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br><br>e.       High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br><br>f.       All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br><br>g.      Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br><br>h.      Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.      Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.      Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government  to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.      Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.<br><br>5.      Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS 2) into the system.<br><br><br>HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:<br><br>1.    Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

<a href="mailto:dshannon@usgs.gov">dshannon@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to award a purchase order to Trimble Navigation Systems for  one (1 EA)  base and two (2 EA) rover receivers and associated cabling, interfaces, controllers, and accessories with GNSS RTK capabilities.  The USGS volcanic hazard programs use topographic surveying equipment to measure and monitor a variety of processes such as volcanic dome growth, stream channel morphology, precision mapping, and remote sensing ground control.  Real-time kinematic global positioning systems (RTK GPS) have provided surveyors with increased efficiency, flexibility and accuracy over traditional optical equipment. The Trimble R7 and R8 GNSS receivers can track all modernized GPS signals, as well as those broadcast by the GLONASS system.  These receivers are capable of tracking signals broadcast by the soon-to-be-launched GALILEO satellite navigation system as well as upcoming GPS signals (L2C and L5).  The Trimble R7/R8 RTK system is specifically designed for topographic surveying in remote, high-relief terrain.  High reliability, durability, compact design, and low-power consumption make these receivers ideal for USGS deployments.  The Trimble R7 allows the base to achieve geodetic quality.  GNSS receivers from other vendors do not achieve the RTK system technical requirements.  In addition, our field engineers, surveyors, and data processors are familiar with configuring and operating the R7/R8 receivers because the interface is similar to the other Trimble products used (5700 and GeoXH GPS receivers and geodetic antennas, Nomad and Recon handheld computers, field and office software, etc.).   In addition, a Trimble RTK system is compatible with the large cache of Trimble equipment at our office as well as numerous USGS Surface water offices we collaborate with.  Trimble data radios can be programmed to the frequencies required by our current radio frequency authorizations. Purchasing a Trimble R7/R8 RTK system over other manufacturers ensures the system meets our technical requirements, is the most compatible with equipment we currently deploy, and has the least cost associated with interfaces and interoperability considerations, training and schedule impacts.  There would be additional cost and schedule impacts to the program if other equipment was procured with respect to training, interfaces, cabling, interoperability, and similar issues.  In addition, different radios may require new frequency authorizations adding further delays.   In summary, awarding this sole source to Trimble would allow us to purchase equipment that meets our technical requirements, is compatible with what we already deploy and support, and minimizes costs associated with interfaces, training and schedule impacts.  Full listing of specifications/salient characteristics is attached.
Delivery date:  30 days ARO.  Place of Delivery:  USGS Volcano Science Center, Vancouver, WA 98683.  No solicitation documents will be issued.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency.  NAICS: 334511.  Anticipated award date:  On or about Jan 19, 2012.  Point of Contact:  D. Shannon, Contracts Specialist, (916) 278-9342, dshannonn@usgs.gov

o	From 224th Street extend a main line to the south approximately 1350 linear feet to the point of connection of the cemetery property.

o	The point of connection shall be an 8 flange at the property line located 7.5 east of the northwest property corner.

o	Provide a 6 meter and vault outside of the cemetery property with transitions to 8 minimum service line on the upstream and downstream side of the meter vault.

o	Provide and maintain a gravel road at a minimum between SE 224th Street and the northwest corner of the cemetery property.

o	Provide a common drain access for the CRWDS meter vault and the cemetery owned PRV vault and two DCVA vaults, location to be determined.

o	The water main extension shall be designed to provide the VA with 800 gpm (estimated peak irrigation demand at full cemetery build-out) with 65 PSI minimum residual pressure at the point of connection assuming Peak Day System Demands.

o	Perform all work to permit the above work from the authorities having jurisdiction as well as secure all easements required to install the water main and service lines.  Temporary construction easements shall include provisions for the VAs contractors to install VA water improvements on the VA property just south of the point of connection.

o	Provide ongoing operation and maintenance of VA owned equipment near the point of connection including 8 PRV, 8 DCVA, and 4 DCVA.  Future work will be under a separate agreement.

	Remove the existing 3 water meter at the existing water service location on 224th Street.

	Coordinate ownership transfer of existing hydrant with Covington Water District.

CEDAR RIVER WATER AND SEWER DISTRICT is to obtain all permits and associated property/easement rights to install Water Service.  The applicable NAICS code is 221310.  The Government intends to issue a single award as a sole source and anticipates awarding of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to CEDAR RIVER WATER AND SEWER DISTRICT.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source
Item:  Ergotron Carts
Vendor:  Versitec 
Statutory Authority:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements per FAR 6.302-1

Service Required:  Service includes next business day on site service, preventive maintenance visit annually and one complete battery replacement and removal and disposal of bad batteries.  The PM will include a complete report of each carts condition and repairs will be made including parts up to 100.00 for each cart inspected.  All parts including power supply are covered once the PMs are finished and carts are brought up to spec. 

Background:  Versitec is the only authorized and certified service provider by Ergotron, the manufacturer of the mobile computing carts.  In addition, maintenance to the carts or parts by an unauthorized vendor would invalidate the warranty.    Accordingly, Versitec is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described in Section III above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing potential substantial additional cost

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest.<BR><BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated.?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(a) WARRANTIES. The Contractor warrants that -</p>
<p>(1) The unit prices set forth in the Schedule do not include allowances for any portion of the contingency covered by this clause; and</p>
<p>(2) The prices to be invoiced hereunder shall be computed in accordance with the provision of this clause.</p>
<p>(b) DEFINITIONS. As used throughout this clause-</p>
<p>(1) The term "base price" means-<br />(i) The unit price offered for an item and included in the contract award schedule; or<br />(ii) During any subsequent program year, either the effective contract price as of the start of the subsequent program year, or the price agreed upon as of the start of the subsequent program year.</p>
<p>(2) The term "base market price" means the preselected market price for an item as published on October 1, 2001. In the event one or more applicable market prices are not (or were not) published on the date shown, then the term "base market price" means the preselected market price for an item as published on the date nearest in time prior to the date show.</p>
<p>(3) The term "market price" means that published market price or combination of published prices preselected by the Government for price adjustment for individual items by product, market area, and publication as specified in (f) below.</p>
<p>(4) The term "date of delivery" means the date product is received on a truck-by-truck basis.</p>
<p>(5) The term "calendar week" means a consecutive seven-day period, beginning with whichever day of the week is specified in (c) below.</p>
<p>(c) ADJUSTMENTS. The Contracting Officer shall issue a modification to the contract to reflect any price change pursuant to this clause. The contract price shall be modified at three month periods after the date of award. The contract price will not be modified during the three month period unless the market price increases or decreases by 10% or more of the current contract price. Delivery Orders will be issued monthly at the adjusted contract price. The unit price for individual delivery orders will not be adjusted.</p>
<p>(1) DAY OF PUBLICATION. The market price in effect on the date of adjustment shall be that item's preselected market price that is published on the Monday of the calendar week in which the adjustment is made, or, in the event there is no publication in that week, it shall be the item's preselected market price as last previously published.</p>
<p>(2) CALCULATIONS. The prices payable hereunder shall be determined by adding to the award price the same number of cents, or fraction thereof that the market price increases or decreases, per like unit of measure. All arithmetical calculations, including the final adjusted unit price shall be carried to four decimal places, not rounded. <br /><br />(i) If averages are published within a given publication, then these averages will be used. <br />(ii) If averages are not available within a given publication, manually calculated averages, will be used.</p>
<p>(3) REVISION OF PUBLISHED MARKET PRICE. In the event--</p>
<p>(i) Any applicable market price is discontinued or its method of derivation is altered substantially; or</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer determines that the market price indicator consistently and substantially failed to reflect market conditions--the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate and comparable substitute for determining the price adjustments hereunder. The contract shall be modified to reflect such substitute effective on the date the indicator was discontinued, altered, or began to consistently and substantially fail to reflect market conditions. If the parties fail to agree on an appropriate substitute, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with the Disputes clause of the contract.</p>
<p>(4) FAILURE TO DELIVER. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this clause, no upward adjustment shall apply to product scheduled under the contract to be delivered before the effective date of the adjustment, unless the Contractor's failure to deliver according to the delivery schedule results from causes beyond the Contractor's control and without its fault or negligence, within the meaning of the clause Default of this contract, in which case the contract shall be amended to make an equitable extension of the delivery schedule.</p>
<p>(5) UPWARD CEILING ON ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT. The Contractor agrees that the total increase in any contract unit price pursuant to these economic price adjustment provisions shall not exceed 55 percent of the award price in any applicable program year (whether a single year or a multiyear program), except as provided hereafter.</p>
<p>(i) If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that within the near future a price adjustment under the provisions of this clause will be required that will exceed the current contract ceiling price for any item, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing of the expected increase. The notification shall include a revised ceiling the Contractor believes is sufficient to permit completion of remaining contract performance, along with appropriate explanation and documentation as required by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(ii) If an actual increase in the established catalog price would raise a contract unit price for an item above the current ceiling, the Contractor shall have no obligation under this contract to fill pending or future orders for such item, as of the effective date of the increase, until the Contracting Officer issues either a contract modification to raise the ceiling or written notification that the ceiling will not be raised.</p>
<p>(d) EXAMINATION OF RECORDS. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer or designated representatives shall have the right to examine the Contractor's books, records, documents, or other data the Contracting Officer deems necessary to verify Contractor adherence to the provisions of this clause.</p>
<p>(e) FINAL INVOICE. The Contractor shall include a statement on the final invoice that the amounts invoiced hereunder have applied all decreases required by this clause.</p>

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE SOLICITATION FOR TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL STAFFING SERVICES (TAPS): The National Administrative and Office Supplies Acquisition Center, New York, NY, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective 01/12/2012 electronically only. Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-N6-030736-B (include the dashes). 

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.12 requires prospective contractors to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov, in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Prospective contractors are not eligible for an award, if their ORCA information is not current. Additionally, prospective contractors shall update the representations and certifications submitted to the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete.  This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. The main changes to the solicitation are the implementation of the Goldstar Initiative. The Goldstar Initiative created the disclosure of current contract clauses in GSA eLibrary under each individual Schedule solicitation. FSS Contractors that have agreed to standard contract clauses without taking exception will receive a 'Goldstar' next to their name in GSA eLibrary. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous, and will contain contracts with periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusive of any options) from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to any option to extend the term of the contract, or cancelled sooner. This solicitation contains an option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with a $2,500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. Any paper offer received will be rejected as non-responsive. Paper copies of rejected offers will not be returned to the offeror. Schedule 736 is a mandatory eOffer schedule.  This is 100% set aside for Small Businesses. We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.

NOTE:  THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND OFFICE SUPPLIES ACQUISITION CENTER SCHEULE 736 PROGRAM WILL ONLY ACCEPT CONTRACTOR INITIATED MODIFICATION REQUESTS VIA THE GSA EMOD SYSTEM.  THE FOLLOWING LINK WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON UTILIZING THE EMOD SYSTEM, OBTAINING DIGITAL CERTIFICATES, AND USING THE EMOD TRAINING QUIDE: http://eoffer.gsa.gov.

<p><br />FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (January 1999). The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the service in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a purchase order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the services to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among quotes with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s).</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (May 2011). See attachment for full text and instructions for completion.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (June 2010), applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference.</p>

<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.
gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at
http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Proposals will be evaluated by a committee of technically qualified NOAA employees assisted by bureau contracting personnel in accordance with the criteria below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>A.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Factor 1 &ndash; Technical Capabilities</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">1. Criterion 1 - Adequacy of Response.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror&rsquo;s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in the proposal in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;">2. Criterion 2 - Feasibility of Approach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. <strong><em>{An assessment of the degree of confidence provided by the proposed verification</em></strong> <strong><em>approaches/methods will also be included.} </em></strong>In the event that enhancements are proposed, the enhancements will be evaluated to determine whether the approach taken is feasible and will result in an end product/service that fully meets or exceeds the RFP requirements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>B.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Factor 2 &ndash; Performance Risk Evaluation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">The Performance Risk evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy and recency of the offeror's past performance, as well as that of its major subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the offerors.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">Stated experiment encompasses the accomplishment of work by the proposer which is comparable or related to the effort required under this procurement. Past performance indicate how well the proposer did on the earlier work. (At a minimum, the contactor should list/demonstrate their experience in working with the U.S. Government in presentations at meetings/ conferences for groups of similar size to ours over the last three years.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">Cost/Price factors are those factors which indicate the adequacy and realism of the cost proposal and the probable cost that will be incurred should the Government choose to contract with the proposer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">The evaluation of cost factors will include an assessment of the probable cost of doing business with each proposer during the course of the contract. It will also include a comparison with commercial industry estimate of the cost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">Cost will not be the deciding factor when proposals are ranked in the technically acceptable range. Technical and Past Performance combined will carry more weight than Cost.</p>

(ii)	  Customer responsiveness
(iii)	  Price

Technical capability and customer responsiveness will both be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  A quote that is considered technically unacceptable or a quoter that is determined to have inadequate customer responsiveness shall be ineligible for award.  Customer responsiveness will be assessed based on past dealings between the quoter and the customer - Naval Submarine Base Point Loma.

(b) Options (not applicable).

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>CONTRACTOR TRAINING SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE <br />U.S. COAST GUARD, OFFICE OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, <br />AVIATION DIVISION (CG-1131)<br />FAA CERTIFICATIONS</p>
<p><br />1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />This effort requires the Contractor to make available quotas in the two (2) listed short term instructional courses for maintenance of the Coast Guard's Gulfstream V (GV) aircraft. All classes will require the Contractor to provide classroom instruction</p>
<p>(1) FAA Airframe and Power Plant (A&amp;P) Certification Course - up to 6 quotas <br />annually.<br />(2) FAA Inspection Authorization (IA) Certification Course - up to 2 quotas annually.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard, Chief of Aeronautical Engineering, (CG-41) is responsible for all maintenance action performed by the aircraft mechanics and aircraft technicians at Air Station Washington, D.C (AS DC). The U.S. Coast Guard employs a bi-level maintenance structure. This structure consists of depot level maintenance and organizational maintenance. The U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center located in Elizabeth City, NC coordinates depot level maintenance for all Coast Guard Aircraft. Each Air Station is responsible for completing organizational maintenance at their unit. The organizational maintenance performed by mechanics and technicians at AS DC provides safe and operable GV aircraft which are used to transport the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and other dignitaries.</p>
<p>The majority of Coast Guard aircraft are maintained and certified airworthy as a pubic aircraft under the Federal Aviation Regulations. The Coast Guard has chosen to maintain the civil aircraft airworthiness certification on its GV aircraft. As a result, the Coast Guard needs FAA certified mechanics and inspectors to maintain its GV aircraft. Traditionally, the Coast Guard would create and maintain an organic training capability for mechanics and inspectors responsible for maintaining GV Aircraft. However, since the Coast Guard operates a very limited quantity of GV aircraft, it is not cost effective for the Coast Guard to maintain an organic training capability. <br />1.3 CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL.</p>

<p>SECTION V<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman<br />Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman<br />Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.</p>
<p>If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131)<br />U S COAST GUARD<br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS<br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>(xiii) See additional document(s) for uploaded documents to support order requirements: Brand Name JOTFOC<br />(xiv) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS): N/A</p>
<p>(xv) QUOTES ARE DUE BY 4:30 PM EST Monday January 23rd, 2012; Deadline for questions will be Wednesday January 18th, 2012 @ 1:30 PM EST. Please email your quotes and questions to Iris.M.Johnson@uscg.mil.</p>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are hereby incorporated by full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

The Contractor shall be able to perform analysis on alternative specimens (other than urine); namely, hair, oral fluid, and sweat. This requirement is intended to cover any future alternative specimens which may be approved by the regulatory bodies and/or requested by the Agencies.  The Contractor shall be able to perform analysis on any drug listed in Schedule I or II of the DEA Controlled Substances Act.
The Contractor shall be required to perform and comply with all applicable provisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), "Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs", effective October 1, 2010 ; and the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (OTETA), in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOT) procedures including: 49 CFR Parts 40, 199, 219, 382, 391, 392, and 395; and 14 CFR Parts 61, 63, 65, 121, and 135, as applicable, which govern various transportation industries and the testing processes.
CONTRACT TYPE:  The requirement will be awarded as a Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract and an initial Task Order, each with a firm-fixed unit price for each line item.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The period of performance of this task order is a total of five years if all options are exercised.

After discussion with the Offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the Offeror may be found ineligible for award.<br />(c) Disclosure: The Offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that:<br />___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or<br />___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.<br />(d) Mitigation. If an Offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the Offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan.<br />(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the Offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the Offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the Offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.<br />(f) Corporation Change. The successful Offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.<br />(g) Flow-down.

<p>Professional Appearance. The Contractor's employees shall present a professional appearance at all times and their conduct shall not reflect discredit upon the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard. If the Government feels there is a problem with a Contractor's appearance; the issue will be brought to the attention of the KO who will report the issue to the Contractor.</p>
<p>Employee Conduct. <br />Contractor's employees shall comply with all applicable Government regulations, policies and procedures (e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, environmental protection, security, "off limits" areas, wearing of parts of military uniforms, and possession of weapons) when visiting or working at Government facilities. The Contractor shall ensure contractor employees present a professional appearance at all times and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States, the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Employee Identification.<br />Contractor employees visiting Government facilities shall wear an identification badge that, at minimum, displays the Contractor name, the employee's photo, name, clearance-level and badge expiration date. Visiting Contractor employees shall comply with all Government escort rules and requirements. All Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractors when their status is not readily apparent and display all identification and visitor badges in plain view above the waist at all times.</p>
<p>Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons. <br />The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from U.S. Coast Guard facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Removal does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue providing the services required under any task order awarded under this contract. The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a written explanation to support any request to remove an employee.</p>
<p>Conflict of Interest. <br />The Contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to cause a conflict of interest.</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Contractor staff shall attend Government led Privacy Act Training prior to handling relevant data and materials.</p>

<p>Professional Appearance. The Contractor's employees shall present a professional appearance at all times and their conduct shall not reflect discredit upon the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard. If the Government feels there is a problem with a Contractor's appearance; the issue will be brought to the attention of the KO who will report the issue to the Contractor.</p>
<p>Employee Conduct. <br />Contractor's employees shall comply with all applicable Government regulations, policies and procedures (e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, environmental protection, security, "off limits" areas, wearing of parts of military uniforms, and possession of weapons) when visiting or working at Government facilities. The Contractor shall ensure contractor employees present a professional appearance at all times and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States, the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS NOTICE IS BEING AMENDED TO INCLUDE TWO OPTION YEAR PERIODS.&nbsp; PLEASE SEE BELOW.<br /></strong><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to BD Biosciences, 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA 95131-1807.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch (GMBB), investigators in the Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch (GMBB) use molecular genetics techniques to identify and characterize genes involved in the normal development and function of many tissues. Additionally, researchers seek to identify disease-associated gene alterations and to understand how these genetic defects contribute to a range of human diseases, including anemia, cancer, and immune disorders. To accomplish their goal, they study the genetics of blood cells, cells of the immune system, and epithelial cells. They are particularly interested in the study of stem cells, which have the dual capabilities of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple mature cell lineages. GMBB investigators also use yeast cells as a model system to study genome replication and factors that affect genome stability and aging.</p>
<p>NHGRI/GMBB are currently using BD Biosciences FACSAria flow cytometer, which has 9-color capability and allows the user to get more information per cell from smaller sample volumes which saves time and money. This instrument is also critical for clinical applications in which the samples are rare and/or have very low cell numbers to work with. NHGRI is procuring a service contract on the FACSAria, which is both necessary and most cost effective due to the high cost of maintenance and upgrading without such an agreement. This instrument is extremely sensitive and requires multiple visits by the field engineers each year to adjust the lasers and the flow cell, which only the company can do. BD Biosciences is the sole manufacturer of the flow cytometer that requires service and can ensure the supply of spare or replacement parts which are unique to the FACSAria. BD Biosciences is the only provider that can supply instrument software revisions along with preventative maintenance inspections, technical telephone consulting and unlimited on-site service visits. No other sources is authorized to provide maintenance service to this system, must be a authorized BD Bioscience engineer or technician.</p>
<p>This purchase order will have a base year and two (2) option year periods.</p>
<p>Base: February 1, 2012 through January 31, 2013<br />Option 1: February 1, 2013 through January 31, 2014<br />Option 2: February 1, 2014 through January 31, 2015</p>
<p>The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 811219 and the associated small business size standard is $19.0 Million Per Annum. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-55 (January 3, 2011). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by January 15, 2012 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2012-056-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell. Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>
<p>Note: In order to receive an award from the NHLBI, contractors must have a valid registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov, and ORCA https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a contract modification on a sole source basis to Sikorsky Support Services Inc. to extend current support efforts under USN T-34/44/6 Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) contract number N00019-11-D-0014, which consists of tasking and equipment required for Organizational, Intermediate, and Depot-level aircraft maintenance and logistics. The resultant requirements type contract will cover performance up to&nbsp;8 months (1&nbsp;May 2012 - 31 December 2012) or for a period that will be determined at the discretion of the Navy, until performance begins on the competitively awarded T4/T44/T6 CLS contract (N00019-11-C-0056).
<p>There are approximately two hundred fourteen (214) T-34 aircraft. The T-34 is a single engine, two-place (tandem seat), unpressurized, low-wing, monoplane manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-34 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), FL, Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF), FL, and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC), TX. The T-34 aircraft are also assigned to the following satellite sites to be used for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) projects, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and as competitive exercise observer platforms: NAS Lemoore, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; NAS Oceana, VA; NAF El Centro, CA; ATTC Fort Rucker, AL; Redstone Army Airfield, Huntsville, AL; NAWCAD Patuxent River, MD; Pope AFB Fayetteville, NC; NASA Cleveland, OH; NASA Edwards AFB, CA; and Fort Eustis, VA.</p>
<p>There are approximately fifty-four (54) T-44 aircraft. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are twin-engine, pressurized, fixed-wing, five-place monoplanes manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are identical in airframe and propulsion, but the T-44C avionics have been upgraded to an integrated digital cockpit. The T-44 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi.</p>
<p>There are approximately forty (40) T-6A aircraft and&nbsp;one hundred twelve (112) T-6B aircraft. The T-6A/B aircraft are single-engine, two-place (tandem seat), pressurized, low-wing, monoplanes manufactured by Hawker Beechcraft Corporation. Both aircraft are powered by a PT6A-68 free turbine turboprop engine, flat rated at 1100 shp, manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Each aircraft is equipped with two Martin-Baker US16LA ejection seats and On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS). The T-6 is the replacement aircraft for the T-34C. The T-6 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF) and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi. The T-6 aircraft are also assigned to satellite sites (noted above for T-34), to be used for RDT&amp;E, production integration testing, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and competitive exercise observer platforms.<br /><br />NAVAIR intends to award this T-34/44/6 CLS effort to Sikorsky Support Services Inc. of Pensacola, Fl, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements). To mitigate the risk that performance on the competitive follow on contract could be delayed until 31 December 2012, award of a sole source contract to the current performing contractor is necessary in order to continue to meet CNATRA's training mission. A gap of CLS support would result in a negative impact to Naval Aviation readiness.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. This sole source synopsis is provided for informational purposes only.<br /><br />See government-wide Numbered Note 22 <br />For subcontracting opportunities please visit Sikorsky Support Services, Inc.'s website at http://www.sikorsky.com</p>

These meetings are hosted by EPA and the group is named the Superfund Remedial Action Contractors (SRAC).

The meetings do not discuss procurement actions or procurement sensitive material.</p>
<p>The SRAC meeting will be held January 12, 2012 from 1:30-3:30 p.m. The address is:<br /><br />US EPA<br />2777 Crystal Drive<br />First Floor Conference Center&nbsp;South (S-1204)<br />Arlington, VA 22202</p>

Expression of Interest Sought
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) currently occupies 7,266 net usable square feet of clinical space in a building under lease in Madison, AL, and has a requirement for a short term lease of this same size in the following delineated area.
The offered building must be located within the following boundaries:
North - Research Blvd
East - Zierdt Road
South -Contec Road
West - Intersection of Highway 20 and Research Blvd
Building cannot be within a 100 year flood plain.
The VA seeks to lease approximately 8,356 rentable square feet of clinical space located on one or two floors; if the space is located on two floors, those floors must be contiguous.  The rentable square footage should yield 7,266 usable square feet of space.  The lease term requirement is for four years with one year firm and the space must be available for occupancy by September 1, 2012.  The VA seeks a full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent).
The VA will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  In making the determination for lease award during the solicitation phase of this procurement the VA will consider, among other things, the costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs,  replication of tenant improvements and IT/telecommunications infrastructure.
Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and should include: building name, address and age; total square footage available (ANSI/BOMA) office rentable and usable, and its location within the building; date of space availability to commence tenant improvements; rental rate per ANSI/BOMA office rentable square foot (indicate core factor) (specify services and utilities included); CAD "as built" floor plans identifying the space offered; parking ratios; loading dock specifications; proximity to public transportation; and information on building ownership. (Note: The VA will pay no more than the appraised fair market rental value for space.  Usable square footage does not include areas such as stairs, elevators, mechanical and utility rooms, ducts, shafts, vestibules, public corridors, and public toilets required by local code).  
All interested parties should respond to this announcement no later than January 20, 2012 at 4:00p.m.CST.   Please include: name of firm, name of contact person, address, phone and fax numbers and e-mail address. 

 

All responses shall be made to the following:

Small business firm must be capable of self performing at least 51 percent of the work.

An IDIQ contract for Regional/Nationwide-Integrated Planning and Design Services will support a strategic effort [called VAFM] to improve facility planning, management, and acquisition by VA.

Planning studies will require an integrated, enterprise approach to strategic and capital planning, encompassing services and assets provided by Veterans Health Administration (VHA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). 

Multiple contracts will be awarded for each of the three CFM geographic support regions (East, Central, and West). (Regional headquarters are located in Silver Spring, MD, North Chicago, IL, and Mare Island, CA.)  Prime firm must have an established working office in the region, and may be awarded a contract in more than one region if the firm has a working office in that region.

Areas of expertise should include experience providing the following services: architectural design and planning; health care system planning and analysis; health care operations and management including finance, human capital and clinical disciplines; service delivery planning; facility engineering [including energy]; facility assessment; facility master planning, including environmental analysis of sensitive properties and buildings, and the use of renewable energy; project planning; cost estimating; health care thought leadership and innovation [consulting]; process management and improvement; data organization and management; meeting facilitation; and project and program communications.  In addition to health care related expertise, the team should include members with demonstrable expertise in planning burial operations and memorials, and National Shrines, and Veterans' benefits services.  Firms and/or teams should have experience with the necessary state-of-the-art information technology to accomplish analysis and documentation, and to display and integrate results and solutions with existing VA data systems and processes.
