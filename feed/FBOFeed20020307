Objective of Effort:  Define methods and principles to train soldiers/system operators to excel at their job functions as part of ad hoc teams in network-collaborative environments.  Define conditions for training them to operate through networks wi th unfamiliar soldiers in non face-to-face interactions across different organizational entities.  That is, how can training achieve horizontal integration across branches for carrying out common functional operations?  This objective will be accomplished by these tasks:  Task 1--Review, comment on, and provide recommendations for research plans that assess how performance variables in network-collaborative environments impact successful task performance.  One area of consideration will be a Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) of stimulus materials such as games.  Task 2--Recomment, based on the research literature, variables/methods that either impede or facilitate collaboration across job functions in network-collaborative environments and suggested training met hods/procedures that enhance performance in this environment.  the emphasis will be on Army network-collaborative environments.  Task 3--Provide descriptions and work-ups of future research needs pertaining to training functional competencies needed by ind ividuals to perform effectively in net-collaborative environments, including challenges envisioned with training the Future Combat System.

<DESC>THIS REQUIREMENT IS BEING ISSUED BY UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS).  THE MMS SEEKS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM PRTOSPECTIVE OFFERORS to conduct a study that requires a spatial and attributed GIS database and includes the available common carrier and gathering line information for the North Slope, Beaufort Sea, Alaska, and the Trans Alaska Pipeline (TAP).  MMS seeks data only for those pipelines that may have carried oil, although we have requested under Phase I, Task 4A, scenario C, that the Contractor prepare a proposal to include gathering lines that include all fluids.  ALL OF THE PIPELINE DATA COLLECTED WITHIN THIS STUDY WILL BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AFTER SUBMISSION TO MMS.  MMS understands that some of these data sets may not be attainable.  Therefore, under Phase I, the MMS seeks a recommendation from the Contractor with regards to the actual extent of the information that can be gathered for this project, and the cost for the delivery of these data to MMS.  THIS STUDY SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN TWO (2) PHASES.  Under Phase I, the Contractor must research the availability of the pipeline data and provide cost estimates for the possibility of Phase II implementation.  Phase II shall not proceed unless the Contractor is capable of providing documentation they can deliver to MMS the minimum required data sets as outlined under Phase I, Task 4A.  The Contractor must provide the data at or below the total cost estimate for this contract.  PHASE I OBJECTIVES: (1) Inventory data, including the type, quantity, quality and source of the spatial and attribute information for the pipeline segments for common carrier and gathering lines (oil only) for the North Slope, Beaufort Sea, and Trans Alaska Pipeline.  (2) Determine if supporting TIMS attributes can be linked to the spatial locations of the pipeline segments.  These attributes shall include, but are not limited to, the pipeline diameter, year pipeline segment built, year/date of first oil flow, wall thickness, and spe  spill detection measures.  (3) Determine if information for the MMS Technical Information Management System (TIMS) pipeline attributes can be located and incorporated into the TIMS Pipeline Database.  Determine if these attributes can be linked to the common carrier line segments.  (4) Describe how the spatial, temporal, and attribute data for the pipeline database can be adjusted to meet the data formats and data dictionary standards set forth in the attached TIMS documents.           (5) Provide a prototype pipeline database that includes the required spatial and attribute data for a segment of a common carrier pipeline and its connecting gathering lines      (see Task 3).  (6) Provide a written plan, including estimating costs for the four scenarios outlined within Phase I, Task 4A.  These cost scenarios shall include the cost for obtaining the available data and placing them into the current MMS Pipeline Database.  PHASE II OBJECTIVES:  Phase II shall proceed, subject to MMS approval and availability of funds, if the Contractor’s Final Report and inventory demonstrates under Phase I, Task 4 and 4A, they have met one of the four minimum requirements set forth under Task 4A.  The Contractor must demonstrate, by example, with the prototype under Task 3 that these data can be brought into a GIS database and conform to MMS standards.  Under Phase II the Contractor shall:  (1) Implement the plan developed in Phase I to obtain pipeline data.  (2) Develop a pipeline database and deliver the data dictionary and other required TIMS documentation to MMS within the allocated time and within budget.  Phase 1.  Task 1: Inventory Data Sources for Common Carrier and Gathering Lines.  The Contractor shall research and compile a list of government agencies, companies and individuals that have data and or the authority to provide pipeline survey data to MMS for the purposes of this study.  The contractor shall inventory spatial, temporal, and attribute information available from the public record or obtained by permission from rivate or public concerns.  At a minimum, the inventory must include the spatial, temporal, and TIMS attribute data.  The Contractor must also inventory and determine the availability of the spatial and required attribute data for the gathering lines.  See minimum requirements for gathering lines under Phase I, Task 4A, scenarios A, B, and C.  If necessary, the Contractor shall inventory the available As-Built Survey records and permit files, recording the required spatial, temporal and attribute data, the format of the data (hardcopy or digital) and the condition of the digital and hardcopy maps.  The Contractor shall provide a detailed outline of the pipeline survey data that are missing and determine the possibility of obtaining those data under Phase II of this project.  Task 2: Establish Communication Links.  The Contractor shall establish communication links with public and private entities and determine the need for any data sharing agreements.  If necessary, the Contractor shall obtain written permission to MMS authorizing the use of the pipeline survey data for the purposes set forth within this Statement of Work (SOW).  The permission statements shall provide MMS authorization to use the pipeline survey data.  ALL PERMISSION AUTHORIZATIONS MUST ACKNOWLEDGE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT DATA PROVIDED TO MMS SHALL BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN  Task 3: Development of a Pipeline Survey Database Prototype.  The Contractor shall provide to MMS a pipeline prototype database.  The prototype shall define the database structure.  The database shall be provided as comma delimited ASCII files in the format outlined in attachment H.  All spatial data shall be non-projected, NAD83 geographic, latitude and longitude, decimal, degrees.  The prototype database shall contain the available spatial, temporal and attribute data for a small segment of a North Slope, common carrier pipeline system (< 10 Km).  The prototype shall also contain spatial and attribute data on adjacent connecting gathering lines (<5 Km).  The gathering line att tes shall include information on pipeline length, pipeline diameter, year built, year/date of oil flow, year abandoned, and wall thickness.  A data dictionary shall also be provided and shall match the current MMS data dictionary. The database shall be based upon, at a minimum, one of the four acceptable scenarios outlined within Task 4A below.  Task 4: Develop Written Plan for Obtaining Data and Constructing the Pipeline Survey Database.  The Contractor must provide MMS with a written detailed plan on how they shall collect and compile spatial, temporal, and TIMS attribute data for the pipeline database.  The plan shall contain a detailed cost estimate and time frame to collect the data from the different document sources and collate the data into a pipeline survey database compatible with TIMS standards and as defined in Task 3.  The written report shall provide a detailed list of all of the available data.  The Contractor shall provide MMS with specific reasons why any requested data sets were not attainable.  Task 4A: Provide Four Cost Scenarios.  As part of the final written plan under Phase I, the Contractor shall provide four cost scenarios for the creation of a pipeline survey database for the Alaska North Slope (From NPRA to Canadian Border), Alaskan Beaufort Sea, and TAPS pipeline GIS data.  The four scenarios as identified by MMS in their order of preference as listed below.  SCENARIO A:  Spatial data (ASBUILT Table) for all common carrier lines for the first 48 attributes.   In addition, include all spatial data for gathering lines (crude oil only) and attributes within Attachment J.  SCENARIO B: Spatial data for all common carrier lines, plus all gathering lines (crude oil only).  SCENARIO C: Spatial data for all common carrier lines, plus all gathering lines (all liquids).  SCENARIO D: Spatial data for all common carrier lines with the first 48 TIMS attributes fields that define the ‘date of first oil flow”.  Scenario A is the preferred scenario for MMS acceptance and Phase II implementation.  Scena  data required for this project.  Scenarios B and C would be acceptable.  These two scenarios request all of the attributes for both common carrier and gathering line data.  Scenario B is for liquids only and Scenario C is for all fluids.  Scenario D is the least preferred of the four options because it only requests the data from the common carrier lines.  This scenario does not contain important information on the gathering lines.  MMS SHALL RETAIN ITS OPTION NOT TO PROCEED WITH PHASE II IMPLEMENTATION IF SCENARIO D IS DETERMINED TO BE THE ONLY OPTION THAT COULD BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COST FOR PHASE II.  Any scenario less than A-D SHALL NOT BE ACCEPTABLE to MMS and shall not lead to Phase II implementation.  Only those costs estimated for scenarios A-D that are within the total estimated cost for Phase II of the prospective contract shall be considered for Phase II implementation.  NOTE:  MMS shall accept a minimum of 85 to 90 percent of the spatial and attribute data for the gathering lines.  Phase 2:  Task 1. Implement Plan Approved under Phase I for Constructing a Pipeline Survey Database.  The written plan approved by MMS under Phase I, Task 4 and Task 4A shall be implemented based upon one of the four cost scenarios within Task 4A, and the approved database design within Task 3. Task 2.  Obtain Pipeline Data and Compile into a Pipeline Database.  The Contractor shall obtain digital data from planned data sources in order to create a combined North Slope, Beaufort Sea, and Trans Alaska Pipeline database.  The digital data shall be supplemented by paper copies of as-built surveys, permit files, and other documents as needed.  The paper copies of the As-Built Surveys shall be digitized as necessary, to provide the most updated spatial information on the location of the pipeline segments.  The information from the As-Builts, permit files and other documents will be collated in order to obtain the required attributes necessary to link to the spatial information associated with the pipeline segm .  The database tables shall be done as comma delimited ASCII files in a format consistent with Attachment H.  Task 3.  Development of Data Management System for Collected Pipeline Data shall be: (1) Consistent with the MMS corporate database structure; (2) Capable of point and click identification of specific pipeline segments and characteristics; and (3) Capable of query and display of pipeline segments by year.  The Contractor shall develop the database structure and field definitions that are compatible with an Oracle database and the current Gulf of Mexico pipeline database.  The spatial information shall be provided as comma delimited ASCII files.  The database documentation shall include a Data Dictionary.  Field names and definitions that are not found within the attached Data Dictionary will be added in the current database for the successful completion of the project.  All modifications to the current database structure must be approved by TIMS.  The contractor shall hold telephone and or personal meetings with Information Technology Division (ITD) as needed. The COTR will arrange for meetings with the ITD staff as needed.  CAPABILITY STATEMENTS SHALL BE EVALUATED BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:              (A) experience and expertise of all Key Personnel with the technical knowledge and experience to accomplish all of the stated tasks under Phase I and Phase II: The contractor must provide information on which task(s) each key personnel will perform and the rational for their assignment.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue Request for Quotation (RFQ) on a sole source basis to establish performance metrics, and prepare program/project up-dates and progress reports. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to contract with Performance Results Corporation (PRC) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  The NASA Software Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Facility's mission is to maintain safety for future Agency missions by minimizing risks in increasingly complex software systems.  This is accomplished by performing software independent verification and validation, and independent assessments, conducting research to improve software development methodologies and tools, and serving as the focal point for software assurance elements of the NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA).  Based on previous performance of a "requirements and gap analysis," PRC has demonstrated its capability and understanding of IV&V, and this continuum is imperative to meet our goals.  PRC's keen ability to recognize and identify IV&V's needs along with its deep understanding of IV&V's operations, requirements, systems, and personnel meets our requirements for providing the specific work in the required timeframe. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 26, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:   http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) intends to award a sole source contract to Gambit Communications, Inc., 76 Northeastern Blvd, Suite 30B, Nashua, NH, 03062.   DISA has a requirement for the immediate purchase of a MIMIC Millenia (2000-Agent) License and the MIMIC Millenia Annual Support.  (a) "Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies acquiring Electronics and information Technology (EIT) to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities.  (b) All EIT procured under this contract/order must met the following 36 CFR 1194 accessibility standards.  The full text of the accessibility standards is available at:  http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm, _X_ 1194.21 - Software Applications and Operating Systems, ___1194.22 - Web Based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications, ___1194.23 - Telecommunications Products, ___ 1194.24 - Video and Multimedia Products, ___ 1194.25 - Self-Contained, Closed Products, ___1194.26 - Desktop and Portable Computers, ___ 1194.31 - Functional Performance Criteria.  (c) The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology devise(s), but merely require that the EIT be compatible with such software and device(s) so that it can be made accessible if so required in the future.  (d) Contractors may propose products or services that result in substantially equivalent or greater access to and use by individuals with disabilities; this is known as equivalent facilitation.   This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue an award that is other than full and open competition and should not be considered a request for competitive quotations.  The determination of the Government not to open this requirement to full and open competition was made IAW 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) 1 and is solely at the discretion of the Government.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by 15 Mar 02, no later than 2:00 p.m. EST, to Franklin Wheeler, Jr., AQN2, 703-681-0902, Fax 703-681-0346, or email wheelerf@ncr.disa.mil.

<DESC>TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, FAXED, OR LETTER REQUESTS for this RFP (Request for Proposals) WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  This is a FULL-AND-OPEN-COMPETITIVE RFP.  There are TWO INCUMBENT contractors:  (a) Battelle Memorial Institute, located in Columbus, Ohio; contract number is DTFH61-96-C-00077; technical contact is Carol Zimmerman, telephone (202) 646-7808; and (b) Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), located in Vienna, Virginia; contract number is DTFH61-96-C-00098; technical contact is Mark Carter, telephone number (202) 366-2196.  In this RFP, which the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) currently estimates will be published on approximately April 5, 2002 in FedBizOpps at http://www.eps.gov, the FHWA will be seeking proposals for what will probably turn out to be two follow-on contracts for ?Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Program Assessment Support?.   It is anticipated that each such award will be a task order contract, and that each task order issued will be cost-plus-fixed-fee.  The following are examples of some of the kinds of work that might be called for, under such task orders:  (a) providing quick response support to the FHWA?s Program Manager for ITS Program Assessment; (b) performing field evaluations concurrent with ITS initiatives; (c) collecting and analyzing ITS performance, traveler behavior, benefits, costs, economic and program data; (d) synthesizing the information gathered in such field evaluations and data analyses; (e) developing and refining the tools and information needed to support the FHWA?s ITS Joint Program Office (JPO) program assessment and decision-making process; and (f) providing program assessment outreach using state-of-the-art communications technologies.  It is estimated that each resulting contract will have a two-year base period, and three option years.  TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, FAXED, OR LETTER REQUESTS FOR THIS RFP WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Instead, all prospective offerors are to obtain the RFP from FedBizOpps, at http://www.eps.gov. Any subsequent AMENDMENTS to the RFP will LIKEWISE be published in FedBizOpps at the Internet address cited above, and the FHWA does NOT plan to mail out any HARD copies of any such Amendments.  Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of each offeror to closely and frequently MONITOR FedBizOpps for any AMENDMENTS to the RFP.  Monitoring FedBizOpps for any Amendments to the RFP will be absolutely ESSENTIAL for all prospective offerors, since Amendments usually contain crucial information.  Please note that the due date shown above is merely an ESTIMATE of the date on which proposals will be due.  The ACTUAL due date for the FHWA?s receipt of proposals will be stated in the RFP.

<DESC>The Department of Justice, Facilities and Administrative Services Staff (FASS), intends to award a contract to a qualified vendor to provide and install wooden end panels on Library Bureau brand metal shelving currently located  in the 6300 and 7300 corridors of the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building (RFK) located at 950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC, 20530, and on additional  Library Bureau brand shelving yet to be installed in the 6300 corridor.  A mandatory site survey meeting is scheduled for 10:00 AM on Wednesday, March 27, 2002,  for all potential contractors to confirm the specific shelving product and determine detailed requirements for the job.  Interested parties must contact Chris Rudy on 202-514-2133 by no later than the close of business (cob) on March 22, 2002, to provide name, date of birth, and social security number of all individuals planning to attend.  The RFK is a secure facility; all contractor personnel must present two forms of identification in order to enter the building.  Following contract award but prior to beginning work on site, security clearances must be completed for all contractor personnel needing access to the site.  In addition, parking for contractor vehicles is not available on site.  Limited short term parking is available for offloading of equipment and materials only.   

The end panels must be constructed of maple wood with a custom stain to match doors currently installed in the 6300 and 7300 corridors of RFK.  Design and construction of the end panels must  accommodate existing screws in place in the current shelving and ensure secure mounting of the end panels to prevent movement after installation.  Installation of the panels also must provide  space for relocation and adjustment of the interior shelves.  Some of the shelving currently in place will require special millwork of the end panels to accommodate tight corners, wall brackets, fire alarms and other site conditions.  Some cross bars may affect the panel height.  Site conditions for shelving not yet installed in the 6300 corridor may require some adjustment of the end panels.  Cutting, trimming, planing, etc. of panels may be required on the job site to provide for those conditions.  Specific requirements, which must be verified by the contractors' site survey meeting scheduled for March 27, 2002, include: 25 Single Faced wood end panels, maple, custom stain, size 90 inches high by 14 inches wide by 1 and 3/16 inches thick, and 135 Double Faced wood end panels, maple, custom stain, size 90 inches high by 25 inches wide by 1 and 3/16 inches thick. 

Pricing proposals are requested for three types of end panels: 1)  Flat panels,  2)  Panels with a raised picture frame molding 1/2 inch high and 2 and 1/4 inches wide around the outer edge of the panel, and  3)  Panels with a raised picture frame molding 1/2 inch high and 2 and 1/14 inches wide, around the outer edge of the panel, with a molding 2 and 1/4 inches wide across the midpoint of the width of the panel.  Vendors' proposals must include a sample of the stained wood and costs for delivery and installation as separate line items.

This requirement is part of the ongoing renovation of RFK.  Because of the scheduling uncertainties accompanying such construction projects, the contractor providing and installing the end panels must be flexible in coordinating delivery and installation of the end panels with the overall RFK renovation work.  An incremental, phased delivery and installation schedule is likely to be required.  Although the actual delivery dates remain to be determined, the end panels must be fabricated and ready for delivery by no later than June 28, 2002.

Proposals must be received by no later than cob on April 5, 2002.  The FASS intends to make an award on or about April 19, 2002, of a firm fixed price order, utilizing simplified acquisition procedures.  It is the desire of FASS to issue only one purchase order to the contractor who can satisfy all the aforementioned requirements.  Quotations will be evaluated using Best Value selection procedures which seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit.  The statement of work  serves as the Government's baseline requirements; however, the following characteristics will also be evaluated to assist the Government in making a best value determination:  1) Price, 2) Quality of sample, 3)  Vendor experience completing similar installations within secure facilities, and  4) References (proposals should include a least three reference contacts with names, addresses and telephone numbers).  

Award under this solicitation is set aside for small business as described by FAR 52.219-6.  The successful offeror may be required to provide documentation confirming eligibility as a small business concern.  However, all interested parties are encouraged to submit proposals to be considered in the event that no small business concerns are responsive to this solicitation.

<DESC>International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) has a requirement, subject to the availability of funds, for a contractor to obtain quantitative data on the impact of a new Voice of America broadcasting initiative in Amman, Jordan.   The assessment will  be performed by conducting two surveys; the first to establish a baseline measure and the second to measure audience change following a period of approximately 6 months.  Quoters are herein requested to submit written price quotations and technical capabilities/experience information for conducting two audience surveys as outlined below SECTION A: Nature of Surveys.  Audience data shall be obtained through survey of Amman, Jordan.  The first survey shall be conducted as early as possible in March, 2002; the second shall be conducted around September, 2002.  The surveys shall be designed to measure the present audience for VOA programming and the change in the audience following the introduction of a new programming initiative, presently scheduled for late March or early April of this year.  Both surveys shall also collect basic information on the overall media use patterns and attitudes of the population of interest.  The interviewing shall be face-to-face and conducted in the home of the respondent by a trained interviewer. 1) General Responsibilities of the Contractor.  The contractor shall be responsible for the project design including the following specific task: a) translation, formatting, pretesting, adaptation, and printing of IBB supplied questionnaires; b) developing the sampling plan; c) training interviewers; d) supervising fieldwork; e) cleaning and encoding survey responses; f) entering and processing the data; g) ascertaining the representativeness of the sample and weighting the data, if necessary; g) preparing cross-tabulations in data books; h) submitting data on diskette; i) and communicating all necessary information and results to IBB in a timely manner. 2) Sample Design.  Interested quoters are herein requested to submit price quotations for two surveys, each with a samples of 1,000 adults age 15 or older and  representative of the population of greater Amman.  The precise area to be covered by the surveys shall be jointly determined by IBB and the contractor (awardee) for this project.  If necessary, weights shall be derived and applied to the survey data by the contractor in order to bring the sample into conformity with the characteristics of the entire population.  The sample shall be drawn using recognized probability methods, all the way down to the selection of the individual respondent at the household level.  Only one individual per household shall be selected, and at least three attempts shall be made to interview selected respondents before substitution is allowed.  A detailed Sampling Plan, including stratification criteria, description of the sampling frame, listing of anticipated Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), approximate number of interviews in each, procedures for selecting households within PSUs, and procedures for selecting individual respondents at the household level, shall be submitted to and approved by IBB prior to commencement of any fieldwork.  3) Questionnaire.  IBB will supply a set of questions for an interview of approximately 30 minutes consisting of approximately 50 questions (in English), up to 5 of which may be open-ended.  The questionnaire will be provided in draft form for suggestions and comments by the contractor. Following receipt of the contractor's cos review of any contractor comments and final approval of translations of questionnaires, the contractor shall prepare final versions in English and other languages as agreed in form suitable for use by interviewers.  4) Pre-test.  The questionnaire shall be pre-tested by the contractor prior to the commencement of any fieldwork.  At least 25 pre-test interviews shall be conducted.  The contractor shall provide IBB with a written report of the results of the pre-test, along with details of any problems encountered and suggested remedies, prior to the commencement of any  fieldwork.  5) Fieldwork. Fieldwork for the first survey shall commence on or about the first week in March 2002, and shall be completed by about the middle of that month.  It is anticipated that the second survey shall take place in September 2002; however, that date may be changed due to programming considerations.  Interviews shall be conducted by experienced field workers who shall be thoroughly briefed by the contractor prior to commencement of any work.  The contractor shall ensure that interviewers are thoroughly familiar with household and respondent selection procedures, call back procedures, and the structure of the questionnaire, including routing and filtering.  Interviewer training shall include practice sessions in administering the questionnaire.  A minimum of 10% of interviews shall be back checked and 5% shall be accompanied by a team supervisor.  The contractors' proposals shall include a description of the professional qualifications of the proposed interviewers and a description of the training that shall be provided to interviewers. 6) Data Processing.  The contractor is responsible for data entry, cleaning, and processing.  The contractor shall provide printed tabulations of results, including percentage responses to all questions broken down by gender, age group, and educational level. The tabulations shall show weighted and unweighted base for each question.  The contractor shall provide data to IBB as an SPSS for Windows syntax file (*.sps) (SPSS version 10.0 or lower) file and as an SPSS "*.sav" file with a complete data dictionary of variable names and value labels.  The contractor shall also supply raw data on computer diskettes in ASCII fixed format with accompanying codebook identifying location of all variables and coding scheme. There shall be one data record for each respondent and records shall be of fixed length.  If weights are used, weighting factors shall be in the same position on each record, with location specified in the codebook.  Each record shall include a unique respondent ID number, interviewer ID number, PSU ID number, and codes for precise location and date of interview.  Each record shall include demographic information about the respondent, including: gender, exact age, education level, and occupation. 7) Technical Appendix.  When delivering printed tabulations and raw data, the contractor shall provide a Technical Appendix which shall include the following: (a) A complete Sampling Plan, including list of PSUs and individual sampling points and number of interviews conducted in each and a map showing location of each PSU (b) Details of response rates (c) Interviewer instructions (d) A brief report on survey operations including any practical difficulties encountered in carrying out the survey (e) Estimated sampling ers complete written response to this RFQ shall be sent directly and only to the Contracting Officer for this procurement, Mr. Lesley D.

<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Special Projects Office (DARPA/SPO) researches, develops, demonstrates and transitions technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges.  SPO investments range from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems.  SPO is developing technologies to counter the emerging threat of underground facilities, used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction.  SPO is also developing significantly more cost-effective ways to counter proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, UAV's and other platforms used for weapon delivery, jamming, and surveillance.  SPO is investing in novel space sensing approaches and extremely large space structures to enable tactical sensing from space.  Finally, investments are being made in technologies to provide full-scale comprehensive collective protection systems against the threat of chemical and biological attack.  In all of these areas, SPO efforts encompass the full range of activities required to develop complete prototype systems, from hardware development and characterization to algorithms, exploitation techniques, and full-scale system experimentation.  To support this range of efforts, SPO is also home to DARPA's expertise in the areas of advanced sensor systems and guidance and navigation technologies.  SPO is soliciting innovative concepts for research efforts in several advanced technologies.  Proposed efforts may address the development of prototype components, or systems; studies and modeling of existing or proposed systems; and data collections that will overcome deficiencies in existing data.  Areas of interest include systems and component technologies to address a variety of chem/bio threats, including threats to buildings, to mass transportation nodes, to urban environments, and from mail/packages; the development of robust and complete detection systems for defense against chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents; the development of both the scientific foundation and the technologies to enable U.S. dominance over the proliferating threat posed by the use of adversarial underground structures; concepts for space-based tactical sensing including optical, infrared, radio-wave, microwave, and millimeter-wave sensors, both active and passive; novel materials and technologies to enable space operations; very large, low-cost, lightweight, and low-power-density phased arrays; ultra-wideband phased arrays; significant military capability improvement in the area of guidance and navigation; and other advanced concepts in sensors and signal processing.  Attachment 1 provides additional information and POCs for these areas of interest.  This information is provided to focus interest on innovative concepts that contribute to ongoing SPO investments, but is not meant to preclude white papers on other research efforts.  PROGRAM SCOPE  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY 02 and may occur at any time through the closing date as funds are available.  White papers and proposals determined to not be of interest under this BAA will not be considered if resubmitted unless significant changes in the approach or new technical information becomes available.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with typically no more than $1M per year.  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $25M over the time period it remains open.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  GENERAL INFORMATION  SPO is accepting white papers in response to this BAA.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offerer whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA.  A SPO Program Manager and/or technical agent most closely related to the submitted topic will review white papers and provide a written response by e-mail to the offerer within 30 days.  Those offerers whose white papers are found to be of interest and consistent with the intent of this BAA will be encouraged to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such encouragement does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award.   Those offerers whose white papers are not found to be of interest to the cognizant Program Manager and/or technical agent will be provided feedback regarding why their proposal is not of interest.  This does not preclude the offerer from still submitting a full proposal.  A minimum of 45 days will be afforded potential offeroes for submission of full proposals in response to the BAA.  All awards will be subject to availability of government funds.  Awards will be made to those offerers whose proposals are considered most advantageous to the government.  The government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) or minority institutions (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete severable areas of research for exclusive competition among the entries.

<DESC>The scope of work is designed to support the preparation of the Northern San Juan Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  The gas industry has proposed drilling infill wells on 160-acre spacing as opposed to the previously approved 320-acre spacing.  Additionally, industry is proposing this well density within the San Juan National Forest Lands within the Northern San Juan Basin.  Experience has shown that methane seepage rates along the caolbed outcrop are increaseed becsuae of Coal Bed Methane (CBM) development, and quantification of this effect is needed for the EIS.  CBM development also appears to capture groundwater discharge to local rivers.  While a study was done to model surface water depletions during field operations, future recharge conditions of the coalbed aquifer need to be investigated.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Alice Dobry to provide engineering and technical support, radio frequency licensing, and software development and administration for automated flood warning systems used by the National Weather Service.   The work requires specialized knowledge of NWS IFLOWS and AWIPS database structures; procedures for data exchange among these databases; and display of their data using Graphical Information System (GIS) software.  The work also requires a thorough knowledge of procedures for radio licensing of non-federal entities on federal radio frequencies, and establishment of databases for inclusion in the Government Master File.  Ms. Dobry is uniquely qualified to perform these highly specialized procedures due to her unparalled level of expertise developed in the successful execution of these same tasks on previous contracts.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of  their capability to respond to the requirement not later than March 21, 2002.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION TO PREVIOUS NOTICE IS ISSUED TO CORRECT THE TOTAL ESTIMATED FTEs FOR THIS 7-YEAR PROJECT TO BE A TOTAL OF 5.25 FTEs.


The Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is recompeting their current contract with Quality Biological, Inc., Contract Number N01-AI-65278.  This solicitation will be a 100% Small Business Set-Aside, NAICS Code 54171, 500 employees.  DAIDS is committed to the development of HIV/AIDS vaccines and other prevention strategies (e.g., topical microbicides) for worldwide use in stemming the AIDS epidemic. While industry, government, and academia have all targeted considerable resources to this end over the past 15 years, identification of an efficacious vaccine against HIV/AIDS has yet to be accomplished.  Therefore, the highest priority of the DAIDS continues to be the discovery and evaluation of HIV/AIDS vaccines.  In this effort DAIDS supports basic, preclinical, and clinical research to identify vaccine strategies against HIV/AIDS.   To facilitate this research, the DAIDS has long provided the research community with standardized, quality-controlled reagents through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program.  However, large-scale preclinical and clinical vaccine and prevention research studies, such as those carried out by DAIDS-sponsored Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units (SVEUs) and the expanded international HIV Vaccine/Prevention Trial Networks (HVTN and HPTN), require larger quantities of such reagents not typically available through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program.  Therefore, to advance the vaccine development process, DAIDS is seeking ways to generate and acquire reagents and technologies as needed for sponsored AIDS vaccine/prevention research and development projects.  Many such reagents are not commercially available and require customized production and quality control.  Reagents required for this research include but are not limited to viral gene products and associated peptides, adjuvants, cytokines, virus stocks, expression vectors (including recombinant plasmid DNAs and RNAs), monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, topical microbicides, and sometimes unforeseen but timely produced reagents.  These reagents will be generated for evaluating vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy.  The current Contractor supports a facility to produce or otherwise acquire these types of reagents for AIDS vaccine research and has the capability to store, maintain, assure quality control and distribute large quantities of reagents.  This contract is utilized by nearly all facets of the vaccine development program funded by DAIDS.  Grantees, contractors, and other investigators regularly make requests through this DAIDS contract to obtain essential reagents for their vaccine development studies.  In addition, novel procedures are often developed for optimizing the production of these reagents (e.g., greater yields and higher purity).  Offerors will be expected to:  1) produce (either through purchase or other means), purify, and test reagents for the DAIDS Vaccine and Prevention Research Program; these reagents include an array of viral proteins and peptides, virus stocks, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, topical microbicides, vaccine adjuvants and cytokines, and any additional reagents deemed necessary for the DAIDS vaccine program, 2) have capabilities for genetic cloning and sequencing, 3) be capable of producing and testing unique and customized reagents at the request of the program, including preparing and/or producing soluble proteins, expression vectors, and gene products (including experimental AIDS vaccines) under current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) or Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) as appropriate for their intended use, and preparing and/or producing these in large-scale production lots, 4) be able to analyze all acquired or generated reagents for purity and integrity, and to provide for their quality control and assurance, and 5) provide appropriate facilities for receipt and inventory tracking, storage, maintenance and distribution of all reagents.  The Contractor will be monitored by regular communications between the NIAID Project Officer and the contract Principal Investigator and through site visits by DAIDS staff.  NIAID will receive written reports (quarterly updates and annual reports) as well as reports of data from individual studies in progress.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of seven (7) years, beginning approximately February 14, 2003.  The total effort is estimated to be approximately 76,285 total labor hours or 5.25 total FTEs.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIDS-03-01 will be available electronically on or about March 14, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract --and will also be posted on FedBizOpps.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The scope of work is designed to support the preparation of the Northern San Juan Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  The gas industry has proposed drilling infill wells on 160-acre spacing as opposed to the previously approved 320-acre spacing.  Additionally, industry is proposing this well density within the San Juan National Forest Lands within the Northern San Juan Basin.  Experience has shown that methane seepage rates along the caolbed outcrop are increaseed becsuae of Coal Bed Methane (CBM) development, and quantification of this effect is needed for the EIS.  CBM development also appears to capture groundwater discharge to local rivers.  While a study was done to model surface water depletions during field operations, future recharge conditions of the coalbed aquifer need to be investigated. See numbered note 1.

<DESC>This request for information (RFI) is being issued for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, a synopsis of a solicitation, or a commitment on the government to later publish a solicitation or award a contract based on the information received.  The Government shall not reimburse any costs of preparing responses to this RFI.  AMC is seeking sources who can provide K-loader ramps (description follows).  This will assist the Government with future loading missions that are required to address mobility concerns.  FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) is hereby incorporated in this RFI by reference.  The NAICS code for this RFI is 332999.  Interested parties should respond to the RFI by 4:30 P.M. CST on 22 March 2002.  Responses can be e-mailed to andrew.renth@scott.af.mil or faxed to (618) 256-8316.  Questions can be directed to Andrew Renth at (618) 229-2458. 

The following is a description of the items that are needed.  The ramps are needed to un-load and off-load rolling stock from 60K Tunner loaders, 25K Southwest Mobile loaders, and 25K Halvorsen loaders.  These ramps are needed to move rolling stock on KC -10, KC -135, and CRAF aircraft at locations where there are no loading docks with a ramp in place.   We would prefer to buy existing, commercially developed systems.

The ramps must be able to handle a maximum weight of 40,000 pounds, with a maximum load of 13,000 pounds per axle.  The ramp does not need to be adjustable in height, but must fall between 39 and 48 inches at ramp's end.  Ramp angle from maximum height to ground contact should provide for a 5 percent decline if possible.  The ramp must measure around 104 inches wide if the ramp is of one solid piece.  The ramp can be two separate pieces, left and right, as long as each piece is at least 24 inches wide and each piece can be moved independently to meet the numerous wheel base requirements.  The ramp must handle axles with both common rubber tires and steel caster wheels in all weather conditions, and provide a non-skid surface.  All components of the ramp must be portable enough to be handled by three individuals.  The ramp must be capable of assembly by three individuals in a reasonable amount of time using only common tools.  All components must disassemble for the purpose of transporting by air shipment.  The ramp must be provided with a standard corrosion protection for outside use and storage.

Request contractors interested and capable of supplying ramps listed in this RFI submit the following information:  Name and address of company, business size, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, description of your product, and prices.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Operations Support Command (OSC) is seeking industry responses, comments and suggestions via a questionnaire related to the formulation of the acquisition strategy and subsequent solicitation for a proposed Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) Compe tition involving the Milan, Iowa, Lone Star and Kansas Army Ammunition Plants.  This survey can be found at http://www.osc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/lap-competition/index.htm. The OSC would be seeking a solution that will reduce the Government’s costs in the LAP sector of the industrial base.  The four installations involve extensive acreage, facilities, and infrastructure.  The OSC would desire innovative approaches in the mana gement of these installations so the costs associated with maintaining core capabilities and services are minimized.  The contractor(s) would need to have a plan to market the assets of these installations to generate revenue streams to offset operating co sts.  A contractor(s)’ solution for any competition eventually held may include some of the following elements:  consolidation of capabilities between the sites; commercialization of parts or all of the installations; increases in the facility utilization rates thru non-DoD work and/or tenant occupancy.  The OSC envisions that strategic alliances between munitions manufacturers and industrial property developers may be necessary to achieve these objectives.   The support services at these installations may include the following task requirements areas: Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support (ARMS) Program; Environmental; Fire; Government Property; Army Family Housing; Layaway of Industrial Facilities; Mat erial Management; Support of Onsite Government Staff; Pest Management; Replenishment; Safety; Security; Stocks; Traffic Management; and Utility Privatization.  We are considering both non-product and product awards that would support our core processes of:  HE melt pour, C-4 Extrusion, Pressing; Loaded Component Manufacture (e.g., manufacture of detonators), Warhead Pressing, and 40mm HE Grenade pressing and propellant loading.   At this stage, DO NOT submit ANY proprietary information.  Assume that any information you provide may be used on a non-attributable basis in the formulation of both the acquisition strategy and the solicitation.  Responses to this questionnaire are volunt ary.  Incorporation of industry feedback into any future document will be at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Responses to this questionnaire should be submitted NLT 20 March 2002, however, the Government reserves the right to continue to accept  comments/suggestions submitted at a later date.  Offers are NOT being solicited at this time as neither the acquisition strategy or the proposed solicitation has been finalized and is not released here.  It should also be noted that currently there are NO FUNDS available for this effort and short of awar d authority has not been granted.

<DESC>NA This is a market survey to determine the existence of additional sources who have demonstrated the capability to manufacture a qualified, flight tested and approved Heads Up Display (HUD), which serves as an aid to helicopter pilots using the Aviator Night  Vision Imaging System (ANVIS), AN/AVS-6, during night flight operations.  The HUD system senses critical flight data (altitude, airspeed, attitude, torque, compass heading, etc.).  This data is superimposed over the ANVIS imagery to provide the pilot with  integrated night scene and critical flight data symbology.  The HUD minimizes the requirement for the pilot to look at the flight instruments, thus allowing the pilot to concentrate his scan outside the cockpit.  This results in significant operational ad vantages and safety enhancements when performing night missions.  The overall HUD system is comprised of an “A” Kit and a “B” Kit.  This survey is only concerned with the procurement of B-Kits.  The  “B” Kit consists of the Signal Data Converters (SDC), CV -4229(V)7/AVS-7(V), NSN: 5895-01-459-3050 or the CV-4229(V)8/AVS-7(V), NSN:  5895-01-459-3051; a Converter Control Unit (CCU) C-12293/AVS-7(V), NSN: 5895-01-361-9003; and two  (2) each Display Units (DU), SU-180/AVS-7(V), NSN 7025-01-362-0980 (The Display Units may be GFE for all / a portion of this contract).  The SDC must be software reprogramable through an external connector.  The system will be form, fit, and function interchangeable with the AN/AVS-7 Heads Up Display.  Software programming will suppor t the following Department of Defense Bussed/Non-Bussed aircraft platforms: U.S. Army, CH-47D, MH-47E, UH-60A/L, MH-60; U.S. Navy, CH-53, HH-60, V-22, UH-1N; CH-46, and C-130.  The government intends to purchase the Heads Up Display using an indefinite del ivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract over a five-year period (one year base / four one year options) with an estimated total contract quantity of 200 over the five-year period.  The government will guarantee a minimum quantity of 80 systems.  Spare ci rcuit card assemblies for the SDCs listed above may also be ordered under this contract.  Scheduling is a priority.  This must be a Non-Developmental Item (NDI).  Production units must be available within six months of Statement of Work (SOW) submittal.  A cceleration of deliveries will be considered advantageous to the Government.   This is not a request for proposals.  Sources capable of producing a Heads Up Display (HUD) which meet or exceed the above requirements shall indicate in writing by specified da te to PM Soldier Equipment (Sensors),  ATTN: SFAE-SDR-SEQ (Mark Salverson), 10221 Burbeck Rd, Fort Belvoir, VA  22060-5806, email mark.salverson@nvl.army.mil.
