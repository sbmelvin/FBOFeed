The current Contractor provides mission critical logistics support services for theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center and MoffettField (MF) locations. ARC and MF include on-site and off-site Government and contracttenant organizations, as well as three areas of military housing (inside MF; outside theMF Main Gate, west of the Moffett Boulevard extension; and on Moffett Boulevard, west ofUS Highway 101). Services are currently obtained using a hybrid firm-fixed price (FFP)and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. Services provided by theincumbent contractor include: (1) supply and warehouse management; (2) equipmentmanagement; (3) mail services; (4) shipping and receiving services; (5) fleet management;(6) refuse services; (7) janitorial services; and (8) industrial property management. TheContractor provides all resources, including labor, supervision, tools, equipment,materials, transportation, and management necessary to operate logistics and specializedfunctions as described in the Statement of Work (SOW). The extension will increase the current contract value and extend the period ofperformance for five (5) months plus six (6) one-month options, for a total extendedperformance period of up to eleven (11) months, from February 29, 2012 through January31, 2013. The current contractor, Tessada & Associates, Inc., is considered the onlycontractor that can meet ARCs needs given the potentially short period of performancefor the extension. Award to another source at the same time that the evaluation ofcontractor proposals received in support of the competitive recompetition is in processwould result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected tobe recovered through competition of the extension and would not allow for a sufficientphase-in period, thereby affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptabledelays in fulfilling ARCs requirements. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact IN WRITING to the identified point of contact not later than 4 PM PST onJanuary 20, 2012. Such communication of capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

Item: Refurbishment and manufacture of PA125 Metal Containers used for packaging 25mm training ammunition, NSN: 8140-01-347-8121, Part Number: 12576143.

Refurbishment:  The contractor will be responsible for retrieving and storing field-returned PA125 metal containers from approximately 20 locations throughout the United States.  The contractor shall provide a facility capable of handling explosive materials.  The contractor shall inspect the field-returned PA125 Metal Containers and internal components to determine the degree of rework required for reuse and refurbishment.  Manufacture:  Should the number of refurbished containers not meet the Government's requirements for PA125 metal containers, the contractor will be responsible for manufacturing new containers.  Specifications:  The Technical Data Package (TDP) associated with the PA125 Metal Container is coded Distribution A, Approved for Public Release; Distribution is Unlimited.  A CD is available from the contract specialist which contains the complete PA125 TDP including all of the internal components.  This Request for Proposal (RFP) is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside and will result in a five-year, firm-fixed-price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  Because the exact number of PA125 Metal Containers needed over the next five years is not known, the Government will be awarding an IDIQ contract with delivery orders.  A First Article Test will be required.

This plan provides for monitoring all contract requirements through checklist surveillance.<br><br>1.2 The objective of this surveillance plan is to evaluate how the contractor is performing in key areas. The government is primarily interested in the final product or service the contractor is providing and not in details of how he is doing it.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>HOW TO USE THE SURVEILLANCE PLAN<br><br>2.1 The QAE is responsible for using the surveillance plan.<br><br>2.2 It is the QAE's responsibility to perform monthly surveillance to verify contract tasks are being satisfactorily performed in compliance with contract specifications. The checklist included at Section 4 of this plan will be used to record information pertaining to each inspection. The Contracting Officer must be able to observe the QAE's performance by review of these monthly inspection checklists. The government should be able to conduct a complete audit trail from the monthly inspection checklists and an auditor or inspector should be able to track from the above checklist to the contract administrator's actions, payment deductions or other actions as necessary, described on a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR).<br><br>2.3 Checklists will be prepared for each inspection and will be used to record information on observation and defects. These documents will then become a formal government record for later reference. Discrepancies detected during the course of surveillance will require corrective action by the contractor. Specifics concerning any errors should be recorded on the back of the checklists. The QAE should verbally tell the contractor's representative when discrepancies are found and ask him to correct the problem. A notation will be made on the checklist of the date and time the deficiency was discovered and the date and time the contractor's representative was notified. The contractor's representative should be asked to initial this entry.<br><br>2.4 If at the conclusion of the month's inspection, the contractor's performance is judged unsatisfactory due to his failure to correct deficiencies and/or failure to comply with the contract specifications, the contractor will be given a CDR. The QAE will prepare the CDR for signature of and release by the Contracting Officer. When completed and signed, the CDR along with the monthly checklists become documentation supporting payment, reduced payment, nonpayment or other actions as necessary. At the end of each month the QAE shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing if contract performance was satisfactory or unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory determination requires written documentation to include inspection checklists to support the unsatisfactory rating. Recommended deductions in payment will include the method used to compute the proposed amount.<br><br>2.5 During the course of the month, the QAE may receive customer complaints about the quality of service. Procedures for the use of the customer complaint record are at Section 3. Each complaint received shall be validated by the QAE.<br><br>2.6 Revisions to this surveillance plan are the joint responsibility of the QAE and the Contracting Officer.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>CUSTOMER COMPLAINT GUIDE<br><br>3.1 Complaints will be used as additional evidence that performance was lacking. Complaints will not, in themselves, be counted against the contractor's performance standards for purposes of payment deductions.<br><br>3.2 When a complaint is received, the QAE will complete a customer complaint record (see 3.4) and investigate the complaint. If the QAE is satisfied the complaint is valid, he will notify the contractor of the defect. The contractor will be required to correct valid complaints of performance not in compliance with the contract.<br><br>3.3 The QAE will retain the complaint form in the QAE files. At the end of each month a copy of all validated complaints will be forwarded to the Contracting Officer.<br><br>3.4 Customer Complaint Record<br> <br>CUSTOMER COMPLAINT RECORD<br><br><br><br>DATE AND TIME OF COMPLAINT:<br><br><br><br>SOURCE OF COMPLAINT:<br><br><br><br>NATURE OF COMPLAINT:<br><br><br><br>VALID COMPLAINT: 		YES ( ) 	NO ( )<br><br><br><br>CONTRACT REFERENCE:<br><br><br><br>DATE AND TIME CONTRACTOR NOTIFIED OF COMPLAINT:<br><br><br><br>ACTION TAKEN BY CONTRACTOR:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>RECEIVED AND VALIDATED BY:<br> <br>Section 4<br><br>SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITY CHECKLIST<br><br>4.1 Surveillance of services will be conducted by use of surveillance activity checklist.

THE<br>GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE OR MODIFY <br>INSPECTION METHODS AND FREQUENCIES.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>1.1 This Contract Administrator's Surveillance Plan has been developed to aid in providing effective and systematic surveillance of this contract. This plan is to be used in conjunction with the Quality Assurance Evaluator's Surveillance Plan.<br><br>1.2 While the QAE may inspect the contractor's performance and document noncompliance actions, only the Contracting Officer may take formal action against the contractor for unsatisfactory performance. Section 2 of this plan "Government Actions for Contractor Deficiencies" lists actions to be taken by the Contracting Officer when contractor deficiencies are discovered.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>GOVERNMENT ACTIONS FOR CONTRACTOR DEFICIENCIES<br><br>2.1 The actions listed below are the normal steps to be taken when the contractor's performance is found deficient by the QAE. When the contractor's performance fails to conform to the requirements of the contract and formal action is contemplated, the QAE, the functional area chief and the Contracting Officer will meet to determine if the action is appropriate for the specific circumstances. If a decision is reached not to take the action listed, the reasons will be documented. The Contracting Officer must indicate agreement with the decision by signing the Contract Discrepancy Report or other decision documentation.<br><br>2.2 Normally, the QAE will verbally tell the contractor's project manager of discrepancies the first time and ask the contractor to correct the problem. A notation will be made on the tally checklist of the date and time the deficiency was discovered and the date, the time and the name of the contractor's project manager notified.<br><br>2.3 When the contractor is responsible for unsatisfactory performance, a contract discrepancy report (CDR) will be issued to the contractor. The seriousness of the problems should govern whether to issue the CDR at the end of the month or as soon as the problems are discovered. Any discrepancies caused by the government will not be counted against the contractor's performance. When the government has caused the contractor to perform in an unsatisfactory manner, a letter will be written to the responsible government organization requesting corrective action is taken.<br>2.4 When services to be performed by the contractor are of such a nature that the defect cannot be corrected by re-performance of the services, the government will have the right to require the contractor to take immediate steps to ensure future performance of services are in conformity with contractual requirements and to reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.<br><br>2.5 If the contractor fails to achieve satisfactory performance by the end of the next month or agreed suspense date, another CDR will be issued and the appropriate amount deducted from the contractor's payment. A third CDR should be the cause for consideration of a cure notice.<br><br>2.6 Depending on the overall performance of the contractor, an unsatisfactory reply to a cure notice should require issuance of a show cause letter followed by consideration to terminate the contract.<br><br> <br>Section 3<br><br>SURVEILLANCE OF THE QUALITY ASSURANCE EVALUATOR (QAE)<br><br>3.1 The Contracting Officer's check of the QAE will be done by joint surveillance with the QAE.<br><br>3.2 Surveillance will be accomplished through periodic review of the QAE's checklist. Checklist items must be reviewed at least once a year with the QAE. A record of the surveillance will be made and the record will become a permanent part of the Contracting Officer's file. The contract administrator may make independent reviews of the contractor's performance.<br><br>3.3 The amount of surveillance specified will provide the Contracting Officer with sufficient "direct loss" knowledge of the contractor's performance to promote sound decisions if government actions are indicated. This surveillance should ensure the Contracting Officer of the QAE's performance.<br><br>3.4 During the surveillance checks, the Contracting Officer will verify that the QAE is performing inspections in accordance with the QAE's surveillance plan. Observations of one or two checks will be sufficient to verify the QAE's procedures. If defects are discovered in the QAE's performance, the Contracting Officer will notify the functional area chief and ensure the QAE receives the proper training.<br>

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) intends to award a sole source purchase order to The King Center, 449 Auburn Avenue, NE, Atlanta, GA. 30312 for the effort entitled, The King Youth Empowerment (K.Y.E.) Youth Violence Prevention Discussion Summit. <br /><br />The authority for this sole source is FAR Part 6.302-1. The NAICS code is 813410, Civic and Social Organizations. The work involved with this project is to conduct the King Youth Empowerment (K.Y.E.) Youth Violence Prevention Summit (the Summit). The Summit will focus on the non-violence teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr as applied to the problems of Teen Dating Violence, Bullying, Youth Violence, and Gang Initiation Rituals. The Summit will be held on January 7, 2012, to coincide with the month of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr's birth, and will take place in Atlanta, Georgia, Dr. King's home. <br /><br />The King Center is the only responsible source capable of providing the King Youth Empowerment (K.Y.E.) Youth Violence Prevention Summit. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr was a civil rights leader, recognized proponent of non-violence, and community outreach leader. The King Center was founded to carry on Dr. King's legacy and share his teachings. The King Center holds the intellectual property rights to proprietary "Kingian" youth non-violence training. Since the Summit will focus on the teachings and personal philosophy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. this proprietary training is essential. No other organization can tie the philosophy of non-violence as exemplified by the life of Dr. King, to the issues of Teen Dating Violence, Bullying, Youth Violence, and Gang Initiation Rituals as effectively as the King Center. <br /><br />In addition, Dr. King's Civil Right's legacy gives the King Center unparalleled influence in the Atlanta community, the site of the Summit. Dr. King's Civil Right's work provides The King Center with particularly strong ties to Atlanta's minority community, many of whom stand to benefit from the Summit. The King's Center's unparalleled influence in the Atlanta Area will allow the message of the the Summit to have a greater impact on the community than would otherwise be possible. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to The King Center. However, firms that believe they can provide these services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contracting Office by December 16, 2011.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Vallerie Redd by email at gfj3@cdc.gov. and reference solicitation #06329 on the subject line.<br />

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Work will be issued by individual task orders not to exceed the contract amount. The contract is anticipated to be awarded in the March to April timeframe.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This Sources Sought Synopsis is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing AFGLSC/401 SCMS or its successor organization(s). Please review, in this order, the Sources Sought Synopsis, the Performance Work Statement (PWS), and the Capabilities Matrix spreadsheet.
<p>The scope of AFGLSC's enterprise-wide responsibilities includes analyzing, operating, maintaining, and enhancing COLT, PDL, RBL, support equip. systems, ASM, RMS, EXPRESS, and HVM. Because of the highly technical nature of the above mentioned systems, AFGLSC needs contractor support to provide the specialized analytical skills necessary to operate, maintain, and enhance COLT and integrate it into the AFGLSC's enterprise-level processes. The Air Force installations where service will be provided may require contractor personnel to travel to these locations.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates the period of performance will be approximately 1 year, beginning in CY12. The Air Force anticipates this acquisition will utilize procedures outlined in FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541519, size standard $25,000,000.00. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their CCR. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. Interested contractors shall review, fill-in and return the attached Capabilities Matrix and may also submit a 10-12 page capabilities document. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements. Statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to ASC/PKEIE. Statements should be submitted no later than 1 Feb 2011 at NOON EST.</p>
<p>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS RFI.</strong>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI). The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about commercially available solutions that meet the requirements outlined below and can provide the functionality of a <strong>Internet Data Collection and Processing system</strong> for use by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to conduct investigations which involve the legal intercept of electronic communications with content (Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968), and information about electronic communications (Pen Register Trap and Trace - also known as PEN). This is not a RFI for Research and Development (R&amp;D) or systems that may be developed at DEA expense, but rather a request for inputs about systems that are commercially available and meet most if not all of the requirements specified in this document.<br /><strong>Term Notes:</strong> <strong>In the context of this RFI the term: <br /></strong>- "provider" refers to a company or business offering electronic communication services such as telephone, cellular, internet, email, VOIP, etc. <br />- "target" is used to reference a single lawfully monitored entity which may be associated with communications identifier such as an IP address, phone number, account number, web site, email address, etc. <br />- "case" is used to represent a container for multiple "targets" by which the "targets" may be associated with each other in such a way as to share/deny access to collected data as well as provide a contextual frame of reference for the collected data. <br />- "processing" refers to the reassembly of packet data into the original files or xml formatted representations of the original files; or the parsing and/or transformation of structured text (xml or delimited) and unstructured text files into individual file representations of the intended data types (email, html, documents, etc.). <br />- "automatic" or "automatically" refers to a file or data processing operation which occurs without human intervention beyond initial configuration.<br />- "monitor" or "monitoring" refers to the loading, collection, and/or processing application waiting for the arrival of new input to a folder (directory) in a file system or operating system port and acting upon the newly arrived data automatically.<br />- "Processing Solution" refers to the subject of this RFI, which is a system that can provide the functionality of a lawful Internet Data Collection and Processing system.<br />- "original data" or "source data" refers to the data as it was provided to the "Processing Solution" from the provider or other source external to the "Processing Solution"<br />- "administrative user" refers to a user that is granted the authority to have full access to all administrative functions (configuration (monitors, logs, outputs, etc.), log viewing, adding other users, etc. ) of the "Processing Solution"<br />- "CALEA" and "CALEA standard"- refers to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (passed in 1994) and its associated standards for data capture and delivery to law enforcement. Please visit http://www.askcalea.net/standards.html for more information.<br />- "3rd Party" - refers to any commercial or government organization that is not the owner/creator/ vendor of the "Processing Solution"<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>REQUIREMENTS <br />Data Collection and Processing<br /></strong>1. The "Processing Solution" shall accept and process cellular (mobile) provider data inputs<br />a. Accept as input a single TCP data stream (to a monitored port) from a provider that contains cellular packet data for multiple numbers ("targets") and process the data into the original files or products that correspond to the original files (such as XML with content and schema). <br />i. Segregate the input stream by individual phone number ("target") for configuration management and output<br />ii. Provide each individual number's processed data as a structured data file output such as XML or delimited text that is, or fully represents, the original data. This is a requirement to allow other 3rd party viewing or analytical systems to ingest the data post processing.<br />iii. File output must occur near real time from reassembly (processing) completion<br />iv. Each file output from processing must have a corresponding hash value generated by a SHA-2 algorithm at the time it is created. The generated hash value must be persisted in such a way that it can be easily related back to its parent file. <br />i. Input and output configuration and management must provide for the means to model the case/target container structure and be fully configurable by an administrative user.</p>
<p>b. Perform item 1(a) for multiple providers (one stream for each) in multiple CALEA or other telecommunications standards including but not limited to the following <br />i. TCP/FTP stream - ATIS/3GPP <br />ii. TCP Stream - T1.IAS<br />iii. TCP Stream - ETSI <br />iv. TCP Stream - J STD 025B</p>
<p>2. The "Processing Solution" shall monitor for and process known (see 2a-2e) data files from any number of folders in a file system, or from ports, into the original files or products that correspond to the original files (such as XML with content and schema) and be written into equivalent data folders ("targets") on a file system. For example, the "Processing Solution" shall accept and process data from a folder on the file system called "\inputSample\JoeSample" and output to a specified folder called "\outputSample\JoeSample". Known data files and types include:<br />a. PCAP, CAP, and PKT file output from IP collection tools such as "Wildpackets" or "Wire Shark" or other software.<br />b. Email - RFC 5322, RFC 5321, RFC 2822, RFC 822 <br />c. XML document files with agreed upon schemas which represent a file or product type acceptable by the "Processing Solution". Such XML files may represent, but are not limited to IP logs, email messages, text messages, chat messages, or other forms of communication or information about communications<br />d. XML document files with agreed upon schemas and their associated support files pointed to by the xml document , which represent a file or product type ingestible by the "Processing Solution". For instance an XML file which represents a text message may have associated attachments such as photos or documents that are pointed to by the xml file.<br />e. Delimited text files or other structured text files that contain single or multiple items which represent single or multiple files or product types which are acceptable by the "Processing Solution". Such text files may represent, but are not limited to IP address logs, email messages, text messages, chat messages, or other forms of communication or information about communications<br />f. File monitoring shall be automatic and continuous or at a very short interval (under a minute)<br />g. File output must be automatic and occur near real time from processing completion.<br />h. Each file output from processing must have a corresponding hash value generated by a SHA-2 algorithm at the time it is created. The generated hash value must be persisted in such a way that it can be easily related back to its corresponding file. <br />i. Input and output configuration and management must provide for the means to model the case/target container structure for this output in a file system and be fully configurable by an administrative user.</p>
<p>3. The "Processing Solution" shall be able to accept and process files as described in item #2 on demand by an administrative user.</p>
<p>4. The "Processing Solution" shall be capable of automatically extracting all relevant metadata from the original source data and outputting it as structured text like xml for loading to other 3rd party systems for viewing, reporting, analysis, etc. This relevant metadata (when available) shall include: <br />a. Associated IP addresses (source/destination/origination)<br />b. Associated URL(s) or host name information (source/destination)<br />c. Associated user names, handles, or email addresses included as senders or recipients of the source communication<br />d. Product Dates (sent, received, timestamps)<br />e. Source file information (source or original file name if any, creation date, etc) <br />f. File type or category that allows for easy identification of the output (examples: EMAIL, IMAGE, HTML, TEXT MESSAGE, CHAT, IP LOG)<br />g. Other file source information</p>
<p>5. The "Processing Solution" shall provide configurable logging for monitoring, processing and loading as well as error recording and also provide administrative access to the logs.</p>
<p><strong>Data Organization and Reconstruction<br /></strong>6. The "Processing Solution" shall be able to represent a "case"/"target" model for setup, monitoring, loading, persistence, output, organization, and user/administrative security. See the "Term Notes" under the "Synopsis" for the definition of "case/target" in this context.</p>
<p>7. The "Processing Solution" shall reconstruct and output collected data as files in such a way that it is precisely, or very closely, representative of the data as it existed at its source or origin. For Example: <br />a. Reassembled web page data shall be or precisely represent the original web page with associated products (images, audio, documents, links, etc) and viewable in a 3rd party browser or browser like viewing experience. NOTE: Uncollected data that was not contained in the original inputs (streams, pcap files, etc) such as images, supporting pages, videos, audio, etc, shall never be downloaded from the Internet to fill in uncollected information.<br />b. Reassembled image data shall be whole (as collected) and output as an image file in the same format as it was originally collected or in a precisely representative format and viewable in a 3rd party viewer that supports the format type.<br />c. Audio data shall be reassembled whole (as collected) and output in a file format and audible in a 3rd party media player that supports the format type.<br />d. Video data shall be reassembled whole (as collected) and output in a file format that is viewable, and audible in a 3rd party media player that supports the format type. <br />e. Chat data shall be reconstructed and output in such a way as to represent a "conversation" (to the extent possible during the collection and reassembly period) in a structured text format like xml that can provide for association of chat participants, attachments, and messages that are part of the source data.<br />f. Text Message (as distinct from chat) data shall be reassembled and output as a "conversation" (to the extent possible during the collection period) in a structured text format like xml that can provide for association of participants, attachments, and messages that are part of the source data.<br />g. Email data shall be reassembled or parsed and output in such a way as to be viewable in a third party viewer with all the source data and meta data to include recipients, sender, date, subject, and content (when present) with attachments (if present). Email shall be rendered in a structured text format like xml or as the current standard in item #2b (.eml file).<br />h. Other types of content data not described in items 6a-6g shall be reassembled in a similar fashion to precisely represent their origin.</p>
<p>8. Log, Session, and other human to machine, machine to human, or machine to machine communication meta data shall be reconstructed as structured text (xml, csv) and viewable in 3rd party application that supports the format.</p>
<p>9. Source or original pre-processed data and metadata (when persisted) shall be made available as file output on demand by an administrative user. This applies in particular to any potential "Processing Solution" that persists the original and pre-processed data (and metadata) in a database or similar relational storage mechanism. This is separate functionality from the "real-time" post processing output.</p>
<p>10. The "Processing Solution" shall keep and not destroy or dispose of data that was not recognized, decoded, decrypted or reassembled properly by the processing mechanisms. Furthermore it shall organize and persist the data in such a way as to be recognizable as unclaimed or unknown data and viewable as source data (in a hex viewer or other suitable binary viewer) to an Administrative user.</p>
<p>11. The "Processing Solution" shall provide all file output as either the source data file as intercepted (examples: .eml, .htm(l), .jpeg, .mpeg, .txt, etc) or in a non-proprietary (not encoded, encrypted, or serialized) structured text format (xml, csv) that represents the complete source file.<br /><br /><strong>Application Scalability and Portability<br /><br /></strong>12. The "Processing Solution" shall provide cellular data stream auto processing (see item #1) in the following ratios and times:<br />a. Process one to n-number of "targets" from a single stream to a monitored port from a single provider<br />b. Provide for item 9(a) for m-number of providers<br />c. Process data in near real time (from when it is received at the processing point)<br /><br />13. The "Processing Solution" shall provide PCAP, CAP, PKT, Email and other "known" structured file type input and auto processing (see item #2 ) in the following ratios and times:<br />a. Process n-number of files from a monitored "target" folder or port in near real time or in the case of files at a configurable interval which can approach near real time.<br />b. Provide for item 10(a) for m-number of "targets" contained within l-number of "cases"<br />c. Process data in near real time (from file receipt)<br /><br />14. The "Processing Solution" shall provide manual file processing (see item #3) in the following ratios:<br />a. Processes n-number of files selected by an administrative user from a single folder for a single "target" on demand <br />b. Provide for file processing for all files in a folder selected by an administrative user<br /><br />15. The "Processing Solution" shall run on Microsoft Windows 2008 Server (64bit) and any generations which follow and preferably be capable of running in a virtualized environment.<br /><br /><strong>Data Transportation and Storage Integrity<br /><br /></strong>16. Provide for file hashing at the point of first receipt or where first created by the "Processing Solution" and persist the generated file hash in such a way as it easily identifiable with its mated file.<br /><br />17. Ensure that the first file created at point of receipt (in the case of port inputs) is kept unaltered and separate from processed data and provide a means for verifying that it is unaltered (See item 14.)<br /><br />18. Provide for file hashing at processing output point and persist the generated file hash in such a way that it is identifiable with the mated output file.<br /><br /><strong>Additional Administrative Functionality<br /><br /></strong>19. The "Processing Solution" shall provide a graphical user interface which runs on Microsoft Windows, or in a Browser supported by MS Windows, through which an administrative user can perform administrative maintenance, setup, and configuration of the "Processing Solution". For example: configure cases and targets; setup monitored folders and ports with appropriate input data type associations and output folders; add and delete users; view log files; load and process data; etc.<br /><br />20. The "Processing Solution" shall provide a mechanism for another software application to supply administrative information for setting up and maintaining configurations for monitoring, processing, and output. This should be accomplished through an Application Programming Interface (API) or exposed methods made available through a service like a web service. A fully capable API is preferred.<br /><br />21. The "Processing Solution" shall provide a means of backing up and restoring all of the configuration data which is necessary for it to be recovered and fully operational without manually re-entering all of the configuration data.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB-Zone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey only to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses of various types such as veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUB-Zone small businesses. Interested small business must be capable of serving the needs identified below and must possess the necessary skills as identified.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541512 with a small business size standard of $25 million. This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.</p>
<p>1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, is the world's largest medical library. The NLM collects materials in all areas of biomedicine and health care, as well as those dealing with biomedical aspects of technology, the humanities, and the physical, life, and social sciences. Most of these resources are available for no charge via the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>The NLM Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) produces information resources on a range of topics covering toxicology, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, drug and consumer product information, and disaster/emergency preparedness and response. The Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP) component covers toxicology, environmental health, and chemistry. The Outreach and Special Populations Branch (OSPB) seeks to improve access to quality and accurate health information by underserved and special populations. The Disaster Information Management Research Center (DIMRC) helps provide online and downloadable information resources relevant to national emergency preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. SIS also coordinates many of the National Library of Medicine's HIV/AIDS information activities.</p>
<p>SIS is responsible for a collection of databases and related information on environmental health and toxicology. Some of these resources are created in SIS; others originate from a variety of national and international agencies and associations.</p>
<p>With a strategic goal to facilitate and encourage use of high-quality information, NLM has an interest in exploring alternate ways to make its information more compelling and understandable to a broad audience through integration of data from reputable health data sources and via visual data presentation techniques.</p>
<p>One approach to facilitate better understanding of database content and to enhance the translation from data into knowledge is the integration and display of data from different health data sources into a geospatial presentation. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) use visualization by electronically capturing, storing, analyzing, and displaying geographically referenced information (data identified according to location).</p>
<p>One SIS resource, TOXMAP (http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov), currently uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and Superfund Program, as well as data from the US Census (population information), the Bureau of Economic Analysis (income figures), the National Cancer Institute (http://www.cancer.gov/), and the National Center for Health Statistics (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/). TOXMAP provides a map-based gateway to relevant bibliographic references and to other data resources about the TRI and Superfund chemicals.</p>
<p>TOXMAP has provided SIS with a solid understanding of the extensive potential of GIS. Since TOXMAP was first developed, the range and scope of SIS products has expanded, as has the capabilities of GIS. In addition, SIS has founded the Disaster Information Management Research Center (DIMRC) to help with national emergency preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. DIMRC is tasked with the collection, organization and dissemination of health information resources and informatics research related to disasters of natural, accidental, or deliberate origin. Many of the topics managed by DIMRC lend themselves to geographical interpretations.<br />&emsp;<br />2.0 PURPOSE and OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The NLM Specialized Information Services (SIS) Division is seeking professional services to collaborate with SIS staff to provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Professional geospatial expertise, development and support for selected SIS resources, topics, and initiatives<br />&bull; Maintenance of TOXMAP 4.x (http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov/)<br />&bull; Continued development and ongoing maintenance of TOXMAP 5.x</p>
<p>3.0 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent for the federal government, the contractor will provide to the NLM/SIS qualified and experienced personnel and GIS expertise and implementation services for mapping and related analytical activities related to its resources and services, continued maintenance of the current TOXMAP 4.x system, and development and maintenance of TOXMAP 5.x.</p>
<p>In general, Contractor tasks will include, but not be limited to:<br />&bull; Following progress and reporting on advances in GIS, environmental health, and disaster health applications<br />&bull; Working closely with SIS staff and other stakeholders in determining possible new GIS projects, goals, and priorities related to its numerous resources<br />&bull; Providing geospatial expertise, development and support for selected SIS resources<br />&bull; Maintaining and updating the current TOXMAP 4.x <br />&bull; Continuing development and maintenance of the new TOXMAP 5.x.<br />&bull; Ensuring that SIS GIS products meet all HHS/NIH/NLM standards for a public government web site, including ADA compliance for accessibility. The contractor will be proactive in ensuring that the function, maintenance and design of web sites conform to OMB Policies for Federal Public Websites (http://www.firstgov.gov/webcontent/reqs_bestpractices/omb_policies.shtml) and Requirements and Best Practices Checklist for Government Web Managers (http://www.firstgov.gov/webcontent/reqs_bestpractices/reqs_checklist.shtml), and practices for web sites, and be familiar with the primary government source for information on usability and user-centered design (http://usability.gov/) and other applicable government standards.<br />&emsp;<br />A. Geospatial Expertise, Development and Support for Selected SIS Resources</p>
<p>The Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) produces information resources on a range of topics covering toxicology, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, drug and consumer product information, and disaster/emergency preparedness and response.</p>
<p>The Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP) component covers toxicology, environmental health, and chemistry. The Disaster Information Management Research Center (DIMRC) helps provide online and downloadable information resources relevant to national emergency preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. The Outreach and Special Populations Branch (OSPB) seeks to improve access to quality and accurate health information by underserved and special populations. SIS also coordinates many of the National Library of Medicine's HIV/AIDS information activities.</p>
<p>Each of these areas develops and maintains health resources for health professionals and for the public and is interested in the use of innovative communication technologies like GIS.</p>
<p>In pursuit of this end, the contractor shall:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide expert level GIS capabilities which enables SIS to respond to relevant and topic-based events in a time-sensitive manner, with geospatial representations and other spatial solutions including static maps, spatial analysis, and web-based mapping tools<br />&bull; Provide expert advice and implementation services for mapping and related analytical activities<br />&bull; Emphasize use of open source and web-based technologies.</p>
<p>B. Maintenance of TOXMAP 4.x<br />TOXMAP 4.x was designed in 2002 with ESRI ArcIMS software. ESRI is no longer updating ArcIMS; TOXMAP is currently undergoing a redesign using ESRI ArcGIS (with ArcSDE and Tomcat) server software, PostgreSQL database, and web services. It is anticipated that after public release of TOXMAP 5.x, TOXMAP 4.x will be frozen-- only its data will be updated.<br />&bull; Integrate updated data sources (e.g. EPA, National Atlas) as they become available and report on their accuracy<br />&bull; Maintain TOXMAP 4.x software/hardware and everything under "Spatial Tier" and "Data" (see attached "TOXMAP System Requirements")<br />&bull; Utilize currently used technologies, including ArcIMS, Java, Servlets, JSP, Tiles MySQL, SOAP and Struts<br />&bull; Work with SIS system administration staff on hosting issues<br />&bull; Coordinate and conduct software and data releases to SIS staging and production servers throughout project lifecycle<br />&bull; Coordinate functional testing, load testing, and cross-browser testing; conduct functional testing<br />&bull; Capture and track requirements for 1)software and data enhancements 2)defects and problems <br />&bull; Maintain current problem reporting/tracking process (currently in Scarab/ http://www.solitone.org/scarab-021-doc/)<br /><br />C. Development and ongoing maintenance of TOXMAP 5.x<br />Since TOXMAP 4.x was first deployed, GIS has flourished and is used by a wider online audience. Users' expectations of web mapping systems have been re-defined by the widespread use of Google Maps, which feature dynamic map behavior and a rich user experience. Concurrently, ESRI has ceased development of ArcIMS, on which TOXMAP 4.x is built, and has migrated toward ArcGIS Server and rich client development with Adobe Flex or other client technologies. SIS is now developing an updated, "next-generation" TOXMAP 5.x that leverages these technologies.<br />&bull; Provide full development lifecycle support <br />&bull; Design user interface and map presentation changes as new types of desired data and maps are identified<br />&bull; Integrate updated data sources (e.g. EPA, National Atlas) as they become available and report on their accuracy<br />&bull; Make architectural and design changes as functional and non-functional requirements demand<br />&bull; Maintain TOXMAP problem reporting/tracking process and data import/review process<br />&bull; Work with SIS system administration staff on hosting issues<br />&bull; Maintain TOXMAP 5.x software/hardware (including ESRI ArcGIS Server and Flex technologies)<br />&bull; Coordinate and conduct software and data releases to SIS staging and production servers throughout project lifecycle<br />&bull; Coordinate functional testing, load testing, and cross-browser testing; conduct functional testing<br />&bull; Capture and track requirements for 1)software and data enhancements 2)defects and problems <br />&bull; Implement interface, develop ideas for TOXMAP 5.x:<br />o Identify capabilities and features for TOXMAP 5.x based on discussions with SIS and NLM staff, feedback from the public and other NLM partners, and the Contractor.</p>
<p>o Use this input to continue developing and enhancing the TOXMAP 5.x web site. Enhancements to be delivered will start with informal presentations of ideas and may include simple conceptual sketches to illustrate ideas.</p>
<p>o Provide a technical brief/preliminary detailed design document that outlines the recommended technology changes (if any), including an impact analysis report, and how changes would be applied. The specification shall provide details sufficient for efficient and unambiguous implementation of the interface elements. The contractor will then take approved ideas and sketches and provide plans, workflow and timelines for approval.</p>
<p>o Based on requirements, the contractor will do all software engineering, programming, testing and development necessary to integrate new content on the public web site. (In general, subject content --chemical information, web links, etc.--will be provided by SIS.) Development will be in alignment with the existing TOXMAP architecture and infrastructure.</p>
<p>D. TOXMAP Software/ Hardware</p>
<p>The public TOXMAP4.x and 5.x web sites will be maintained at SIS/NLM and the contractor will work cooperatively with SIS technical staff to ensure public access to the latest version of TOXMAP in compliance with SIS system requirements. The contractor will work closely with SIS in maintaining the production versions of TOXMAP within the current architecture of SIS servers for public access through NLM web resources.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought request for information
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NOAA Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Marine Mammal Laboratory is seeking a contractor to provide a charter vessel (including crew) for up to 33 days during Aug - Sep 2012.</p>
<p>The vessel will transport up to 15 scientists for 29 days to conduct passive acoustic monitoring studies and oceanographic sampling to determine abundance, migratory patterns, acoustic ecology, and foraging ecology of cetaceans and their prey. In addition, biological and population studies of large whales will be continued in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas by deploying radio and satellite transmitters on whales, conducting photo-identification, and biopsy sampling.</p>
<p>There may be 4 additional option days used to work additional areas following the main cruise.</p>
<p>The cruise will depart from and return to Dutch Harbor, AK. Sonobuoys will be deployed round the clock during the transit to acoustically monitor for the presence of whales. Also during transit to the working area one or more onshore/offshore transects (CTD and net tows) will be conducted. Once in the working area, approximately 30 moorings containing passive acoustic recorders, active acoustic instruments, and a variety of oceanographic instrumentation will be retrieved and re-deployed at predetermined locations throughout the study area. At least six onshore/offshore transects (each consisting of approximately 10 CTD/net tow stations) will be conducted in the study area. In addition, dragging along the seafloor will be conducted in an attempt to recover moorings as necessary from previous years. Additional personnel or equipment may need to be picked up and/or dropped off in Nome, Wainwright, Kotzebue, Barrow, or any other suitable transfer location near the working grounds.</p>
<p>In addition to the 29 charter days and the 4 optional charter days, two weeks of dwell time are required in Seattle WA for installation of Government Owned equipment prior to the vessel's departure for Dutch Harbor AK. An additional 2 days in Seattle WA (preferably at the NOAA Sandpoint pier) prior to the vessel's departure for Dutch Harbor AK will be required for on-loading of Government owned equipment. At the conclusion of the charter one additional day will be required for the off loading of the Government owned equipment at either Seattle WA (preferably at the NOAA Sandpoint pier) or at Dutch Harbor AK.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis
United States Marine Corps (USMC) MH-53E Configuration and Loads Trainer

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE USMC MH-53E CONFIGURATION AND LOADS TRAINER (CLT). The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, seeks potential sources with the ability to produce training solutions that satisfy the MH-53E Configuration and Loads Trainer requirements. This advertisement serves to aid in determining market interest and capabilities for this prospective procurement. Of the available strategies, NAWCTSD is considering the viability of the following socio-economic approaches: Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) set-aside, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside, Section 8(a) suitability, and Total Small Business set-aside.
 The Contracting Officer must establish a reasonable expectation that offers would be obtained from two or more 8(a) certified, HUBZone, SDVOSB, or Small Business entities that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery. As the anticipated value of this procurement does not exceed the competitive 8(a) threshold at FAR 19.805-1(a)(2), the Contracting Officer is considering the Section 8(a) strategy from a non-competitive perspective. You are advised that the Government is seeking to define the applicability of the requirement with regard to the available socio-economic programs.

From the responses to this market research, the Government will evaluate the viable options and select the final acquisition strategy.
 Therefore, your response to this research is instrumental in supporting your companys business interests. If the Contracting Officer is unable to determine that any of the above strategies would be viable, the requirement may be competed on an unrestricted basis.

<DESC>Y--Potential Use of Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for Large Scale Construction Project 

NAVFAC Washington is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the Quantico, VA area. 

Project Description:
P-611:  The project consists of the construction of a new, 408 manspace (204 unit) Bachelors Enlisted Quarters (BEQ) and associated site improvements for Marine Helicopter Squadron 1 (HMX-1).  The site is located at on the main side of Marine Corps Base Quantico, at the Marine Corps Air Facility.  The facility shall be a multi-story, Georgian style building with a standing seam metal roof and brick veneer with stone accents.
  It shall be constructed using interior and exterior reinforced concrete masonry unit walls, reinforced concrete floors, cold formed metal roof trusses, and pile foundations.  An impermeable barrier will be placed over the foundations to prevent intrusion of groundwater and soil contaminants into the facility.  Noise reduction measures will also be integrated into the buildings construction.  The existing hanger, building 2101, shall be demolished prior to the construction of the BEQ.  The construction shall follow UFC 4-721-10 Navy and Marine Bachelor Housing, the Base Exterior Architectural Plan (BEAP), and sustainable design principals to the fullest extent possible and meeting LEED 3.0 Silver requirements.
  All anti-terrorism force protection (AT/FP) setbacks and design criteria identified in the latest edition of UFC 4-010-01 shall be met.

P-612:  The P-612 project consists of a new Enlisted Dining Facility (total 868 square meters) for the Marine Corps Air Facility (MCAF) at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Spaces within the Dining Facility consist of a dining room with men and women's public toilets; a Serving Area with three full service serving lines that are flexible in configuration to provide traditional fare, soup/salad, or quick serve foods; and the Kitchen Area with food preparation areas, freezer, refrigeration, storage space, receiving area, and can wash.  Manager's and Staff offices, locker rooms, and toilets will be provided adjacent to the kitchen area.
 A loading dock with dock leveler will be accessible from the receiving area. The Dining Facility will have core support spaces such as mechanical, electrical, and communication rooms. See the floor plans and elevations in Part 6 Attachments for required adjacencies and layout of spaces. The exterior architecture shall be Georgian in style and shall meet the requirements of the Base Exterior Architecture Plan for Quantico. Exterior walls will be brick veneer over reinforced concrete masonry units and will match existing adjacent building's Georgian Architectural Style. The roofing will be steep-slope standing seam metal roofing, and will complement the existing Georgian Style buildings at Quantico.
 Included within this project's scope of work will be the demolition of the existing dining facility, Building No. 2109.  Marine Corps Dining Facilities provide essential feeding services to uniformed military personnel.


Definition:
A Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C 158(f). 

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: 
(a)	Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.
 
(b)	An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:

(1)	Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and 
(2)	Be consistent with law. 

FAR References: 
Provision:	52.222-33	Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement 
Clause:		52.222-34	Project Labor Agreement.
 

Request responses to the following questions:

(1)	Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in the Quantico, VA area? 
(2)	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? 
(3)	Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? 
(4)	What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses? 
(5)	What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA? 
(6)	What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA? 
(7)	What other factors should be considered before deciding to include PLA provisions in a large construction contract in the Quantico, VA area? 

**	Responses shall be submitted via email to: Douglas.Riedel@navy.mil 
No later than 14:00 LOCAL TIME on 24 January 2012.

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Veterans Integrated Service Network Five (VISN 5), is seeking a contractor to develop a Safe Patient Handling Business Case.  

The Safe Patient Handling Business Case will: 1) Create a comprehensive, transparent, robust and defensible understanding of the total costs and benefits of an SPH program at the VA; 2) Identify possible alternative means, methods, or levels for implementing an SPH and create understanding of the relative advantages and disadvantages of each using a decision analysis methodology; 3) For the best implementation alternative, create new options to increase the value created by the program; 4) For the final plan with value-increasing options, create an "investment grade" business case of the costs and benefits to support the decision-making and approval processes and subsequent implementation. "Investment grade" means a business case supplying the substantiation, numerical projections, and rationale necessary for the applicable decision-making processes.

The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, and size standard is $7 million.  Responders should identify if they are a small business or small disadvantaged business concern, based on this NAICS code.

<DESC>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a Proposers' Day Workshop that will provide critical information on the program vision, the program objectives, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary proposal to respond to a Broad Agency Announcement. This solicitation is specifically for innovative multidisciplinary research proposals in the area of extended solids. The vision of the DARPA Extended Solids program is to: (i) identify high pressure material phases of molecular compounds that exhibit properties far superior to those currently available for DoD application(s), (ii) develop scalable processes that will permit access to these high pressure phases and ultimately bulk fabrication without having to go the ultrahigh pressures currently required, and (iii) develop methodologies ensure the stability of these materials down to ambient temperatures and pressures. Data obtained to date indicate that a number of these materials with extended high pressure phases exhibit superior structural (high strength, high thermal conductivity), energetic (propellant) and functional (e.g. ferroelectric, magnetic, optical) properties with the potential of concomitant performance improvements in a wide range of specific DoD applications ranging from armor to propulsion to aerospace, ground, and naval platforms. The Extended Solids Proposers' Day will introduce interested researchers to the details of the program, provide a forum to facilitate interaction, and encourage collaboration between researchers with expertise in relevant disciplines.<br /><br />SEE ATTACHED DARPA-SN-12-22.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION(NON-COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT)
(Technical/Requirements Personnel shall answer each of the following)
1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition." DOI, NPS Isle Royale National Park
The park is leasing MicroWave antenna space on the State of Michigan, MPSCS tower #9006. This 475 foot tower is located in Keweenaw County, Calumet, MI. This tower is the only tower located within range of the park that is located 50 miles from the mainland on Lake Superior that has the required height to permit the parks micro wave phone and communication system to function on the island.  The micro wave antennas must be located at 423' and 413' on the tower.  
2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved. Lease of tower space and secure room for installation of associated radio/phone equipment.
3.  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). Antenna space on 475' tower to install two micro wave dishes one at 423' and one at 413'. Micro wave dishes will provide phone and computer communication from Isle Royale to the mainland. 10' cu. Ft of secure building space is included to house communication equipment.  
4.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. Only one source exits however this represents a safety issue and we must have award.  Posted after the fact; due to urgent and compelling requirements to keep communication lines open between the mainland and the island.
5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. The State of Michigan has the only tower in the Keweenaw Peninsula that meets the height requirements to make the micro wave system functional.
6.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. FAR 5.202(a) (2) 
7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The cost of the lease is based on pre determined rates as established by the State of Michigan MPSCS. The lease will cost the NPS $11,400.00 for the first year of the five year lease. Years two - five will cost $5,700.00 annually. The NPS cannot secure land and construct and maintain a tower of this size when compared to the cost of lease. 
8.  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. State of Michigan Tower #006 is the only tower available that meets the height requirements in both Houghton and Keweenaw Counties and site located to access the island located 50 miles on Lake Superior from the antenna site.
9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.This system provides safe and secure communication between the park mainland and island.  It is detrimental to the public safety without it.
10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. 
No other sources have implied or expressed interest in this procurement due to the requirements of the tower and costs.11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 
No other tower meeting the requirements to have a functional micro wave phone system is available to lease. 12.  Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.

<CONTACT>Wendy Rizzo, Email rizzo.wendy@epa.gov
<DESC>Synopsis<br />THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to collect market information relevant to future U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements. Respondents are invited to provide input requested in this announcement including suggestions for improving the draft statements of work. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated into, a future EPA solicitation. As a result, the information submitted must be available for unrestricted public distribution. No proprietary or classified concepts or information should be included in the responses.</p>
<p>Background &amp; Scope<br />EPA's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) currently maintains two Mission Support Contracts: 1) Technology Transfer and Training Contract, and 2) Management and Analytical Support Contract.</p>
<p>The Technology Transfer and Training Contract provides support services that facilitate the Agency's national and international technology information transfer activities. These activities include issuing analytical reports covering technologies and technology-based information related to hazardous waste response or clean-up actions; design, development and delivery of technical and programmatic training; facilitation of technology demonstrations; and the delivery of other technology transfer activities (e.g., seminars, formal meetings, electronic bulletin boards, information bulletins, and the OSWER Exhibits program). <br /><br />The Management and Analytical Support Contract provides support to EPA in the planning, management, implementation, and evaluation of the Superfund program. The scope of work includes a range of technical, economic, regulatory development, and implementation tasks and deliverables. Its Statements of Work encompasses the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Strategic Planning and Government Performance and Results Act<br />&bull; Resource Management <br />&bull; Community Outreach and Environmental Justice <br />&bull; Guidance and Regional Support <br />&bull; Regulation and Legislative Analysis <br />&bull; Training <br />&bull; Facilitator and Conference Support<br />&bull; Technical Research <br />&bull; Analysis and Evaluation of Technical Data <br />&bull; Technical Coordination and Integrated Methodologies <br />&bull; Design and Construction Technical and Analytical Support</p>
<p>Responses<br />The purpose of this RFI is to determine if the tasks in the two attached Statements of Work (SOWs) may be better allocated in order to encourage more small business participation. Responses to this RFI will be used to help EPA focus and organize possible procurement activities. Responses should be succinct and address the following questions with specific information.<br /><br />EPA is considering re-competing these two requirements as multiple contracts, each with smaller scopes of work, in order to achieve maximum small business participation. EPA is open to the concept of multiple contracts for finite portions of the two current scopes of work, provided a strong technical rationale for doing so is realized. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit feedback on potentially achieving small business utilization to the maximum extent practicable, from interested parties of a small business standard that can potentially support these requirements. How would you suggest re-structuring these two scopes of work, giving close consideration to the technical demands of each task, in order to result in contracts set-aside for small businesses? How would each task's estimated annual Level of Effort also affect any re-structuring, in order for EPA to address its goal of total small business set-aside contracts? What is your rationale for your recommendations?</p>
<p>Submission Instructions to Respondents <br />Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on January 24, 2012. Please limit responses to ten (10) pages. All submissions must be electronically submitted to Wendy Rizzo, Contracting Officer, at rizzo.wendy@epa.gov as a PDF document. Inquiries to this RFI must be submitted to rizzo.wendy@epa.gov. Do not send questions with proprietary content. NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES <br />This is an RFI issued solely for information and new investment planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Respondents are advised that EPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. It is the respondents' responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received. No proprietary or classified concepts or information should be included in the submittal.</p>

<p>Interested in Introducing Your Company to the U.S Department of Labor?</p>
<p>To increase the U.S. Department of Labor's utilization of all types of small businesses, the Department's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) sponsors Small Business Vendor Outreach Sessions (VOS). These sessions offer small businesses the opportunity to market their capabilities directly to OSDBU and agency program officials and learn about potential Department procurement opportunities. Conversely, Department procurement officials can learn more about the diverse small business resources available to meet their procurement needs.</p>
<p>Department of Labor agencies buy a wide variety of goods and services valued at approximately $1.9 billion each year. Each DOL agency has a responsibility for procuring its own goods and services in support of the agency's mission. <br /><strong><br />General Procedures</strong></p>
<p>Vendor Outreach Sessions are held in the Department of Labor Great Hall on the second Wednesday of the designated month (unless otherwise noted) from 9:00 a.m. until 12 noon. Online registration will be available 30 days prior to each session. The address is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">U.S. Department of Labor <br />Frances Perkins Building (Great Hall)<br />200 Constitution Avenue, NW (between 2nd and 3rd Streets, NW) <br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sesssions begin at 9:00 a.m. and the end at 11:45 a.m. Follow-up meetings with agency representatives may be scheduled for a later date, if mutually agreed upon.</p>
<a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/osdbu/vendor_internet_info.htm#content"></a>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT<br />Solicitation Number: GS-01P-12-BW-D-0018<br />Agency: GSA, Region 1, PBS, 1PSA<br />Location: St Albans POCH<br />50 South Main Street<br />St Albans, VT 05478
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This announcement is a notice of intent to issue a sole source contract under the requirements of FAR Part 15 and FAR 6.302-1," Other Than Full and Open Competition - one responsible source". The applicable NAICS Code is 238220 with a size standard of $14.0M.</p>
<p>GSA Region 1 Acquisition Branch (1PSA) intends to issue a sole source, commercial item contract for janitorial services; mechanical operations; maintenance repairs; and, quality control services at the St Albans Post Office and Courthouse (POCH) located at St Albans, VT. This contract is being awarded under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - "Only one responsible source" as the only viable course of action that provides uninterrupted continuation of critical services.</p>
<p>This contract will be awarded as new short-term "bridge" contract with the incumbent contractor, Done Right Building Services, Inc., 4 Copley Place, Boston, MA. 02116. There will be no change to the existing specifications or service requirements and the base term of the contract will expire 09/30/2012.</p>
<p>The proposed bridge contract will be for a maximum period of 14 months (including options). This will provide for continuation of current services while the requirement is solicited and awarded on a competitive basis. Continuation of critical services requires that this contract be awarded no later than 31 Jan 2012. Due to the compressed timeframe, it is neither practical nor possible to compete this short-term contract and still provide uninterrupted services.</p>
<p>The incumbent is currently performing the work satisfactorily and has a working knowledge of the facilities, mechanical systems, and day-to-day requirements. Other contractors could not mobilize quickly enough and do not have the experience in this building needed to provide services seamlessly on such short notice and at a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, GSA will consider any capability statements received by 12 pm EDT on Wednesday, 18 January, 2012.<br />Capability statements would normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any respondent companies must be a small business. <br />Responses should be emailed to Mr. John Sarnoski, Contracting Officer, at john.sarnoski@gsa.gov so that they are received no later than 18 January 2012.</p>

<SUBJECT>D--Intent to Award Notice - GeoEye Analytics, Inc EarthWhere software support
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for annual EarthWhere software maintenance and support.
The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to GeoEye Analytics, unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes they can provide the required EarthWhere software maintenance and support.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contracting Officer, jenglehart@usgs.gov no later than 10:00 AM EST, Thursday, January 19, 2012 with an affirmative answer.   

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:
The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractor's unique qualifications:
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provides the capabilities for exploitation of classified and unclassified data in support of various federal agency programs through the Civil Applications Committee (CAC).  This support of USGS and other agency activities is coordinated through the Climate and Land Use Change (CLU) National Civil Applications Program (NCAP).  The USGS Advanced System Center (ASC) is a facility designed to support all the exploitation applications required by USGS and visiting scientists from other agencies to fulfill their missions.  Over many years, the USGS has acquired licenses to use EarthWhere software tools from GeoEye Analytics to support the geospatial data processing requirements of projects.  The existing USGS investment in this requirement is about $130,000.  GeoEye Analytics continues to enhance these tools and resolve technical problems (bug fixes).  Many of these enhancements and bug fixes are required to support changes in data formats and processes of the continually evolving Geospatial Information Systems Mapping community.  
To the best of our knowledge, there are no other companies that have access to the source code to these software tools that would allow another company to enhance the software, provide bug fixes, and provide detailed technical support for EarthWhere software tools. With regard to whether another software product could meet the NCAP requirements provided by EarthWhere software, we still find no other Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) product that could provide all the required functionality.  Required functionality includes: automate the cataloging, provisioning, and dissemination of disparate geospatial data in a web-based spatial data management system; ingesting and manipulating wide variety of vector and raster data including the classified formats used in the secure facility (ASC and RMGSC); and seamlessly interfacing with existing data bases and graphical user interfaces within the secure facilities.  The alternative to have custom software developed to provide the required functionality and accommodate the existing data would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  
Other sources were sought via internet searches, as well as email and phone communications with GeoEye Analytics, for the required support, but none were found.  Market research for other COTS products that would provide the required functionality was conducted via internet searches in 2011, yielding the results reflected above.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

POC IS MSG SANDRA BERNARD.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

POC IS MSG SANDRA BERNARD.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made based on best value trade-off evaluation of offers, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

<p>The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting quotes for 50 transgenic mice with an epidermis specific deletion in the innate immune mediator STAT3.</p>
<p>Objectives:<br />The object of the solicitation is to obtain 50 transgenic mice with an epidermis specific deletion in the innate immune mediator STAT3. The mice are required for FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative research focused on eczema vaccinatum, a poorly understood, severe complication of smallpox vaccination. The current goals are (a) to develop and characterize a novel model of eczema vaccinatum; (b) to evaluate potency of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG), the only approved therapeutic for eczema vaccinatum. <br />Background:<br />Smallpox vaccination is usually a harmless procedure, in which vaccinia virus is contained at the site of inoculation, but in a small percentage of cases the virus disseminates widely to cause severe illness. Such complications have traditionally been identified as discrete diseases with single causes, for example, progressive vaccinia (PV) in immunocompromised patients and eczema vaccinatum (EV) in persons with atopic dermatitis. However, current research indicates that the outcome of vaccination in fact reflects the interplay of a complex network of factors, including the anatomic structure and integrity of the skin; the numerous proteins that support keratinocyte barrier function; and innate and adaptive immune responses. <br />FDA's most recent studies have focused on how key elements of cutaneous defense, either alone or in combination, contribute to the failure of vaccinia virus containment in the skin and increased severity of vaccinia-associated disease. The FDA recently observed that two key innate immune proteins, STAT3 and LL-37, are both expressed at the leading edge of skin lesions in vaccinia-inoculated SCID mice, which demonstrate a clearly circumscribed primary lesion and eventual lethal progressive spread of infection after a prolonged incubation period. <br />To aid in evaluating the hypotheses, the FDA needs access to genetically defined mice which lack expression of STAT3 in the skin.<br /><br />BELOW PRICES SHALL INCLUDE ALL ANIMAL CRATING, SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS FOR ALL DELIVERIES.</p>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented through FAC 2005-55, effective 3 January 2012 and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is issued unrestricted under the NAICS 721110 with a small business size standard of $30M.  <br><br>The Virginia Army National Guard will conduct a Yellow Ribbon Post Mobilization Event March 10-11, 2012. The attached pricing schedule may be used for pricing or you may use your own pricing schedule.  However, your pricing schedule must clearly annotate pricing or the words "not separately priced" or "no cost" for each requirement identified.  Unit prices shall be inclusive of all applicable service fees.  There is not a line item on the worksheet for parking.  If parking fees are applicable, the rate for unlimited in/out 24 hour parking shall be included on your quote.  In anticipation of questions regarding if the government per diem rate is required, the following response is provided:  The solicitation is being issued on a competitive basis.  The rate utilized for purposes of award will be the rate(s) quoted by the offeror(s) determined to offer the lowest technically acceptable price(s).  However, pricing shall not exceed per diem pricing for the locality of the facility.<br><br>A performance work statement (PWS) is attached to this synopsis and is hereby made a part of this solicitation and will be made a part of any resulting award.  <br><br>The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition:  <br><br>FAR Provisions 52.212-1, 52.212-3 Alt I, and 52.252-1.  <br><br>FAR Provision 52.212-1 is amended as follows: Delete paragraphs (d) Product Samples.  <br><br>As stated in paragraph (g) of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Provision 52.212-1, included in this solicitation, "The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint." <br><br>Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the government's best interest to accept the proposed alternative. <br><br>Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the potential for multiple awards.  Since multiple awards will be considered, vendors are not required to quote all services, however, all lodging requirements must be quoted if providing lodging and all conference space and catering services shall be quoted if providing event services.  In determining the most advantageous pricing scenarios, the government will evaluate pricing as follows:  (1) Line items for lodging (attendee rooms, staff rooms and parking will be combined and line items for the event (required event space, to include audio visual and set-up requirements, catering requirements and parking) will be combined.  (2) If it is determined one vendor can meet all requirements (lodging and event) for the event and this vendor offers the overall lowest price, one award will be made to one vendor.  (3) If one vendor is not able to meet all requirements, one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for lodging and one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for the event. (4) An evaluation factor of $500.00 per award will be applied in determining if it is in the government's best interest from an administrative standpoint to make multiple awards. <br><br>To be determined technically acceptable, the following minimum requirements must be met:  <br><br>Group 1 (attendee lodging rooms, staff rooms, parking) (1) The quote must provide for all requirements within the group.  (2) The hotel facility proposed must provide guest informational service (i.e. front desk attendant, concierge service, etc.) 24 hours a day, (3) The hotel facility proposed must have on-site parking, or if off-site, valet services must be provided (4) The hotel facility proposed must be located in or between Richmond, VA and Fredericksburg, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64; from the I64/I295/I95 interchange north on I95 to Fredericksburg, VA) and (5) The hotel facility proposed must be FEMA approved.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost. For minimum requirements (2), (3), & (4) offeror must provide a fact sheet which addresses each minimum requirement.  The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided to permit a determination to be made as if minimum requirement (4) can be met.  The lodging facility FEMA number must be provided to determine if requirement (5) can be met.  If information to address minimum requirements 2-5 is available on-line, a website address can be provided in lieu of the fact sheet.  <br><br>Group 2 (event space, catering and parking) (1) The quote must provide for all services within the group, (2) The event facility proposed must have on-site parking sufficient for all attendees, and (3) The event facility proposed must be located in or between Richmond, VA and Fredericksburg, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64; from the I64/I295/I95 interchange north on I95 to Fredericksburg, VA).  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost.  For minimum requirement (2), an information sheet addressing the number of parking spaces available at the event facility must be provided.  For minimum requirement (3), the physical location of the proposed event facility must be provided.<br><br>In order for the event to be advantageous to the government, the lodging and event facilities must be located within five (5) miles of each other.  Therefore, a lodging quote only or an event quote only, in which there is no second location (event or lodging facility) quoting, will not be considered for award. As such, event and lodging facilities are encouraged to partner with each other and either one entity quote the entire requirement and enter into a subcontracting arrangement for the portion they are unable to provide or both parties ensure each entity will be quoting separately.<br> <br>FAR provisions 52.212-3, including Alt I shall be completed and returned with your offer.  If your company information is available through Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) so indicate in 52.212-3 and return only that portion of the provision.  <br><br>FAR Provision 52.252-1 and FAR Clause 52.252-2:  full text language of provisions and clauses incorporated by reference can be located at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.   <br><br>FAR Clauses 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.232-18, 52.252-2 and DFARS Clauses 252.204-7003 and 252.212-7001.  <br><br>FAR clause 52.212-4 is amended as follows: paragraph (g) (1) change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices and add after paragraph (g) (2) the following: Invoices are to be submitted via Wide Area Workflow (WAWF).

In addition, clauses, 52.222-41, 52.222-42, and 52.222-44 or 52.222-53, included in 52.212-5 may be deemed applicable pending contractor's response to FAR Provision 52.222-52 (included in FAR Provision 52.212-3 Alt I).  <br><br>The following clauses included in 252.212-7001 are applicable: 252.225-7001, 252.232-7003 and 252.247-7023 Alt III.  <br><br>All questions shall be submitted in writing and received prior to 4:00 p.m. ET, January 17, 2012.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>Description:
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-12-Q-800006 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 423850. The small business size standard is 100 employees. This solicitation is 100% set-aside for Small Business concerns. All responsible small business sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order shall be awarded as a result of this synopsis/solicitation consisting of one (1) base period and two (2) one-year option periods. The total duration of the contract shall not exceed three (3) years. This acquisition is to acquire on site calibration, filter, and sensor replacement services.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Maintenance and Calibration of Breathing Air Filtration Panels<br />for the U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909</p>
<p>1.0 Scope: The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) requires inspection, calibration and service of breathing air filtration panels for respirable air, including filter and carbon monoxide (CO) sensor change. (See Appendix A below for detailed description).</p>
<p>1.1 The required service includes actions necessary to inspect, calibrate, service, perform filter change and perform CO sensor change.</p>
<p>1.2 Calibrations performed shall be traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST.)</p>
<p>1.3 The CO monitor shall be calibrated in accordance with ANSI/NCSL Z540-1, Calibration Laboratories and Measuring and Test Equipment - General Requirements and conform to limits listed in 29 CFR 1910.134.</p>
<p>1.4 On-site inspection and calibration shall be performed on a quarterly basis, for a total of four (4) on-site visits (schedule to be provided upon award of contract).</p>
<p>1.5 A full filter and CO sensor replacement of all breathing air panels shall be performed as outlined per the manufacturer's instructions, during one of the quarterly visits (schedule to be provided upon award of contract).<br /><br />1.6 The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, and other items and services necessary to perform inspection, calibration, and service breathing air filtration panels.</p>
<p>2.0 Background: Many older compressed air systems may have air that is unfit for human use without secondary air treatment. This is due largely to the presence of objectionable oil vapors and orders. Rule and regulations governing air quality when using compressed air for respiration are quite specific. Precautions must be observed when using compressed air for breathing purposes. Oil mist from the compressor lubricating oil must not be present when the air reaches the air control device and eventually, the worker. Also, there is a possibility that oil lubricated compressors can create carbon monoxide (CO) if the compressor overheats. Studies have shown that the location of the compressor's air intake is the most likely source of CO contamination. As a result, respirable air purifying filters and CO monitors are necessary to protect the worker from potentially dangerous particles and gases.<br /><br />3.0 Work Location: Work shall be performed at the USCG ALC in Elizabeth City, NC. Specific work locations shall be as follows:</p>
<p>3.1 Hangar 87, Shop 141, Paint (8 units)<br />3.2 Hangar 77, Shop 121, Blasting (1 unit)<br />3.3 Hangar 76, Shop 121, Blasting (1 unit)<br />3.4 Hangar 75, Shop 653, Composite (4 units)</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions/clarifications.
<p>Q1. Could you please confirm whether automated online concentration is required? <br />A1. No, automated online concentration will not be used.</p>
<p>Q2. Could you please confirm whether consumables, such <br />as injection vials, caps, etc are required? We can list these as optional items.<br />A2. No, consumables will not be used.</p>
<p>Q3. Regarding Item No. 8, "Direct injection rather than loop fill injection". Could you please expand on this and define this requirement further? Does the lab intent to use a feature for loading small volumes? Or to have the GPC system automatically inject the cleaned sample directly from the GPC into the GC? The typical procedure for loading a sample is to use a loop and syringe to measure the volume. The volumes loaded onto a GPC column are usually on the order of 2-5 mL, either by full-loop or partial-loop injection. <br />A3. The Government requirement is for Direct Injection - Direct injection in this case refers to the way the GPC initially draws in sample. Direct injection is when a GPC draws up a volume of sample and then injects that entire volume onto the column. This is different from a loop injection in which the sample is drawn up and is used to fill a loop of tubing with a set volume of sample. The Loop fill injections typically draw up twice as much sample as is needed and then discard the rest.</p>
<p>2. All other terms and conditions as previously established remain unchanged.</p>

<p>B. To assure the timely and equitable evaluation of quotations, vendors must follow the instructions contained herein.

<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C of the Addendum to FAR 52.121-1 above. Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>(c) AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors, whose quotes are determined to be technically qualified, and therefore technically acceptable, will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, an award determination will be made to the lowest priced vendor that is determined to be reasonable, realistic, and affordable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services.<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days.<br />52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.<br />a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 50 months.<br />52.232-18 -- Availability of Funds.<br />Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.<br />52.252-1 -- Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference.<br />This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/<br />52.252-2 -- Clauses Incorporated by Reference.<br />This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this address: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one of the following:<br />Primary point of contact:<br />Contract Specialist: Justin Haynes<br />TEL: 01638-52-2344 or EM: justin.haynes@lakenheath.af.mil</p>
<p>Secondary Point of contact: <br />Contracting Specialist: Benjamin Shelton<br />TEL: 01638-52-2185 or EM: benjamin.shelton@lakenheath.af.mil</p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

ADDS FOS capabilities will include Data Loading and Recording (DL/DR) and a Mission Processor and Memory resource. PLEASE NOTE THAT CRASH SURVIVABLE RECORDER (CSR) IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PROCUREMENT. ADDS will be integrated with aircraft mission systems on a wide array of DoN Type, Model, and Series (T/M/S) aircraft using data structures and interfaces that are common across all Navy T/M/S aircraft. Depending upon user aircraft defined requirements, ADDS capabilities will be combined in different configurations within the ADDS FOS. Potential offerors are advised that ADDS will require National Security Agency (NSA) certified cryptography for top secret and below.</p>
<p>This procurement will now include development of capabilities for CH-53K, MH-60R/S, F/A-18E/F, and EA-18G. The following capability is required for the following platforms:</p>
<p>CH-53K, F/A-18E/F, and EA-18G: Encrypted Data Loader/Recorder</p>

<DESC>A full-scope site Level 3 probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for a nuclear power plant site can provide valuable insights into the relative importance of various risk contributors by assessing accidents involving one or more reactor cores as well as other site radiological sources (i.e., spent fuel pools and dry storage casks). These insights can be used to further enhance regulatory decision-making and to help focus limited agency resources on issues most directly related to the agency's mission to protect public health and safety.
<p>A full-scope site Level 3 PRA is a complex model that consists of many technical aspects. Each aspect of the PRA must be adequately developed so that the entire PRA may serve its intended function. Some of these technical aspects include, but are not limited to, initiating event analysis, event tree development and analysis, system reliability model (e.g., fault tree) development and analysis, human reliability analysis, data analysis, accident sequence quantification, and uncertainty analysis. A PRA is considered to be full-scope when the technical aspects are adequately developed for all major hazard groups (e.g., internal fire, internal flooding, seismic) and low power and shutdown modes of reactor operation. Additionally, a site PRA is considered to include the risk contributions from initiating events that impact more than one unit at the site; the impact of accidents at one unit on any other units at the site; and non-reactor sources of radiological material, such as spent fuel pools and dry storage casks.<br /><br />A solicitation with additional details&nbsp;is expected to be issued by January 25, 2012.</p>

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>This sources sought synopsis was publicized to find Buy American Act compliant alternatives to the Chinese-made batteries which are a component of this Simplex Fire Alarm certified as a total system under UL 864 (Fire Alarm systems). <br /><br />It has come to my attention that Simplex chose a battery which was made in China to be certified as a component of their fire alarm system and currently there is no other battery certified under UL 864. <br /><br />Through research and inquiry relating to this posting, I have found no other source to meet this UL requirement. As a result, this sources sought notice is hereby concluded with negative result. <br /><br />Simplex has been made aware of this and may elect to seek American made battery alternatives for recertification under UL 864.<br /><br />Interested vendors may wish to solicit directly with Simplex.&nbsp;

<DESC>J&amp;A citing FAR 8.405-6(b)(1) AND NOT 6.302-1 as this announcement states.&nbsp; It is for a 3 month extension of services with&nbsp;three 3-month options to ensure proper phase-in and phase-out of contractors after the protest period ends in late February 2012. The award is currently under a GAO protest and the services are still needed past the last extension end date of 1/10/2012.&nbsp; The base period of this J&amp;A will expire on 10 April 2012.&nbsp; If an option to extend another 3 months is exercised, additional posting&nbsp;will not be required as the optoins are listed in this J&amp;A.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />CLARIFICATION: This contract was originally awarded on 7/12/2010 but was extended using 52.217-8 clause for 6 months.&nbsp; The 6 month extension expired while the re-compete was still under protest and so this extension J&amp;A was needed to provide for another 3 months.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />INL has an urgent requirement to continue the basic aviation maintenance and logistics support to ARAVI. The U.S. Army CECOM contract has ended and therefore is not an option for extension of the aviation support. The incumbent CECOM prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, has a contract under the Logworld Federal Supply Schedule. INL consulted with the General Services Administration Contracting Officer under the GSA Logworld Schedule and learned that aviation maintenance and logistics support fall within the scope of the Logworld Schedule. Therefore, INL proposes a one-year task order will "bridge" the period necessary to conduct a full and open competitive acquisition for the full aviation support to include significant training for the CNP. Incidental training is within scope of Logworld, but a full scale training program is not. The GSA task order will also permit provision of phase-out services to the successor contractor.
