<DESC>MEMORANDUM FOR: ALL RENEWABLE ENERGY CONTRACTORS AND INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS
<p>FROM: Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency<br />SUBJECT: Request for Information (RFI) for Air Force Renewable Energy Programs involving proven Large Wind (greater than 500 kW) and Wind Distributed Renewable Generation Energy Technologies</p>
<p>Description<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes. The Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency is seeking cost and capability information from interested parties concerning the matters described below for application at bases across the Air Force. The Air Force has taken steps to access potential available wind resources for electricity generation at or about Air Force military installations. That data assembled from state wind resource maps and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) data. Resource Website NASA SSE data http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/sse/grid.cgi?email=State Wind Resource Maps http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_maps.asp<br />A cursory look at some Air Force wind resource studies data for 1 MW indicates that there may be opportunities for capturing large Renewable Wind energy (greater than 500 kW). These may yield attractive business developments for meeting Air Force Energy Goals. Studies of a few sites appear to be located near Nellis AFB, NV, Kirtland AFB, NM, Francis E. Warren, WY, Travis AFB, CA, Elmendorf AFB, AK, Tinker AFB, OK, and, Mountain Home AFB, CA. These are only a small representation of installations with potential renewable energy nearby.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this Wind (greater than 500 kW) RFI is twofold: first to identify market viable partnership concepts, from strategies to specific projects, to create and grow long-term public-private partnerships to develop renewable energy projects on Air Force installations in the continental United States, Hawaii and Alaska; and second, to identify qualified private sector developers, utilities, and/or like development entities with an interest in developing renewable energy projects on Air Force land. The objectives of this RFI are derived from a broad set of Air Force energy goals and operational cost savings mandates. They include, but are not limited to:<br />&#61607;Reduce Demand: The Air Force is committed to reducing installation energy demand. <br />&#61607;Increase Supply: The Air Force is committed to increasing energy supplies, utilizing renewable and alternative energy where possible, to enhance energy security and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Air Force goal is that 25% of all facility energy be from renewable sources by Fiscal Year 2025.<br />&#61607;Cost Avoidance: The Air Force is mandated to reduce or eliminate operations costs for the repair, replacement, and/or investment in energy generation infrastructure.<br />&#61607;Revenue Generation: Air Force asset management strategy seeks to optimize non-excess assets through the development of renewable energy projects, where mutually beneficial to the Air Force, external installation community, and private developers.<br />The mechanisms to implement public-private partnerships utilized by the Air Force to achieve these objectives can take many forms. Development concepts can include, but are not limited to:<br />&#61607;Renewable Energy Power Purchase Agreement (REPPA). Under the authority of 10 USC 2304 and 40 USC 113(e)(3), the Air Force purchases power from on-base renewable energy generation projects. Project size is determined by installation demand. The Air Force is the power offtaker. Solicitation is accomplished via a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>&#61607;Enhanced Use Lease (EUL). Under the authority of 10 USC &sect; 2667, the Air Force leases land to a developer, utility, or other entity to develop a renewable energy project on an installation for which the market is the power offtaker. Project size is determined by market demand and installation renewable resources, possibly augmented by surrounding community resources. Solicitation is accomplished via a Request for Qualifications (RFQ).</p>
<p>&#61607;EUL/PPA Combination. This project type is in a concept development phase at this time. An EUL/PPA maximizes the market potential of an EUL with the benefit of the Air Force being a limited offtaker of the power produced via a power purchase agreement. Each vehicle is mandated under separate authority as listed above under EUL and PPA respectively. Solicitation process to be determined.<br />&#61607;Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC). Under the authority of 10 CFR 436 Subpart B, the Air Force may enter into shared-energy savings contracts with private-sector energy service companies (ESCOs) to increase the energy efficiency at a facility. The ESCO designs and constructs a project that meets the agency's needs and arranges the necessary financing. The ESCO guarantees that the improvements will generate energy cost savings sufficient to pay for the project over the term of the contract. ESCO funded improvements are paid through a share of the savings resulting from the energy efficiency. Solicitation is accomplished via a RFP.</p>
<p>&#61607;Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESC). Under the authority of 10 USC Section 2913, the Air Force participates in utility energy efficiency programs. In a UESC, a utility arranges financing to cover the capital costs of the project, which are repaid over the contract term from cost savings generated by the energy efficiency measures. Solicitation is accomplished via a RFP.</p>
<p>&#61607;Other. The Air Force is open to any new and innovative strategies and project concepts which can help the Air Force to meet its energy goals and operational cost savings mandates. <br />Based on the Air Force's energy goals and objectives, and its unique non-excess asset portfolio in or adjacent to markets with significant renewable energy development and or potential, we believe there is a unique opportunity for market makers to partner with the Air Force to create value for all--a win-win business proposition.<br />Industry Engagement <br />This interaction with Industry organizations has been initiated following the AF Renewable Energy Industry Day held in Irving, TX on 8 December 2010. A series of RFIs to gain additional specific input will be focused on separate areas of the renewable energy spectrum. This RFI is focused on Wind (&gt;500 kW). With distributed generation, the energy produced would first be used in the host building or area. Responses on these topics may be presented in combination or in separate concepts. <br />Future RFIs, covering different focus areas, will be posted to FedBizOps.gov in approximately two week intervals to allow control of the RFI review and evaluation workload. General planning is to move through Focus Areas in the following order, subject to adjustment and change. <br />Woody Biomass<br />Large Solar (&gt;750 kW)<br />WTE with Municipal Solid Waste</p>
<p>Responses<br />Please include in your response to this Request for Information, detailed responses to the following areas:<br />a. A written summary of your ideas, inputs and development concept. Specify the technology or technologies which you specialize in with an explanation of the relationship and relevance to use of a renewable resource to provide energy benefit to the Air Force and the costs of implementing those technologies in the areas of Wind (&gt;500 kW) Generation and Distributed Generation. Please tailor your estimate of cost and benefits in comparison to commercially available industry level energy costs in the locations suggested. Your ideas and suggestions will be reviewed and evaluated for technical readiness, potential benefit, and incorporation into Air Force-wide strategy, and may be utilized to develop future RFPs, RFQs and/or initiatives towards expanded use of renewable energy. Proprietary or business confidential material should be clearly identified and will be handled appropriately by all Air Force offices.</p>

The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months. <br /><br />AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety (AAAFTS) owns the evaluation tools and the data from the formative evaluation. No other organization has coordinated the collection and analysis of the baseline data required to conduct the proposed evaluation. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation is based on the "Guidelines for Evaluation of Driver Education," which the AAAFTS produced. No other national organization has this kind of experience and expertise. Additionally, no other national organization has the influence, expertise, experience and level of acceptance that the AAFTS does within the traffic safety and driver education communities.
<p><br />No other vendors have undertaken the formative evaluation and planning to conduct a multi-site evaluation in the U.S. and Canada using the rigorous standards prescribed in the "Guidelines for Evaluation of Driver Education." As a result of this foundational research, no other vendor is qualified to conduct these tasks without substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition. AAAFTS is the only organization that can provide the skills, expertise, and experience to meet all of the program requirements including cost and time constraints.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.

<DESC>Introduction
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for a contractor to provide a suite of product development services. While the overall suite of services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of vaccine and other biologics product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway.  These services have helped a wide variety of investigators in a number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter a Phase I trial.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to study control and prevent diseases caused by all infectious agents (except HIV). Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services. (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new vaccines and biologics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a product development-oriented program to provide preclinical development support for multiple vaccine and biologic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The suite of services will encompass those activities commonly associated with the development of vaccine and biologic products for infectious disease required for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and/or Biologic License Application (BLA). Consequently, DMID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this solicitation, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:  The purpose of this solicitation is to establish a NIAID resource entitled "Manufacture and Characterization Services (MCS) for the Development of Vaccines and Other Biologics for Infectious Diseases" that provides a suite of product development preclinical services from early feasibility studies through manufacture and release of Phase I/II material. While the overall suite of services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of vaccine and biological product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway.  These services are intended to help a wide variety of investigators in a broad number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter Phase I/II trials.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:  The Contractor shall provide DMID with a broad and flexible range of development-oriented capabilities to provide preclinical development support for multiple vaccine and biologic products when such products emerge from investigator-initiated research studies or other sources identified by DMID Program staff.  These capabilities span early feasibility studies through manufacture of Phase I/II material to more rapidly and efficiently close development and production gaps, increase the government's response to emerging disease threats, and improve surge manufacturing capabilities.  The Contractor shall also provide appropriate documentation and support for pre-IND and IND submissions for Phase I and II clinical testing.</p>
<p>DMID will issue a Task Order Request for Proposal after determination of a specific need that is appropriate to the Statement of Work. The Contractor shall be prepared to develop a response in which the Contractor specifies the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key components of each Task Order and the associated costs. The needs, funding, product maturity and timelines of the product as specified in the Task Order establishes requirements for compliance with current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) [21 CFR Parts -11, -58, -210, -211, -600].</p>
<p>For the purposes of this contract, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<p>&bull;	Vaccines - An antigenic preparation used to render an organism immune to an infectious disease by inducing or increasing immunity for prophylaxis and/or therapy. Vaccine product include but are not limited to synthetic peptides, recombinant proteins, nucleic acids, viral-like particles, vector-based vaccines, as well as live, modified, and/or attenuated organisms.</p>
<p>&bull;	Vaccine Components - An antigen-enhancing substance (i.e. adjuvant) or a delivery system (i.e. needle free dermal patch) that is used during dose administration to enhance the immune response of a vaccine.</p>
<p>&bull;	Other Biologics - Therapeutic preparations made from living organisms or the components of living organisms and are most likely regulated by CBER.  Biologics include but are not limited to allergenics; antitoxins; blood and blood products; and cellular and gene therapy products.  For the purposes of this contract, challenge material for non-clinical, preclinical, and clinical trials will also be added to the definition of biologics.</p>
<p>The services shall be directed at the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	diseases caused by pathogens and toxins on the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens list  (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/Pages/CatA.aspx)<br />&bull;	emerging and re emerging infectious diseases;<br />&bull;	antimicrobial resistant and multi drug resistant infections;<br />&bull;	other bacterial infections;  <br />&bull;	fungal infections; <br />&bull;	viral infections; and<br />&bull;	parasitic diseases.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for a contractor to provide a suite of preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing services for vaccines and other biologic products. While the overall suite of testing services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of vaccine and biological product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway. These services are intended to help a wide variety of investigators in a broad number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I/II/III trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter Phase I/II/III trials.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research for the investigation, control and prevention of diseases caused by all infectious agents other than HIV. Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new vaccines and biologics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a coordinated evaluation and testing services program to provide preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing support for multiple vaccine and biologic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The suite of testing services will encompass those activities commonly associated with the testing of vaccine and biologic products for infectious disease required for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and/or Biologic License Application (BLA). Consequently, DMID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this solicitation, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this solicitation is to establish a NIAID resource entitled "Evaluation and Testing Services (ETS) for Vaccines and Other Biologics for Infectious Diseases" that provides a suite of preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical testing services for vaccines and other biologic products. While the overall suite of testing services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of vaccine and biological product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway. These services are intended to help a wide variety of investigators in a broad number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I/II/III trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter Phase I/II/III trials.<br /><br />Project Requirements: The Contractor shall provide DMID with a broad and flexible range of proactive and developmentally-oriented capabilities to provide testing services to support preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical studies for promising products when such products emerge from investigator-initiated research studies or other sources identified by DMID Program staff. These testing capabilities support early feasibility through Phase III clinical studies to 1) provide the ability to combine, develop, test, evaluate and refine different evaluation and testing technologies from multiple developers; 2) create capacity for the evaluation and testing of candidate vaccines and other biologics for infectious diseases and/or related toxins; 3) increase the Federal Government's response to emerging disease threats; and 4) improve surge capabilities. The Contractor shall also provide appropriate documentation and support for pre-IND, IND, and BLA submissions.</p>
<p>DMID will issue a Task Order Request for Proposal after determination of a specific need that is appropriate to the Statement of Work. The Contractor shall be prepared to develop a response in which the Contractor specifies the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key components of each Task Order and the associated costs. The needs, funding, product maturity and timelines of the product as specified in the Task Order establishes requirements for compliance with current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) [21 CFR Parts -11, -58, -210, -211, -600].</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Emory University-Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood Road, Atlanta, GA  30329 for the project entitled, Search for the Auditory Engram in Chimpanzees.  

This project involves training chimpanzees to perform an auditory delayed matching-to-sample-task to test long-term memory.  The chimpanzees at Yerkes have had extensive behavioral training on matching-to-sample type cognitive tasks.  In particular, they have training on matching vocalizations with appropriate facial expressions.  Because of this, memory will be assessed to determine if there is any long-term memory in this type of task.  Thus, the chimps will have to remember the vocalization for several seconds before they can match to the appropriate face.  Once testing is complete for this task, the chimps will then be tested directly on an auditory recognition memory task.  Testing will be done in the Yerkes Cognition Room, using a touchscreen set-up.  For the Auditory match-to-sample training, a trial begins with a sound (2s) from a single speaker.  Touching the touchscreen during the sound will not be rewarded, but will, instead, immediately trigger a second sound (2s) presented through the same speaker.  If the sound matches the sample sound touching the left spot on the touch screen during the second sound will result in a reward.  If the sound does not match the sample sound then touching the spot on the right of the touch screen results in reward.  The chimps will be tested on 100 trials a day.  The sounds will be from a set of 900 junk sounds that includes natural sounds to synthetic sounds.  The chimps will be trained on this or a modified version until they perform above 85% correct.  To test the chimps auditory memory, a very short delay will be introduced at first between the sample and test sounds.  Then the delay will be gradually increased until the chimp no longer performs significantly above chance.  

In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the work is to be conducted at Yerkes National Primate Research Center, where access to test chimpanzees is available.  The proposed work is a continuation of the collaboration between Yerkes and NIMH.  The Yerkes primate center has an expert in chimpanzee cognitive behavior and has an interest in memory processes.  The team of investigators has the expertise and experience to complete the proposed work, thus it is cost efficient to continue the ongoing collaboration. 

The period of performance is 12 months with two 12-month option periods.  

The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 12-Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and FAR 13.501(a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Commercial Items.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 10:00 AM E.T., June 3, 2011 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIMH to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, the vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at ww.ccr.gov.  Please reference announcement number NOI-2121472 on all correspondence.

Background and Scope
This project will design and replace more than 8 miles of seriously deteriorated, underground electrical cable on historic Floyd Bennett Field.  Most of the cables date from the 1930s when the field was in use as the first airport for the City of New York.  Lines affected by this work consist of #4/0 and #2/0 three-conductor cables with paper insulated lead covering.  All new cables will be installed using polyethylene insulated and protected with PVC shields.  These cables provide primary electrical service to 95% of the buildings on Floyd Bennett Field which includes the Jamaica Bay unit headquarters and maintenance shop, historic hangar row, and USPP New York Field Office.  Tenants or park partners directly affected by the cables include NYC Police, NYC Department of Sanitation, and Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment.  Frequent power outages and serious safety concerns with the potential of fire and danger to employees are a daily occurrence.    
The Medium Voltage Distribution System at Floyd Bennett Field was installed in the 1930's and 1940's.  Since that time there have been no major cable replacements or upgrades to the distribution system.  Recently a large portion of the 5kV switches and disconnects have been replaced.  The current project encompasses the replacement of a large portion of the Medium Voltage (5kV) Distribution System Cabling at Floyd Bennett Field.  The work will include but not be limited to, the installation of approximately 10,000 feet of new concrete encased duct bank, new manholes, work within existing manholes, installation of approximately 200,000 feet of cable, and connection to existing buildings and equipment.  The new duct banks will be installed in new locations or adjacent to the existing duct banks.  All existing cabling and duct banks shall be abandoned in place.
Type of Procurement:  An 8(a) competitive set-aside, negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a business/price proposal.  A best value, trade-off process will be used for selection of the successful offer considering technical, past performance and price evaluation factors.
All 8(a) certified firms located in Region II may submit an offer that will be considered.  Region II consists of the states of New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands.
A pre-proposal conference will be held at Building 69 of Floyd Bennett Field at Gateway National Recreation Area, Brooklyn, New York. Tenative Time and Date for the pre-proposal conference is 9:00 AM Eastern time, Wednesday June 22, 2011.
All questions should be submitted in writing to both Raymond_Prazak@nps.gov and to Scott_Rydwell@nps.gov.

Questions from potential offerors will be accepted after formal solicitation release, which is expected in Summer 2011. **  

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a competitive solicitation for Aegis Combat System Engineering Agent (CSEA) design, development, and integration efforts, including Advanced Capability Build (ACB) development, in support of the Program Executive Officer for Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) and the Major Program Manager (MPM) for Integrated Combat Systems (PEO IWS 1.0).
  Requirements include design, development, and integration of the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) and Aegis Combat System (ACS) future capabilities for the CG 47 and DDG 51 ship classes, and other future ships with a combat system that is an evolution of the Aegis Combat System.  PEO IWS plans to evolve AWS/ACS through periodic Advanced Capability Builds (ACB), which will deliver new capability to ships, and through periodic Technology Insertions (TI), which will modernize the ships computing plants and provide a foundation upon which the combat system can function.  The systems engineering, development, and integration work under this contract will execute future ACBs/TIs through the period of performance of the contract.
  The successful offeror shall provide engineering services associated with the integration of new combat systems configurations and interfaces including systems engineering, software development, and upgrades in support of the Aegis class ships.  

A summary of the anticipated requirements by contract line item and contract-type is hereby provided for information/planning purposes.  The solicitation will provide all detailed Statement of Work (SOW) and deliverable requirements of each.  

- ACB 16: Cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) completion form (see FAR 16.306(d)(1)) with specified performance incentives; 

- Technology Insertion (TI) 16: CPFF term form with a specified level of effort (see FAR 16.306(d)(2) and (4)) and specified performance incentives; 

- Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) Integration Engineering Load: CPFF completion form with specified performance incentives; 

- ACB 20: CPFF term form with a specified level of effort and specified performance incentives; 

- TI 20: CPFF term form with a specified level of effort and specified performance incentives; 

- In-Service Baseline Maintenance, Special Studies, and Miscellaneous Support: CPFF term form with a specified level of effort; 

- Other Direct Costs (e.g., travel): Cost-only (see FAR 16.302); and 

- Enhanced Data Rights: Firm-fixed price (see FAR 16.202-1) option.
 

NAVSEA intends to award one (1) cost-type contract, as described above, via full and open competition.  Potential offerors should note that this contract structure differs from the previous structure of the draft solicitation N0002410R5120, originally released on 29 April 2010.  The revised structure reflected above includes CPFF completion form line items, where practicable, for which offerors will be required to price and baseline defined tasks for completion.  The structure of draft solicitation N0002410R5120 included only CPFF term form line items with a specified level of effort (i.e., man-hours) and sample Technical Instructions that would be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating technical capability and price.
  As noted above, FAR 16.306(d) describes these two basic forms of CPFF contracts in further detail.  

This pre-solicitation notice is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  

Disclaimer: This pre-solicitation notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts.
  The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis.  If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FBO/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice.  This is not an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP and this information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.  

Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided or mailed.  Interested offerors should monitor the identified websites for the release of the solicitation.  Since this solicitation, and any applicable amendments, will be issued electronically, the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidders mailing list.
 

IMPORTANT: In order to be considered for contract award, each offeror must have a TOP SECRET facility clearance and must be a United States (US) company or an independent US subsidiary.  However, foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. prime contractors.  The export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and requires the issuance of an export license by the U.S. Department of State.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research is interested in receiving white papers and full proposals for both Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development that will forge major advancements towards a user oriented "World View" with varying degrees of fidelity for situational awareness and understanding for both Tactical and Strategic views. To achieve this vision, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) products need to be synchronized with Command and Control (C2) for seamless mission prosecution. The program goals are to: 1) provide timely unified information support to the agile tactical user, and 2) develop autonomous mission focused sensing systems.
<p>United States (US) Forces are being placed in environments where they are required to function with increased autonomy. The need is stronger than ever to be able to autonomously maintain persistent surveillance of activities and entities over a region of interest on a continuing (24 hrs / 7 days a week) basis, as well as automated tasking of these assets upon mission priority (e.g., Troops in Contact (TIC) versus Nation Building activities). In order to achieve this, an underlying context for real-time adaptive surveillance in support of tactical mission objectives is essential. The use of open architectures and compliance with industry standards is important for facilitating system integration and efficient sharing of information in an enterprise.</p>
<p>US Forces currently request and are allocated ISR assets during the mission planning process (e.g., Rapid Response Planning Process (R2P2)). However, quite often the low density of ISR assets necessitates the sharing of assets between units. This is especially true in the distributed environment related to Counter Insurgency (COIN) Marines operate in today. This means operations proceed without certainty that there will be sufficient ISR coverage. Operational staffs (especially Battalion level and below) are forced to work with limited situational awareness while providing support to units in the field (e.g., convoys, mobile and foot mobile patrols) . This limits the overall ability of the unit to provide Command and Control (C2) because of the limited situational awareness. Automated mission focused autonomy for unmanned vehicles (UxVs) and subsequent real-time tasking of these assets by units in the field does not exist, but is necessary to reduce the manning required to operate sensors and make sensor placement decisions that can provide our Forces needed coverage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the enormous volume of data produced by ISR assets necessitates the automation of data processing for transport (e.g., data compression, data orchestration for mediation) and to assist the warfighter in the conversion of the data into automation (e.g., searching high value target databases with information from image recognition algorithms run over the ISR feeds, algorithms that support data fusion across warfighting functions). Changing relevance of rural/urban data means that the data provided must have space-time and geo-cultural context to provide essential information to mobile users. Commanders need an Information Technology (IT) architecture that supports information sharing to efficiently utilize all resources across their domains including platforms, personnel, sensors, and networks to prosecute multiple missions.</p>
<p>Current capability limitations include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to organize knowledge at both the tactical and strategic levels by unified information ontologies or data mappings.<br />&bull; Ability to assess large quantities of imagery and full motion video information and determine potential threat activities using algorithms that work with limited IT assets (i.e., storage and processing).<br />&bull; Ability to express the information needs of tactical missions and provide users relevant information through the enterprise. <br />&bull; Ability to project the value of information versus location given mission plans and area events over time.<br />&bull; Ability to align tactical and strategic analysis capabilities and sensor resources to current and future information requirements.</p>
<p>The BAA seeks to develop an ability to measure the value of information across an area as a function of time given knowledge of current and future missions and to measure the amount of known relevant information spatially organized as a function of time.</p>
<p>In addition to the limitations described above, a number of shortfalls exist which are to be addressed in this BAA. These shortfalls are briefly described below.</p>
<p>Mission Planning and Direction<br />The planning and direction of tactical and theater sensors are conducted within stovepipes. These stovepipes contain little tactical mission awareness. Manpower intensive sensor control limits the scope of sensor support. There is a lack of sharing knowledge of unfolding events across mission threads.</p>
<p>Data Processing and Exploitation<br />Analysis is manpower constrained on partial data sets. The Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB) is a slow, manual, and inaccessible to the enterprise process. There is a lack of timely exploitation of useful theater and national sensor data. There are gaps in alerting Forces to danger.</p>
<p>Mobile Sensing and Production<br />Tactical users do not fully benefit from enterprise knowledge or effectively feedback observations to the operational view. There is a lack of mobile tools for field users to gather information. There is a lack of means for reporting soft biometric data on at-risk individuals or groups engaged in suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Dissemination and Utilization<br />Many sensors fail to deliver relevant information to users outside their stovepipes. The enterprise lacks flexibility to morph dynamically with changing tactical mission requirements. Wide area sensors support is available at command levels but is needed at unit level to counter irregular actors. Sensor data overwhelms the distribution, analysis, storage, and assimilation capabilities.</p>
<p>The three (3) Thrust Areas are described in further detail in the following sections.</p>
<p>Thrust Area 1 - Mobile Autonomous ISR to C2 Synchronization</p>
<p>The objective of this thrust is to extend the current baseline of the MAGTF C2 Software Architecture and its implementation (i.e., Tactical Service Oriented Architecture (TSOA)) to establish the necessary standards and patterns as well as provide a reference implementation for ISR and C2 that allows sensor and data analysis nodes to anticipate the information needs of the tactical warfighter. The approach should use open standards where possible (with reason provided why open standards did not suffice) as well as comply with Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA) principles and functions as diagramed below. A key challenge is the delivery of relevant information to mobile users (foot mobile and vehicle borne). This could be addressed through a cloudlet computing or other computing paradigm. The architecture should enable generation of simultaneous situational awareness for both the Marine Squad (foot mobile or vehicular borne on land or at sea) as well as their command and control agency (e.g., Combat Operations Center, Company Level Operations Center) with relevant data and alerts of potential danger.</p>
<p>Thrust Area 2 - Autonomous Information-Based Surveillance Control</p>
<p>The objective of this thrust area is to develop an autonomous sensing system that utilizes coverage history, data and context from available sources, along with, mission plan and routes to provide persistent surveillance over a large region of interest, typically 40 nmi by 40 nmi with multiple UxVs. This tactical information is to be provided from a group of UxVs operating in an autonomous mode.</p>
<p>Thrust Area 3 - Contextual Enterprise Information</p>
<p>The objective of this thrust area is to develop and exploit enterprise tools to:</p>
<p>i.) Assess coverage of tactical sensors to identify gaps in coverage, <br />ii.) Recognize contextual information needed to support tactical activities, and <br />iii.) Satisfy the need for additional coverage or context, where feasible, through access to naval or other Service or Agency assets or archived information sources.</p>
<p>Proposals should specify thrust area addressed, either Thrust Area 1, Thrust Area 2, or Thrust Area 3. A well written proposal will describe the technologies that will be developed. Rationale should be provided as to why the approach chosen offers promise to the warfighter. These can be focused to any particular level of command. Within the proposal, clearly state who the potential users will be that would benefit from this capability. To ensure that technology developments are compatible with DoD and information technology standards, proposals should also identify the format standards, protocol standards, display standards, etc. that will be used.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 19 Rocky Mountain Network Contracting Center 4100 East Mississippi Avenue, Suite 900, Glendale, CO 80246 issues this notice of intent to award a contract on a sole source basis on behalf of the George E. Whalen VA Medical Center Salt Lake Research and Development Office, Health Services Research and Development Office, Consortium for Healthcare Informatics Research (CHIR) Program with the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Melon University to produce active and proactive machine learning methods. This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Research Service of the Salt Lake City Healthcare System requires specialized services in machine learning for medical informatics research.  In the vast majority of inductive learning problems, including centrally induced patterns in clinical data, where there is a paucity of high-quality expert-labeled data.  Diagnosis of PTSD requires the careful consideration of a number of factors, including details related to service, symptoms, demographics, and mental condition. These factors are recorded across a number of document types and in a variety of formats including structured, semi-structured and unstructured values. The unique qualifications of the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) is based on its expertise in conducting research and providing graduate education in all aspects of language technologies, including computational linguistics, machine translation, speech recognition and synthesis, statistical language modeling, information retrieval and web search engines, text mining, information management, digital libraries, intelligent tutoring, and more recently bio-sequence/biolanguage, structure and function analysis (genome, proteome). The LTI combines linguistics approaches with machine learning and corpus-based methods, depending on the scientific questions investigated and project needs.  The Language Technologies Institute (LTI) has expert experience in providing reports in the investigation of Active and Proactive Machine Learning Methods. The LTI has expertise in providing national reports on the methods of Active learning to address the issue of selecting the most informative instances to give to the expert to label, based on criteria such as: 1) maximal uncertainty of the learning method based on prior training data (ask where you know the least), 2) maximal density unsampled regions in instance space (ask for the most representative new cases), 3) maximal diversity in instance space (ask where no one asked before).  The Language Technologies Institute has the expertise on the next steps beyond active learning which is proactive learning, where the contractor has consulted on the aspects of expert performance to determine the cost of expert labeling, the estimated accuracy of expert labeling, and which of multiple external experts should be queried. For instance, some instances may be easier (less-costly) to label by any expert than other more complex instances. In other cases, one expert can be more accurate or more available or less costly than another or there may be tradeoffs.  The Language Technologies Institute (LTI) has developed programs utilizing heterogeneous features to improve clinical classification and outcome predictions.  The Language Technologies Institute (LTI) has tested the performance of various automated approaches required as an iterative consideration of the contributions of feature sets.  The Language Technologies Institute (LTI) has the research experience where they have completed a number of experiments which will be conducted to measure the performance of combinations of features including structured values (e.g., demographics, labs) as well as NLP-derived concepts indexed from free text.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE RESPONSES. However, all responses received within five days after publication of this notice may be considered by the government. Responses can be faxed to Pamela Barnes at 303-691-6558 or sent via mail to VISN 19 Rocky Mountain Network Contracting Center, 4100 East Mississippi Avenue, Suite 900, Glendale, CO 80246. A determination not to compete the acquisition based upon the responses received is solely at the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of all responsible sources, including large, non-profit, and small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code, 541512, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge in the area of implementation of annual Continuing Education (CE) requirements for all return preparers who are not attorneys, enrolled agents, enrolled actuaries, or enrolled retirement plan agents. The IRS intends to award a no-cost contract; the vendor(s) will not be reimbursed by the federal government for fees, costs, or any other charge or expense.  The vendor is expected to cover its cost and any profit by charging reasonable provider fees.  

I. BACKGROUND
In June of 2009, the IRS Commissioner launched a comprehensive review of return preparers in an effort to help the IRS better leverage this community with the twin goals of increasing taxpayer compliance and ensuring uniform and high ethical standards of conduct for preparers.  The IRS Strategic Plan for 2009  2013 addresses the importance of return preparers in two objectives: 

1)	Strengthen partnerships with tax practitioners, tax return preparers, and other third parties in order to ensure effective tax administration , and

2)	Ensure that all practitioners, tax return preparers, and other third parties in the tax system adhere to professional standards and follow the law.

In December 2009, the IRS announced the results of the review and made multiple recommendations to increase the oversight of return preparers.  Please refer to the IRS Return Preparer Report (dated December 2009) for a greater understanding of the context and detail of the IRS Return Preparer recommendations: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4832.pdf.  

Included in the recommendations was the implementation of annual Continuing Education requirements (hereafter, referred to as CE) for all return preparers who are not attorneys, CPAs, enrolled agents, enrolled actuaries, or enrolled retirement plan agents.  

The Return Preparer program plans to begin reviewing and approving applications from continuing education providers no later than September 2011.  Although individual courses will not be reviewed and approved, providers will be required to verify their qualifications as an educational provider.  In addition, the IRS is considering requiring some applicants to provide a sample course for review.  In order to manage this process effectively, the Return Preparer Office will need a system that includes the following:  

Enables providers to submit requested information and upload documentation of proof when necessary [i.e. contact information, credentials or other status (e.g. academic institution)] upon registration and renewal. If approved by the IRS, generates appropriate outcome letter and provider identification number on behalf of the IRS;
Issues numbers (or range of numbers) for courses offered by each provider;
Accepts upload of records from providers, by PTIN, for all courses completed by a given PTIN holder;
Uploads these records via interface to the PTIN database that is housed and maintained by a vendor;
Accessible by IRS or, as needed, TIGTA and contractors for purposes of provider approvals, review, audit, analysis, and reporting;
Generates automated notices to a secure mailbox for providers who must renew their approvals;
Provides applicable information about approved CE providers to the IRS to display in a public format in order for tax preparers to determine approved IRS providers (i.e. web page and/or links to provider web pages);
Ability to add other CE provider types in later phases (Enrolled Agents, Enrolled Retirement Plan Agents, and Enrolled Actuaries);
Has a call center structure to handle questions from CE providers;
Meets IRS security and privacy requirements

Explain which of these tasks you can perform and, to the extent possible based on the description above, provide an estimate or range of what you might charge per applicant for this service.

Any responsible sources that currently possess such capabilities and have prior experience providing services using this expertise are encouraged to respond to this notice by providing the following information:

1. Narrative providing evidence of expertise in the above areas. The narrative should include: (1) description of services that align with the areas noted above; and (2) descriptions of similar projects worked on by your company as a prime contractor or as a significant subcontractor within the past five (5) years, including: (a) dollar amount of the contract; (b) detailed description of the technical AND schedule requirements of that project; (c) a copy of sample reports completed under that project (if releasable to IRS); (d) contract type used on that project; (e) indication of how long the project took/will take to complete from start to finish, and (f) name, address, point of contact, phone number and email address at customer organization for which the work was/is being done

2. Current socioeconomic status of your company including the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code.

3. Indication of whether your company currently has an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://bpn.orca.gov

No telephone requests will be honored. All information provided will become property of IRS and will not be returned.

The synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. All information submitted in response to this announcement must arrive on or before the closing date June 06, 2011; 4:00pm est.

<SUBJECT>Request For Information on Launch Services for ORS Enabler Missions
<SOLNBR>ORS-RFI-11-001
<RESPDATE>062711
<CONTACT>Frank J. Strub, Director of Contracts, Phone 505-853-2838, Fax 505-846-6302, Email frank.strub2@kirtland.af.mil - Steve Buckley, Chief Engineer, Launch and Range, Phone 505-853-7799, Fax 505-846-6302, Email steven.buckley@kirtland.af.mil
<DESC>The Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office, Kirtland AFB New Mexico is interested in receiving information relating to a potential launch service contract. The objective of this Request For Information (RFI) is to a) survey the launch vehicle service providers on the availability of launch systems to meet the mission requirements and b) determine additional investment not already identified and required by the ORS Office to meet 1) reduced call up timelines, 2) overall cost reduction efforts and 3) upgrades to handling/transportation equipment required to meet quick reaction timelines (defined later in the RFI). Expected payloads for this class launch system will not exceed 460kg to a 450-550kms circular orbit at a 42-50 degree inclination. The initial payload will consist of multiple free flying satellites accommodated on Government furnished multi payload adapters (detailed later in the RFI). These launches will also be used to demonstrate technologies that the ORS Office has identified as "enablers" to meet ORS Office objectives of 6 day call ups. The hardware for these demonstrations may be either Government furnished or if a launch vendor has alternative solutions that meet the objectives those may be used. It should be noted that part of the ORS Office objective is to execute missions that are constrained by cost goals set forth by Congress. Therefore, efficiencies across the enterprise must be made. As part of the Enabler Mission, the ORS Office will apply the enablers that have already been identified and have been addressed as well as identifying new areas of focus to prioritize how and when to address them. Finally, the prominent objective is to execute a launch within 6 days of a call up. This RFI will identify several key areas of concern that demonstrate a vendors ability to; 1) a demonstrated history of successful space launch missions, 2) mature launch vehicle designs and systems, 3) ability to successfully integrate enabling technologies in a parallel demonstration/validation mode, and 4) ability to knowledgeably address hurdles within current processes associated with gaining clearance to launch.
<p>This section of the RFI will provide top level discussion on terms used by the ORS Office in developing the mission requirements. They are meant to provide enough detail that vendors are able to respond to the RFI with more detailed information being provided within an RFP should the ORS Office decide to release one.<br /><strong>&bull; 6-Day Call-up: <br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Definition - A simulated National need for an ORS asset capability is made from USSTRATCOM to the ORS Office. The ORS Office must then deliver capability to the Warfighter 7 days later. <br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o</strong> Assumption - Space vehicle capability is not achieved for 24 hours after separation from the launch vehicle. Therefore, from the call up to the launch is 6 days or 144 hours. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Assumption - The Space vehicle (or Payload in its entirety known as the Integrated Payload Stack (IPS)) will not be an unknown and during the integration portion of the mission, a process of communicating requirements through interface control documents and other controlled media will be used.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Assumption - The IPS, launch vehicle and range will work to a state of readiness to support 6 day call up operations. This means that each will define an appropriate level of pre-positioning of assets. The ORS Office will serve as the program integrator and ensure that the CONOPs is coordinated and executable across the various organizations and companies involved.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Assumption - Wallops Flight Facility is the preferred launch site. ORS Office has focused CONOPs and funded enabler efforts with NASA as a Government partner. <br /><strong>&bull; Payload<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Definition - The payload, when referenced in this and other launch documents refers to the mass above the launch vehicle interface (as defined by the LV vendor) that is to be lifted by the launch vehicle. It includes but is not limited to the satellites, adapters, separation system, and SoftRide. It would also include any enabler technologies such as autonomous flight safety systems that are flown in demonstration/validation mode and whose mass and volume must be accounted for as total mass of payload to orbit.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong>&nbsp;Assumption - Any enabler technologies or adapter hardware provided as GFE by the ORS Office or other Government partner will have been designed and tested to meet all applicable flight environments.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Assumption - Integrated Payload Stack will be integrated as essentially a single space vehicle as far as SV to LV integration is concerned. The LV contractor will only be required to integrate to a single interface plane. Additionally, while there may be many satellites, the LV will only have to provide 2 separation signals, one to primary free flyer and the second to a sequencer on the multiple satellite adapter that will subsequently deploy the remaining free flying satellites. The adapter hardware will not separate from the upper stage of the launch vehicle.<br /><strong>&bull; Commercial Launch<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Definition - ORS defines commercial launch services as those procured using FAR Part 12 with licensing for launch obtained by the LV vendor through the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Assumption - A LV vendor can request GFE items. As stated, the ORS Office has made investments in enabling technologies and encourages vendors to leverage those efforts. In addition, vendors are encouraged to identify Government items that will reduce the overall cost of the mission. The ORS Office will be responsible for entering into any agreements or other arrangements required with other organizations for the use of the GFE. Vendors shall identify if the GFE is consumable or non-consumable.<br /><strong>&bull; Demonstration<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Definition - An aspect of the mission, whether it be a process or piece of hardware, that is executed as a secondary aspect of the mission. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Assumption - Should a new process for stacking be proposed, the primary method will be kept as a backup in the event the demonstration proves to induce greater risk, cost or schedule impacts. Additionally, a system such as autonomous flight safety would fly in a mode that only demonstrates capability per a test plan in an effort to receive certification of the unit and not as the primary source for flight safety.<br /><strong>&bull; Initial Launch Capability<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o </strong>Definition - The point in time at which an execution of the 6-day call-up is possible. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Assumption - Assets are pre-positioned in a state of readiness that has been defined by the vendor and accepted by the ORS Office.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Assumption - Only missions within the pre-determined boundaries are potential.</p>
<p>The Integrated Payload Stack is conceptually designed to be accommodated on a number of small launch systems based on User Guide information obtained from open sources. Current mass estimate of the IPS is 454kg &plusmn; 15kg. There will be two CubeSat wafers that have a static diameter of 46" with one wafer attaching to a standard 38.81" interface. The combined height of the two wafers will be approximately 20" above the LV interface. A primary satellite that meets ESPA standards (details can be obtained from a web search) will interface to the top wafer via a Motorized Light Band (MLB).</p>
<p>As part of the ORS 6-day call-up demonstration, the exact orbit will not be provided to either the range or launch vehicle contractor prior to launch. However there will be some defined boundaries. The inclination will be from 42 to 50 degrees. The orbit will be circular with an altitude between 450 and 550kms. The objective of this is to demonstrate the ability to rapidly execute the generation of launch vehicle flight code as well as range safety approval of trajectory using enabling technologies that either the ORS Office or a LV vendor has invested in.</p>
<p>The ORS Office requests that vendors provide a proposed concept on their ability to execute to the mission description remaining consistent with the definitions and assumptions provided above. Responses can be in the form of either a paper or brief. Papers are limited to 25 pages using a font of reasonable size between 10 and 14 point. Briefs are limited to 50 slides and either Powerpoint or PDF are acceptable formats.</p>
<p>Responses should include a brief description of the LV capability to the considered orbits (it is not a requirement that the LV meet performance to every possible orbit within the provided boundaries, however max performance to each will be used in ORS trade studies to determine mission risk, future payload designs based on capability, and other architecture trades).</p>
<p>A brief description of processes, hardware and handling equipment changes needed to a baseline LV configuration should be addressed. Further, we request that any GFE/P items that are known be defined so ORS Office has time to work agreements with other organizations to acquire and provide those items should an RFP be released.</p>
<p>The ORS Office anticipates using Commercial Practices as defined in FAR Part 12 (Commercial Items) as the procurement strategy; the ORS Office will still require a level of insight into the program that provides enough information for the office to accurately assess mission risk and readiness to execute. Provide your recommended review process, level of detail and milestone(s) that allow the ORS Office to make decisions such as shipping the IPS to the launch site at Wallops. Also provide the services that the IPS can expect during the integration process; examples may include management of range documentation and requirements, Coupled Loads Analysis, management of the LV to SV Interface Control Document, etc.</p>
<p>Define any terminology that would not be considered standard and provide assumptions used in your concept not provided in this RFI as appropriate.</p>
<p>As part of your response to this RFI, provide a Rough Order of Magnitude estimate for the execution of this mission. The estimate should include a total mission execution timeline from award of contract to an Initial Launch Capability, the ORS Office goal is to launch within 18 to 24 months of contract award; however 12 to 15 months is preferred. In the cost of the mission, it is assumed that the LV vendor will be responsible for interfacing with and procuring the range and their services.</p>
<p>Sources responding to this Request for Information (RFI) should identify any information which will enable the Government to determine industries' interest in supporting this possible mission. RFI responses will contribute to the Market Research Report as part of the acquisition strategy development process. Currently, an acquisition strategy has not been determined.

<DESC>The Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office, Kirtland AFB New Mexico is interested in receiving information relating to the technical feasibility,&nbsp;ROM costs, schedules and current state-of-the-art of a future Autonomous Flight Safety System (AFSS) development effort. Feedback is very important relative to identification of assumptions, compliance concerns/questions and development/production risks. ORS Office has the mission responsibility for development, test and evaluation, and acquisition of a vast array of launch, range and other related systems and subsystems. This is a key launch enabler for the ORS office in the requirement to execute 6-day call-up launch campaigns as well as the cost constraints and goals that have been imparted on the office. The ORS office is also interested in understanding ways in which the system can be used across a wide range of launch systems and launch locations. The ORS Office has drafted a Statement of Work (SOW) and Specification for Autonomous Flight Safety Systems (AFSS) that can be provided upon request that will provide information concerning the general scope of the program as well as technical requirements based on guiding range safety documentation. These documents are export controlled and will only be provided to companies that have a Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement in place with DLIS. Responses can be submitted in either a Word document narrative limited to 25 single spaced pages or as a Powerpoint of PDF briefing of no more than 50 slides. <br />
<p><br />Sources responding to this Request for Information (RFI) should identify any information which will enable the Government to determine industries' interest in supporting the AFSS requirements. RFI responses will contribute to the Market Research Report as part of the acquisition strategy development process. Currently, the acquisition strategy has not been determined.

<SUBJECT>Request For Information on Launch Services for Nano-Satellites
<SOLNBR>ORS-RFI-11-003
<RESPDATE>062711
<CONTACT>Frank J. Strub, Director of Contracts, Phone 505-853-2838, Fax 505-846-6302, Email frank.strub2@kirtland.af.mil - Steve Buckley, Chief Engineer, Launch and Range, Phone 505-853-7799, Fax 505-846-6302, Email steven.buckley@kirtland.af.mil
<DESC>The Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office, Kirtland AFB New Mexico is interested in receiving information relating to a potential launch service contract. The objective of this Request For Information (RFI) is to a) survey the launch vehicle service providers on the availability of launch systems to meet the mission requirements and b) determine additional investment not already identified and required by the ORS Office to meet 1) reduced call up timelines, 2) overall cost reduction efforts and 3) upgrades to handling/transportation equipment required to meet quick reaction timelines (defined later in the RFI). Expected payloads for this class launch system will not exceed 300kg to a 400km circular orbit at a 90 degree inclination. The ORS office is looking for launch systems that can meet this capability, but is also interested in less capable responses as well to provide knowledge of the launch capability of current and planned very small launch systems. While the ORS office is interested in and has a requirement to launch in 6 days, please discuss your capability to launch in 2 days from call-up. Discuss any assumptions that are made in a rapid call-up scenario as well as what level of pre-positioning and pre-coordinated analysis/ approvals are required. Responses should address the cost to achieve a space launch demonstration mission. If applicable, provide a breakout of Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) costs for development items such as engines/motors, avionics, and/or any hardware required such as ground infrastructure, launch pad, or unique handling equipment.
<p><strong>&bull; 6-Day Call-up: <br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>o</strong> Definition - A simulated National need for an ORS asset capability is made from USSTRATCOM to the ORS Office. The ORS Office must then deliver capability to the Warfighter 7 days later. <br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; o</strong> Assumption - Space vehicle capability is not achieved for 24 hours after separation from the launch vehicle. Therefore, from the call up to the launch is 6 days or 144 hours. <br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; o</strong> Assumption - The payload, launch vehicle and range will work to a state of readiness to support 6-day call-up operations. This means that each will define an appropriate level of pre-positioning of assets. The ORS Office will serve as the program integrator and ensure that the CONOPs is coordinated and executable across the various organizations and companies involved.<br /><strong>&bull; Payload<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> o</strong> Definition - The payload, when referenced in this and other launch documents refers to the mass above the launch vehicle interface (as defined by the LV vendor) that is to be lifted by the launch vehicle. It includes but is not limited to the satellite(s), adapter(s), separation system(s), and other hardware needed. <br /><strong>&bull; Initial Launch Capability<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o</strong> Definition - The point in time at which an execution of the 6-day call-up (or less) is possible. <br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; o</strong> Assumption - Assets are pre-positioned in a state of readiness that has been defined by the vendor and accepted by the ORS Office.</p>
<p>A specific payload has not been identified for the purposes of this RFI, rather the ORS office is interested in understanding the capability of the very small class (&lt;300kg payload) class. In addition, it would be possible to launch multiple spacecraft from a single launch vehicle and information on any concepts or hardware that supports multiple payloads should be included.</p>
<p>The ORS Office requests that vendors provide a proposed concept on their ability to execute to the mission description remaining consistent with the definitions and assumptions provided above. Responses can be in the form of either a paper or brief. Papers are limited to 25 pages using a font of reasonable size between 10 and 14 point. Briefs are limited to 50 slides and either Powerpoint or PDF are acceptable formats.</p>
<p>Define any terminology that would not be considered standard and provide assumptions used in your concept not provided in this RFI as appropriate.</p>
<p>As part of your response to the RFI, provide a ROM estimate for the execution of this mission broken out as described above. The estimate should provide total mission execution timeline from award of contract to an Initial Launch Capability, the ORS Office goal is to launch within 12 to 18 months of contract award. In the cost of the mission, it is assumed that the LV vendor will be responsible for interfacing with and procuring the range and their services.</p>
<p>Sources responding to this Request for Information (RFI) should identify any information which will enable the Government to determine industries' interest in supporting this possible mission. RFI responses will contribute to the Market Research Report as part of the acquisition strategy development process. Currently, an acquisition strategy has not been determined.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Boutiful, UT, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately&nbsp;2,961 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of&nbsp;2,575 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for&nbsp;2 years. The space must be available for occupancy by 7/1/2011. The delineated area is Bountiful, UT.
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Please send expressions of interest to the primary contact.</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest must be submitted to the above address by 4:00 PM on 6/10/2011, and must include the following information:<br />&bull; Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.<br />&bull; Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced. Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.<br />&bull; Date of space availability.<br />&bull; Method of rentable space measurement.<br />&bull; Building ownership information.<br />&bull; Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).<br />&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.<br />&bull; List of building services provided.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Combat Support Equipment (CSE), Family of Field Medical Equipment (FFME), is seeking information regarding industry capabilities and best practices for Enterprise-wide, Tiered Distribution Support for Marine Corps Class VIII materiel (medical and dental supplies and equipment) in garrison.  Initial planning contemplates combining the USMCs expertise and knowledge of its medical needs/use with those of excellent supply chain operators for achieving optimum/best value results. Planning envisions using a performance-based set of requirements to describe goals, objectives, and constraints thus allowing experienced supply chain operators to determine how best to achieve those goals.
 

Class VIII materiel consists of Authorized Medical and Dental Allowance list (AMAL/ADAL) materiel, assembled into capability sets (assemblages). See Attachment 1 (AMAL Descriptions and NSNs). Equipment assemblages contain medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and reusable materiel required to establish the basic function of the assemblage (e.g., an operating room, etc.). Supply assemblages contain consumable materiel to support the function in treating a designated number of casualties or to perform a specific task. Currently, Class VIII materiel is managed at multiple facilities that are locally controlled by Marine Corps Medical Logistics Companies (MEDLOGs).  

The current operating model is complex with numerous participants all with discrete span of control and influence.
 There are multiple parties responsible for execution of similar processes (e.g., Navy, Marines, 3PL provider, Theater Lead Agent Medical Materiel (TLAMM), etc.). There are significant opportunities to reduce costs, improve service levels, and limit inventory obsolescence. Attachment 2 (Current State & Contemplated Future 3PL Functions) sets forth current and notional future state operational models.

The future state operating model contemplates a Third Party Logistics Provider (3PL) who would conduct complete lifecycle management of the CLASS VIII garrison logistics chain. Overall objectives include promoting enhanced and sustained ready-to-issue posture of Class VIII materiel; reducing the garrison logistics burden on the operating forces; maintaining shelf-life standards and reduction of losses from expiry; providing enterprise-wide visibility and accountability; and reducing overall procurement, replenishment, and replacement costs.
  Major functions contemplated are demand management, supplier management, warehouse/inventory management/equipment preventative maintenance, invoicing, order management, transportation management, returns, and reporting.  

MCSC anticipates that this effort is a multiple year project. Further, MCSC may begin with a Concept Pilot to test the feasibility of the contemplated operating model. Upon the conclusion of the Pilot, the opportunity exists for an enterprise-wide implementation encompassing the whole of the Marine Corps Class VIII inventory. 


Request interested parties submit capabilities and experience descriptions, best practice information, and any information regarding commercial contractual arrangements.
 Capabilities may include any other relevant information.  Request interested parties provide the business information in Attachment 3 (Company Information).  An Industry Day for interested parties is tentatively planned for May 2011 at Camp Lejeune, NC.   The number of participants and attendees is limited and firms should indicate their interest in attending with their response to this RFI.  Interested firms will be notified of the date, time and other details of the Industry Day under separate cover, and will be required to provide a list of attendees.

Responses to this RFI are requested no later than 12 April 2011 to Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN: Mark Sanderson, CESS, CT023, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134.
 This information may also be submitted to mark.sanderson@usmc.mil. Submitted information will not be returned. All data received in response to this announcement marked, or designated, as corporate or proprietary information will be protected from release outside the Government in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act provisions. This RFI is for informational purposes only. This is not a request for proposal (RFP), invitation for bid (IFB), request for quotation (RFQ), or an announcement of a solicitation. No solicitation document exists. The submission of this information is for market research and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure these services, nor does the Marine Corps intend to award on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested.
 No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.

All submissions will be treated as business confidential materials, become Government property, and will not be returned.

Background

The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information & Technology (OI&T), Office of Product Development is to provide benefits and services to veterans of the United States.  In meeting these goals, OI&T strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient Information Technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout all the points of the veterans' health care in an effective, timely and compassionate manner.  VA depends on Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals.  

OI&T is responsible for the development and maintenance of VistA, a suite of software packages comprised of more than 100 applications run at 128 VA health care facilities and 887 ambulatory care and community based outpatient clinics nation-wide.  VistA provides the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) with a fully-automated electronic health record (EHR) system to support the needs of patients, clinicians, and administrators by providing vital clinical, financial, infrastructure and management tools. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is increasingly reliant on automated and interconnected systems to perform functions essential to providing patient care to our nation's Veterans.  The benefits of such activities include improved information processing and communication.  However, even as improvements in health care are implemented, there continue to be opportunities for further exploitation of technology to achieve our goal of providing the best possible care with the resources provided.
The VHA Telehealth Task Force assessed that current VA scheduling systems cannot support widespread expansion of CVT due to manual processes involved with the current inter-facility CVT consult and inability of the current VistA scheduling system to interface with other CVT scheduling technologies and resources. 
Problems with the current "as is" inter-facility CVT scheduling models for consult processes are:
1.	Manual scheduling must occur on the VistA system where the health care provider is located and the VistA system where the Veteran is located. This pair is not handled within and across VistA systems as a synchronized event and uses separate scheduling systems that do not link with VistA or various work-arounds. Therefore, it is difficult to create or modify CVT appointments.
2.	Inability to document all CVT activities including CVT event closure on both healthcare provider and Veteran's local VistA systems.
3.	Potential for clerical error and improper tracking of workload capture. There is currently not a way to show a single listing of daily scheduled CVT patients across facilities and VISNs.  Health care providers currently do not have a clear view of CVT scheduled patients.


Requirements  

The scope of this effort is for a Contractor to evaluate and detail the technical needs for inter-facility CVT scheduling; elicit, document and develop the Technical and Interface Requirements; and create a simulated demonstration of an inter-facility CVT Scheduling system.  The Contractor shall begin this work by surveying a sample subset of CVT user groups nationwide to gather technical data for the development of a future inter-facility scheduling system for CVT.  Currently, functionality exists within VistA for scheduling CVT encounters but is limited to encounters within a particular facility and new development will eventually be required for scheduling inter-facility encounters or sessions.  

 Written responses should address the following:

1.	It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information, and the requirements of the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS).  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information by June 1, 2011.  
2.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work as described in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Also, forward any questions or issues identified within the PWS.
3.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.
4.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners certified in VA's VetBiz (www.vip.vetbiz.gov) repository?
5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  
6.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

Additional Submission Information Required

Please include, at a minimum, the following information in the initial paragraph of the submission:

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Award Non-Competitive Procurement for Open Budget Index (OBI) Honduras Update 2011
<SOLNBR>MCC-11-0074-CON-21
<RESPDATE>060311
<CONTACT>Lisa Smith Kulley, Contracting Officer, Phone 2025213719, Email Smith-Kulleylm@mcc.gov
<DESC>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) desires that the Honduran nongovernmental organization which the International Budget Partnership (IBP) has selected as its local partner to carry out the 2012 Open Budget Index (OBI), the Fundaci&oacute;n Democracia Sin Fronteras (FDSF) in Honduras, produce an Update report by September 30, 2011 that tracks changes in fiscal transparency observed since September 15, 2009, the data collection cut-off date for the 2010 OBI.
<p>MCC intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) to Fundaci&oacute;n Democracia Sin Fronteras (FDSF) because they are authorized to collect the requisite data and carry out the analysis for the Open Budget Index using the IBP's proprietary instrument required to produce an Update report. FDSF can thus provide data collection, analytical and reporting services on the Honduras budget process more efficiently and quickly than any other source. IBP's US-based analytical team is already in place to analyze the survey data once the survey in Honduras is complete. Without hiring new staff or training existing staff, the IBP could quickly, efficiently, and at relatively low cost produce an update report based upon the findings from Honduras.</p>
<p>Other interested firms having the ability to furnish these services shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer demonstrating their capability to provide the required services no later than the the closing date of this announcement. All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist. This notice of intent is not a Request for Competitive Proposals and is for informational purposes only. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is soley within the discretion of the Government. This notice represents the Government's only written notice of this procurement. All questions and requests regarding this procurement shall be in writing and addressed to Lisa Smith Kulley at smith-kulleylm@mcc.gov no later than 6/3/2011. Telephone requests will not be honored.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/OAR/ARL/ATDD intends to award on a sole source basis to Remtech, Inc., 2 Red Oak Rd, Saint James, NY 11780, to upgrade ATDD's existing Remtech PAO Dopplar SODAR.&nbsp; The antenna is made of 64 piezo-electric transducers, operating at 3.85 KHz (central frequency).&nbsp; Active antenna size is 40 cm x 40 cm.&nbsp; The minimum measurement height is 15 meters.&nbsp; The average range is 700 meters.<br />The requested upgrade of ATDD's existing Remtech PAO Dopplar SODAR represents a significant advancement in measurement capability and deployment logistics for ATDD's current PAO vertical wind profiling capability.    This is an upgrade to existing ATDD PAO SODAR hardware that takes advantage of advances in signal processing and computing capability since ATDD's original purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Other  ATDD's requirements for remote vertical sounding capability, based on historical field observations conducted by ATDD and in particular those requirements applicable to ATDD's renewable energy field measurement program , include:<br /><br />1) The SODAR system must operate with the existing ATDD owned extensive REMTECH measurement and analysis software.  ATDD has completed multiple investigations to validate the measurement software acquired from Remtech.  In addition to the Remtech SODAR operating system, ATDD's signal processing and analysis software suite includes:<br /><br />Vectorial presentation of vertical profile of horizontal wind <br />Facsimile presentation of all data<br />Multi-level time series presentation of all data<br />6 dB improvement of signal processing. This is equivalent to 4-fold the power output.<br />Extended frequency coding. It gives a signal processing improvement of up to 10 dB   	(equivalent to 10-fold the output power).<br />Sigma w computation<br />Sigma u and Sigma v computation<br />Sigma theta computation<br />Automatic mixing height/depth calculation
<p>2)  Since the SODAR will be use in junction with the ATDD 30-m flux tower system, the SODAR must provide measurements at a minimum height of 20m in order to assimilate the two measurement platforms as well as evaluate measurement accuracies.</p>
<p>3)  Based on previous SODAR observations of the nocturnal jet observed at the  ATDD's Ocotillo wind farm location, the SODAR must provide an average maximum measurement height of 700m.  The average maximum height is based on an average across all atmospheric conditions with the exception of precipitation.</p>
<p>4)  The number of vertical levels (gates)	(user selectable) must be between 50-100 with a minimum range gate of 10m.</p>
<p>5)  The averaging period for reported velocity and turbulence profiles must be user selectable between 10 to 60 minutes</p>
<p>6)  The SODAR must be capable of resolving  horizontal winds over a speed range	 between 0 to 30 m/s.</p>
<p>7)  The SODAR must be capable of resolving vertical wind speed between a range of-3 to 3 m/s.</p>
<p>8)  The SODAR winds  speed accuracy should be 0.25 m/s or better.</p>
<p>9)  It is critical that the basic instrument footprint for the SODAR transducers and electronic case must be less than &lt;1 m2 with a total weight of transducers and electronics less than  30kg<br /> <br />10) The SODAR must be able to operate on either AC or battery power   with basic requirement of  12-24  volts  and must be solar capable.</p>
<p>11)  The SODAR must be capable of operating in remote environments with ambient operating ambient temperatures between	-10degrees C to +40 degrees C.<br /> <br />12)  The SODAR system must be capable of remote interrogation through WiFi, ethernet, or wireless cellular modem (wireless modem supplied by ATDD)</p>
<p>13)  Due to potential deployment within urban environments, the SODAR system must provide an ambient noise rejection algorithm.</p>

<DESC>THE 2007 NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE APPLICABLE TO THIS PROCUREMENT: 221 UTILITIES

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. 

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Washington (NAVFAC-W) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2913 which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with a gas or electric utility companies to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utilities) in order to address the requirements and circumstances of the installation.
 This contract is referred to as a Utility Energy Savings Contract (UESC). For purposes of qualifying under this notice, an entity must meet the definition of a Utility before an agreement can be initiated. 

UESCs are contracts that allow utilities to provide their federal customer agencies with comprehensive energy and water efficiency improvements and demand reduction services. In this contract NAVFAC-W requests that the utility:

1.	Provide Utility Energy and Water Surveys,
2.	Provide Financing for Energy and Water Conservation Measures,
3.	Provide the Feasibility Study for the proposed measures, 
4.	Provide complete detailed Engineering & Design Package,
5.	Provide all Construction & Installation,
6.	Provide Project Management,
7.	Provide proof of performance,
8.	Provide commissioning,
9.	Provide Measurement & Verification,
10.	Provide Training if necessary for any installed equipment, and
11.	Provide possible O&M Services for installed equipment.
Proposed energy and water conservation measures may include improvements and additions to:
1.	Building envelope,
2.	HVAC controls, HVAC equipment, distribution and water heating systems,
3.	Lighting, lighting controls and power systems,
4.	Energy management and control systems,
5.	Heat reclaim systems,
6.	Renewable energy systems,
7.	Compressed Air Equipment and Systems,
8.	Combined heat and power, distributed energy resources,
9.	Large scale ground source heat pump systems,
10.	Data Centers included servers, etc, and
11.	Metering and sub-metering when they are an acceptable ECM.
This project provides for water and energy conservation and efficiency upgrades at various locations at Naval Support Facility (NSF) Dahlgren, Dahlgren, VA.
 The primary goal of the project is to reduce energy and water consumption by implementing life-cycle cost effective energy conservation methods and increased energy efficiency equipment as well as and provide more sustainable building infrastructure at NSF Dahlgren. These improvements will be accomplished by proposing, installing and testing, new energy saving technologies to be installed, The preliminary audit will require on-site building investigation and evaluation to determine if any significant energy conservation opportunities exist and whether further detail energy analysis is warranted. The Government may elect to proceed with further phases under the UESC which include but are not limited to the feasibility study phase; the engineering and design phase; the implementation phase.
 The process requires that the responsible Utility must have the ability to provide or obtain financing on terms at least as good as those available to customers in a comparable service class, or with a comparable risk profile. Therefore, contractor will not receive compensation until completion of the implementation project, and payments will be based on a long-term (15 year) amortization schedule. 

Interested utilities may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration. The submission must include the NAICS code and Cage Code. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.
 Responses to this posting must be submitted to peter.kho@navy.mil in PDF format no later than June 15, 2010. 

All narratives shall be no longer than twenty-five (25) pages in length. Any pages after page twenty will not be evaluated.

<DESC>Description:  NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE

The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 17 , VA North Texas Health Care System (VANTHCS) , Dallas, TX, hereby gives notice of intent to award a sole source fixed price purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, on or about June 1, 2011 to AGFA HEALTHCARE CORPORATION.  
The period of performance will be for a 5 month period. Estimated cost is $253,190.75.

The prospective contractor will provide remote and onsite maintenance and repair services in support of the Radiology Department and Biomedical Engineering.

VANTHCS intends to award this requirement as a sole source to AGFA because the services are follow-on from a previous award and awarding to another source would cause unacceptable delay in service during the time required to issue a new competitive contract for an interim period awaiting award and operation of the new digital radiology imaging system and equipment.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 811219 with the size standard of $7 million. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation and technical capabilities, which, if received within fifteen calendar days of publication of this notice, will be considered. All responses must be submitted to the Government point of contact at the email address shown below. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Performance Requirements Summary.  The contractor service requirements are summarized into performance objectives that relate directly to mission essential items.  The performance threshold briefly describes the minimum acceptable levels of service required for each requirement.  These thresholds are critical to mission success.<br><br>1. The purpose of this section is to: <br><br>a. List the contract requirements considered most critical to acceptable contract performance. <br><br>b. Show the maximum allowable degree of deviation from perfect performance for each requirement, Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) that shall be allowed by the Government before contract performance is considered unsatisfactory. <br><br>c. Explain the Quality Assurance methods the Government will use to evaluate the Contractor's performance in meeting the contract requirements. <br><br>1.2. The Government's primary quality assurance procedures are based on customer complaints, spot inspections of the recurring critical output products of the contract using the concepts of ANSI/ASQC Z1.4-2003 and planned scheduling. Some contract requirements will be surveilled by use of contractor reports and customer complaints. <br><br>1.3. The criteria for acceptable and unacceptable performance are as follows: <br><br>a. For areas surveilled by sampling: Criteria derived from ANSI/ASQC Z1.4-2003 based on the lot size, sample size and the AQL for each contract requirement. The contractor will be required to re-perform services for items that are found unacceptable. When the number of defects exceeds the acceptable level or trends in non-performance appear the Contracting Officer or COR may complete a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR). The CDR requires the Contractor to explain, in writing, why performance was unacceptable, how performance will be returned to acceptable levels and how recurrence of the problem will be prevented in the future. <br><br>b. Other requirements: The criteria for non-sampled requirements were derived from estimates of the level of performance experienced when the service was accomplished by Government personnel or are the level of performance deemed acceptable to the Government. The use of the CDR, as described above, applies to these requirements as well. <br><br>2. The rights of the Government and remedies described in a PRS, which is part of the contract, are in addition to other rights and remedies set forth in the contract. Specifically, the Government reserves its contract rights under the Inspection/Acceptance (52.212-4(a)) and the Termination for Cause (52.212-4(m)) clauses. These rights and remedies also apply to validated deficiencies found through customer complaints and stumble-on observations surfaced during the performance of the contract. <br><br>3. The contractor will be notified of any deficiency from the PRS and shall take appropriate corrective action. In the event a CDR is issued, the contractor shall explain in writing why performance was unsatisfactory, how performance will be brought into compliance with contract specifications and standards, and how recurrence of the problem will be prevented in the future. <br><br>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT SUMMARY (SEPARATE ATTACHMENT 2)<br>

STATEMENT OF WORK

HYDROMAGNETIC MATERIAL TESTING FOR NOVEL JOINT REPLACEMENT TECHNOLOGY (CID#: NMCSD.NHU.201.0004) FOR RESEARCH FOR ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY DEPARTMENT, NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER, SAN DIEGO


Part 1: Introduction
Part 2: Performance Requirements
Part 3: Quality Control
Part 4: Government Furnished Facility Property
Part 5: General Information


Part 1: Introduction

Performance Based Statement of Work.
 

The contractor shall perform work as described in this Performance Based Statement of Work (PBSOW). The requirement is to provide equipment, expertise, and labor in order to perform analysis of a hydromagnetic spinal implant device.   Overall 20 cadaver spines will be included in this study. The hydromagnetic devices ability to perform similar to the normal anatomy and resist axial load will be tested using a biaxial servohydraulic MTS 858 Machine (MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, Minnesota). Initially all spinal segments will be nondestructively tested for stiffness and range of motion to document the per-implant condition. Ten of the spines will then be tested to failure by constantly increasing the axial loading until failure occurs.
 The remaining ten spines will then be implanted with the new device. All surgeries will be supervised by an experienced fellowship trained spine surgeon from NMCSD. 
Initially, nondestructive testing for defining the construct stiffness (measured in Nmm/degree) and range of motion (ROM, measured in degrees) will be performed, in right and left torsion, and left lateral bending, Flexion and extension. Multi-level mechanics consisting of 4 vertabrae (2 on top and 2 below the artificial segment) will be tested with the free ends of the specimens embedded in polyester resin with custom fixation. Data on construct stiffness (measured in Nmm/degree) and range of motion (ROM, measured in degrees) will be obtained in right and left torsion, right and left bending, flexion, and extension.
 For flexion-extension and lateral bending, a cantilever beam will apply unconstrained moments of + 4.5 Nm with use of a displacement control rate of 2mm/sec. For axial torsion, each specimen will be mounted in-line with the machine actuator and a 100-N axial load will be applied with cyclic moments between + Nm at an angle control rate of 2 deg/sec. 

Before mechanical testing, each specimen will be prepared for kinematic analysis by rigidly attaching Kirschner wires (1.5 mm diameter) in the midline of each vertebral body parallel to the plane of motion. Retro-reflective markers (4mm diameter) will then be attached to the end of each wire to define a rigid coordinate system. All deformation is assumed to occur in the soft tissue (discs), so that the vertebral bodies act as rigid bodies.
 Relative motion between reflective markers will be measured with use of a four-camera noncontact motion-measurement system (Qualisys, Gothenburg, Sweden) to obtain kinematic data. A custom software program utilizing Euler angle calculation for the plane of motion being tested will be used to measure the range of motion in flexion-extension, right lateral bending, left lateral bending, and axial torsion. Kinematic data (measured in degrees) will be sampled at 10 Hz for the duration of each test. Specimen stability will then be evaluated by determining their moment-rotation behavior based on the biomechanical stiffness and range of motion. 

Mechanical data for displacement (measured in millimeters), force (Newtons), angle (degrees), torque (Newton-meters) will be sampled at 10 Hz for the duration of each test.
 

Subsequently, destructive testing will be performed by axially loading the specimens till failure. Axial force will be increased till either the spine or the device fails. Mode of failure and force at failure will be recorded. 

Data of the entire construct (Nm/deg) and range of motion (degrees) will be reported as average + standard deviation. All calculations will be performed using a custom-designed MATLABTM (Mathworks, Inc. Natick, MA) program. 

The Contractor shall be solely responsible for any and all liability caused by the acts or omissions of its agents or employees. The Contractor shall not in any manner represent or infer that it is an instrumentality or agent of the United States Government.

The Contractor shall recognize that the Commander, Naval Medical Center San Diego maintains administrative and operational responsibility for all activities carried on in support of the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) and may take such actions as necessary to preserve and maintain the integrity of the MTF, subject to the limitations prescribed by law and U.S.
 Navy regulations and Federal law.

This contract is a true performance based contract in that it states what needs to be done; the Performance Standards specify the outcomes and deliverables expected for and from these services; and the Contractor Quality Control (Part 3) tells how performance will be assessed.

Scope of Work.

The contactor will provide equipment, expertise, and labor in order to perform the prototype hydromagnetic spinal implant analysis for research for the orthopedic surgery department at Naval Medical Center San Diego and report findings to LT Barlow or LCDR Carney quarterly throughout the period of performance. 

Contractor will be a PhD in Biomechanical Engineering, have previous research experience in the area of
orthopedic biomechanical research, have published research experience with orthopedic biomechanical research design, have good communication and presentation skills, and fluency in English.

Hours of Service:

The proposed project has been designed by active duty physicians from the Naval Medical Center San Diego Orthopedic Surgery Department.
  Active duty physicians will be involved in prototype design and production.  However, NMCSD currently lacks a biomechanics lab capable of supporting this research.  Historically, there has been a positive working relationship between the NMCSD Orthopedic Surgery Department and the Orthopedic Biomechanical Research Center (San Diego, CA).  The OBRC has been instrumental in carrying out biomechanical studies in conjunction with the NMCSD Orthopedic Surgery Department in the past.  We look to build on this existing working relationship with the OBRC and use their equipment and expertise to conduct this biomechanical study.  The grant funds will be applied to conducting the biomechanical study of the hydromagnetic device.

Part 2.
 Performance Requirements

Model testing as described above using MTS 858 bi-axial servo-hydraulic materials testing machine according to engineering standards and using RealTime (3.2, Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA) and Orthotrak (5.03, Motion Analysis Corp.) biomechanical software to track the performance of the hydromagnetic  vertebral implant.  

Perform statistical analysis of the performance of the native vertebral segment compared to the prototype hydromagnetic spinal implant device.  In order to evaluate the influence of the implant on these parameters, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) will be incorporated. Statistical significance will be determined using an alpha level of 0.05.
 Since interactions are based on an optimal combination of several dependent variables in a MANOVA, no correction in the significance level is needed.

Summarize results at six months after project initiation

Comprehensive model analysis and interpretation

Summarize findings into images, tables, reports, abstracts and manuscripts for acceptance into peer-reviewed scientific and medical journals

Assist in the preparation of the presentation of findings at scientific meetings and conferences or other
venues in the area of interest.


Communicate with LT Barlow and/or LCDR Joseph Carney via phone, e-mail, or teleconference on a minimum of a biweekly basis and as needed regarding project progress, issues and guidance on ongoing project evolution, altering model when directed by LT Barlow or LCDR Carney.

Part 3.
 Quality Control

Contractor will provide summary report of analysis at six months after project initiation.

Part 4. Government Furnished Facility Property

The U.S. government will furnish no tangible or intangible property in support of this activity. The contractor will be required to supply, at no cost to the government, any tangible or intangible materials required for him to complete this work. The contractor is expected to maintain telephone and computer access at his expense so that NMCSD others associated with the project can communicate effectively and efficiently with the contractor in a timely fashion.


Part 5: General Information

 NMCSD is bound by the United States Code, the Code of Federal Regulations and Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 Nothing in this Statement of Work overrides these aforementioned statutes, laws, directives, instructions, and guidelines, Contractor will be paid for:
Engineering supervision performed at the Orthopedic Biomechanics Research by the Director, Diana Glaser, PhD. 

An experienced sub-engineer will be utilized for the study testing as well.  In addition, a technician will be utilized to assist the investigators in tissue preparation, dissection, assistance with the implantation, building and modifying existing fixation for the MTS machine, performing the testing and analyzing the data. 

As the specimens arrive in OBRC facilities, we will CT scan them to ensure that all of free of bone diseases and do not show significant signs of arthritis.
 We will also determine the bone density, as this plays an important role in the failure characteristics.  Each scan will be performed in Rady Childrens hospital. 

In addition we will fluoroscope the spines after implantation and after failure to ensure the correct position of the implant and define the failure mode.  Fluoroscopic video and CT scans are taken at Rady Childrens Hospital according to a standardized protocol, de-identified, given a reference number and processed further for data analysis. 

There are flexion/extension, lateral bending, axial rotation and failure testing to be performed for the 10 spines without implantation, resulting in 4 tests per spine or a total of 40 tests.
 The 10 spines that require implantation will be tested before and after implantation for flexion/extension, lateral bending, axial rotation, resulting in 6 tests per spine, totaling 60 tests. Additionally, those spines will be tested after implantation till failure, resulting in another 10 tests.

Our statistical analysis revealed that we need 10 lumber spines per group to ensure significance in the most variables. Each lumbar spine specimen will have serology testing performed in usual fashion.  All tissue will be ordered to be from a similar population with no obvious recorded bone diseases or bone cancer. 

Additional hardware and supply costs are anticipated for a new load cell (required to capture the forces in the specified range more correctly); Hardware associated with this project (including a modification of the existing MTS fixation for the spinal testing to perform the required testing) and supplies and consumable expenses.

Responsibility and Inspection: unless otherwise specified in the order, the supplier is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements and quality control. The following FAR provision and clauses are applicable to this procurement: 

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition:

52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (JUN 2008), Subparagraph (c) of the referenced provision is changed to 90 days; 
52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999), the fill-in for Subparagraph (a) is:

The factors are listed in order of importance.
 Non-price evaluation factors, when combined, would be significantly more important than Price.

(I) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT
(II) PAST PERFORMANCE 
(III) PRICE 

The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the two non-price factors. 

Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the products offered as either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.
 

Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii). Under this factor, the Government will rate past performance as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 

For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price. 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
 

TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures, drawings or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. In addition, each offer shall address each of the system requirements. Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation. Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.
 

Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has an acceptable record of past performance. A proposal that receives a rating of acceptable on past performance is one that demonstrates little anticipated risk in the areas of quality of the product, timely delivery, and customer satisfaction. Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies and subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement.
 

Offers that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any Offerors proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government. Thus, the Contracting Officer may determine it is an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation. Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information.

<p>Instructions to Offerors:</p>
<p>FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JUN 2008) is hereby incorporated by reference. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. Written proposals shall include a technical description of the services being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements of the solicitation. NOTE: All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive an award from the Government. The Offeror's signed offer shall be prepared as a PDF and submitted electronically via email to Jeanne.rossetsky@dot.gov to arrive no later than 1:00 p.m. EST on June 20, 2011. Proposals submitted via facsimile or U.S. Mail are not authorized and late responses will not be considered. The Government will not pay for any information received.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Offers:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) Technical merit/approach; (ii) work management; (iii) past performance; and (iv) staffing. Technical merit/approach is significantly more important than work management, past performance and staffing individually. Work Management, Past Performance and Staffing are weighted equally. When combined, the technical factors are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.</p>
<p>The Offeror's technical description will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria described below:</p>
<p>1. Technical Merit/Approach (limit to 5 pages)</p>
<p>a. A written explanation demonstrating the Offeror's technical understanding and approach to meet the requirements of the SOW. In addition, the Offeror is required to explain the approach it would use in carrying out the required monthly maintenance to include schedule and process.</p>
<p>b. The Offeror shall address the major technical and operational factors of the SOW, identify the risks inherent in this type of work, and an explanation of an approach to minimize these risks. An example would be "Does the Offeror have replacement cameras/card readers in stock if either needs to be sent to the shop to be fixed?"</p>
<p>2. Work Management (limit to 5 pages)</p>
<p>Provide a written explanation demonstrating the Offeror's ability to manage and track the preventative maintenance of the secure access system each month. In particular, the Offeror shall explain how it will ensure the technician is not conducting preventative maintenance on the same components each month and neglecting other components.</p>
<p>3. Past Performance (limit to 2 pages per summary)</p>
<p>a. The Offeror shall provide three recently completed (within the last five years) project summaries, which briefly describe relevant experience. Each project summary should provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Identify the customer (agency or client);<br />(ii) name of Government Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). If non-government, name of customer point of contact (POC);<br />(iii) Provide POC information (Address, phone number, and, if applicable, <br />e-mail address of the POC; and/or CO and COTR.<br />(iv) Provide contract number (and if applicable, Task/Delivery Order number); <br />(v) identify resources and cost expended;<br />(vi) identify the period of performance;<br />(vii) provide a brief description of the scope of the contract;<br />(viii) provide a brief discussion of its relevance to this work; and<br />(ix) Identify role of proposed key person (if any).</p>
<p>b. If the Offeror has no relevant past performance history, it must affirmatively so state. Offerors with no relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably under this factor, in accordance with FAR 15.305. In the case of a relatively new firm (i.e., established within the last 18 months), the Offeror may submit past performance information for contracts on which its corporate management has performed, to supplement any past performance information for the firm itself. This shall be specifically noted in the proposal submission.</p>
<p>4. Staffing (limit to 2 pages per resume)</p>
<p>The Offeror shall submit, at a minimum, resumes for each actual or proposed employee working in the respective key personnel position (Program Manager who must be trained in Lenel Software).</p>
<p>Representations and Certifications:</p>
<p>All Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (APR 2011). An Offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.    This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

Solicitation number HSCG38-11-Q-300058 is assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). 

The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. 

This Solicitation is issued as a total small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the small business size standard is 1000 employees. 

Firm Fixed Price quotes are requested for the purchase of the following HC-130H Aircraft Skins with a Holographic Decal to evidence a Lockheed Martin source inspection.  The Aircraft Skins are for the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) H-C130H aircraft of which Lockheed Martin is the manufacturer of the aircrafts airframe structure.   Lockheed Martin is not the manufacturer of the aircraft skins but has authorized manufacturers via certified licenses to produce the material. Hologram products produced by certified manufacturers have a serial number that Lockheed Martin maintains in a master database thereby allowing Lockheed Martin to recall part information instantly. 

CLIN 1:  AIRCRAFT SKIN with Holographic Decal:  P/N: 338328-6R,  NSN: 1560-01-344-7674, , Qty: 2 Each.   

CLIN 2:  AIRCRAFT SKIN with Holographic Decal, P/N: 338328-22R, NSN: 1560-01-344-7676, Qty: 2 Each. 

CLIN 3:  AIRCRAFT SKIN with Holographic Decal, P/N: 338328-8R  NSN: 1560-01-513-8369, Qty:  2 each.  

CLIN 4: AIRCRAFT SKIN with Holographic Decal, P/N: 338328-23L NSN: 1560-01-457-0968,  Qty:  2 Each.  

CLIN 5: AIRCRAFT SKIN with Holographic Decal, P/N: 338328-20R  NSN: 1560-01-344-7678, , Qty:  1 each. 

CLIN 6:  AIRCRAFT SKIN with Holographic Decal , P/N: 338328-22L  NSN: 1560-01-520-4662, , Qty:  2 Each.  

Description of the Requirement:   Aircraft Skins must be Lockheed Martin Certified evidenced by a distinct Holographic Decal and manufactured by a Lockheed Martin approved facility.  A list of Lockheed Martin Certified Licensees is publicly available at               http://www.lockheedmartin.com/aeronautics/global-sustainment/hologram-products/certified-parts-licensees-list.html.

<p><br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number H92257-11-Q-0029 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39 and DFARS Change Notice DCN 20100408. The proposed is un-restricted. The associated NAICS code is 721110 with a standard business size of $30.0M. A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract is contemplated. Marine Corps Special Operations Command, Camp Lejeune North Carolina, has a one-time requirement to procure:
<p>HOTEL AND LODGING SERVICES (SEE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF WORK FOR COMPLETE DETAILS)</p>
<p>The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract. The evaluation factors for this RFQ are technical capability / delivery, past performance and price. Catagorically, evaluation factors will be weighed in this order of precedence; technical capability / delivery date, past performance and price. The Government intends to make award based on best value. "Best value" means the expected outcome of the acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.

<DESC>The following answers are in response to questions received from Contractors as of 27 May 2011: <br><br>Q1: Please describe what is meant by "fixed facility with all assets available is acceptable"?<br>A1: The fixed facility would need to provide everything outlined within the statement of work and it is required to be set up and broken down by the contractor. It is also needed to provide its own power and waste disposal, etc.<br><br>Q2: Are the lab supplies just the capital equipment (e.g., the EKG<br>machine) or are the supplies for the equipment needed as well?<br>A2: The lab equipment, to include the ekg really just needs the capital equipment, I think they usually come with razors, etc. that's not necessary. However, any specific equipment needed to run the equipment is necessary, for example, if they require specific cartridges.<br><br>Q3: One constraint we identified when preparing for this was we could not procure lead curtains in time however we use the Nomad portable x-ray with lead vests so they are not needed.  Would this be an issue?<br>A3: The lead vests would be an acceptable replacement. <br><br>Please send any questions to john.w.fields02@gmail.com and john.w.fields.civ@mail.mil.

(a) To fulfill the statutory requirements relating to Pub. L. 109-218, part of the Stafford Act, contracting officers may set-aside solicitations to allow only offerors residing or doing business primarily in the area affected by such major disaster or emergency to compete (see Subpart 26.2).

The set-aside shall be based on a specific geographic area, within a Presidential declaration(s) of disaster or emergency. 6.603 Use of procedures other than set-aside. When implementing the Stafford Act preference by using procedures other than a set-aside under section 6.602, the requirements for a justification to support the use of this authority are in 6.303. These procurements qualify as other than full and open competition.<BR><BR>This solicitation will be set aside to sellers located in Tennessee in accordance with Stafford Act Section 307.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (amendment 1) is to post questions/answers posed and clarify information.

Q - Is the contractor required to purchase the empty fuel barrels to transport both the 100 LL from Atqasuk to Umiat, the 100LL waste from Atqasuk to Kotzbue and the Jet A fuel from Barrow to Atqasuk? 
A - It is the vendors responsibility to account for all necessary charges associated with the tasks.  The 55 gal drums left in Umiat will become Government property.  The 55 gal drums utilized for the transport of waste fuel and transport of remaining quantities of 100LL to Selawik National Wildlife Refuge will not be left behind; therefore, not become Government property.   
Clarification, it is the vendors responsibility to dispose of waste fuel according to Federal, State, Local and FAA regulations.

<DESC>Amendment 4.  This provides information which is additional to previous Amendments.<br /> <br />1.	Attachment SF 1449 Changes.pdf is provided to <br />a.	change Contracting Officer and Due Date:<br /> <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All sections of the proposal shall be sent by email to the Contracting Officer (CO) at Scott.L.Stallsmith@nga.mil and to the Contract Specialist at Judith.A.Hart@nga.mil by 1600 hours EST, Tuesday, 7 June 2011 (see SF 1449 Revised page 36). </strong></span></em>
<p>b.	change Direct Personal Productive Hour basis from 1860 to 1848 hours. (see SF 1449 Revised page 5).</p>
<p>c.	change Attention line for Service of Protest to read ATTN: AC/ACH/Mail Stop S84-ACH (Mr. S. Stallsmith). (see SF 1449 Revised page 34).</p>
<p><br />2.	  Attachment PWS 9 May Revised 27 May.pdf replaces all previous PWS versions to<br />a.	Revise Government estimates for Paragraph 5 Workload Estimates are 1) approximately 462 hours per year from an experienced program manager, 2) approximately 1800 hours per year from a Cadre of Certified, Cleared (TS/SCI) Leadership Coaches, and 3) approximately 924 hours per year for a Program Coordinator</p>
<p>b.	Restore Appendix B Data Item B004 to original for Quarterly Program Management Reviews.</p>
<p>3.	 PWS Attachment 8 is revised to contain only 1 fill-in column which is titled "Labor Rate".</p>
<p>Question 10 (Q10).  FebBiz on 5/24/11 indicated replacement pages for 36, 48, 49, 53, and 54 were to be provided. We are only able to find replacement page for 36. Will the others be posted as Amendment 3?<br />Answer 10 (A10).  Replacement pages dated 19 May for 36, 48, 49, 53, and 54 were provided in Amendment 2 in Attachment changes.pdf. Then, only page 36 was revised again and was attached to Amendment 3 dated 24 May 11.</p>
<p>Q11. PWS, pages 1-6, paragraphs 1.2 Leadership Coaching within NGA, page 2<br />How many leaders do you anticipate will receive coaching during a contract year?  <br />A11. Approximate hours (Paragraph 5 Workload Estimates in PWS) describes the level of effort anticipated, capturing the number of leaders expected to receive coaching.</p>
<p>Q12. Please describe course objectives for the NGA courses that integrate coaching: Dynamics of Strategic Leadership (DSL) and Leading Culture by Design (LCBD).  <br />A12.  DSL-participants have the opportunity to further develop the knowledge, skills and attitude that will help them successfully lead in the NGA next and after next environment. <br /> LCBD-senior executives explore values, actions and behaviors and how they shape organizational culture</p>
<p>Q13. What are the prerequisites or selection process for participation in the Dynamics of Strategic Leadership and Leading Culture by Design courses?<br />A13.  All attendees must be nominated by their key component</p>
<p>Q14. PWS, pages 1-6, paragraph 3.2.2 HD Sponsored Leadership Coaching, page 5 What is the current typical frequency and duration of a coaching engagement at NGA?<br />A14. For proposal purposes, the level of effort anticipated covers the frequency and duration of a coaching engagement at NGA.<br />Q15.What is the protocol for referring clients for coaching?  What are some reason(s) NGA leaders are referred for coaching?<br />A15. There is no formal protocol in place.  Leadership coaching is strategically planned and offers are made to seniors and graduates of leadership curriculum.  Individual requests are reviewed based on the identified goals and expected</p>
<p>Q16. PWS, pages 7-13, paragraph 3.2.6 Leadership Coaching Program Metrics, page 7 Please describe NGA competencies for first-line leaders?<br />A.16  Paragraph 3.2.6 doesn't mention anything about competencies for first-line leaders.  Also, to be called a leader doesn't mean the employee is in a position based supervisory assignment</p>
<p>Q18.	PWS, Page 15, CDRL Item B004 is listed as Transition and Implementation Plan, which duplicates B002 on the same page. In the separate Appendix B, page 2, Item B004 is Quarterly Program Management Reviews and references PWS 4.1 which has nothing to do with Reviews. Will you please confirm that Quarterly Program Management Reviews are or are not a deliverable, and amend the PWS for clarity?</p>
<p>A18. CDRL B004 should be the Quarterly Program Management Review, and should reference PWS 3.2.6. In Amendment 3, CDRL B004 inadvertently duplicated CDRL B002.  The Quarterly Program Management Reviews are the correct B004 deliverables.<br /> <br />Q19. PWS, Page 14, CDRL Item B001 references three items: "the white paper", "NGA's Leadership Coaching Program Initiatives" and PWS section 3.1; however PWS 3.1 makes no mention of a white paper or the term NGA Leadership Coaching Program Initiatives. The "white paper" is to be delivered to the Government Leadership Coaching Program Manager and Quarterly updates are to be provided. And PWS 3.1, page 3, 3rd paragraph refers to a "Corporate Culture of Coaching strategy document", while the first bullet just below it references NGA's Leadership Coaching Culture Strategy document.<br />*	Are these four separate terms intended to represent the same single document or are there multiple documents or plans? <br />*	Will NGA please clarify or amend the PWS and CDRL so that each of these terms is defined and consistently used and so that the deliverables and expectations are clear?</p>
<p>A19. There is only one document required by CDRL B001 titled "NGA Leadership Coaching Culture Strategy"; in the description we list this as a type of white paper.  The NGA Leadership Coaching Culture Strategy is listed in PWS 3.1.</p>
<p>Q20. The "Corporate Culture Strategy" that is described in the third paragraph of PWS 3.1 is referenced in CDRL B002, this is noted in the last bullet under PWS 3.1, this is separate from the NGA Leadership Coaching Culture Strategy.<br /> <br />*	PWS, Page 5, under bullet "For both HD-Sponsored and KC client customized the Contractor shall... the 4th sub-bullet reads:<br /> <br />*	"Develop LC Partner Agreements and associated proposals of services including services description, estimated cost, duration and other things deemed appropriate for KC sponsored clients." <br />*	Is this fourth bullet only for KC sponsored clients, or for both HD-Sponsored and KC client customized services per the header bullet?<br />*	Are these additional proposals and costs to be based on rates we will have already provided in Attachment 8- Labor Categories Worksheet, or on some other basis, e.g. on a case by case basis given that different types of services may require different capabilities, expertise and rates?<br />*	Furthermore, will this additional work be FFP, FFP/LOET or some other rate/contract and under which CLIN should they be submitted?</p>
<p>A20. The fourth bullet under PWS 3.2.4 is for both HD and KC sponsored client customized services (HD is a KC within NGA).  CDRL B008 is broken out into an "A" and "B" section, describing the deliverables that are necessary for both KC and HD sponsored services.<br /> Any CLIN 0003, 0103, 0203 and 0303 KC-sponsored additional work and prices will be FFP/LOET based on rates vendor will have already provided in proposal's Attachment 8 (Revised) - Labor Categories Worksheet.<br /> <br />Q21. RFP SF 1449, Pages 2, 3 and 4, CLINs 0003, 0103, 0203, 0303. <br /> <br />*	Are we to provide for each CLIN on pages 2, 3 and 4 a labor rate for each Labor category, aligned with Attachment 8, or are the rates we provide in Attachment 8 sufficient documentation? <br />*	Should we assume NGA is only looking for labor rates per hour for these CLINs?<br />*	Will NGA please provide Word versions of its PDF documents SF1449, the final RFP, final amended PWS, and other attachments that will be submitted?</p>
<p>A21. Labor rates only requested for FFP/LOET CLINS 0003, 0103, etc. Attachment 8 (Revised) should cover the Base year plus Option Years 1-3, this form should be filled out in its entirety.  You will list proposed labor categories in Attachment 8.  <br /> <br />Q22. For total clarity, will NGA please provide a complete list of which services and hours are to be included in the pricing and Basis of Estimate for each CLIN?</p>
<p>A22. Please see PWS paragraph 5 for a complete detailed listing of the workload requirements by labor category.<br /> <br />Q23. Is NGA seeking a single total $ amount for each CLIN? Or multiple totals for each CLIN based on multiple labor categories?</p>
<p>A23. Each set of three CLINs (e.g. 001,002,003 is base year) represents the base or an option year under the contract. Please provide a total $ for each CLIN. Also, Attachment 8 (Revised) should provide a cost breakout by labor category by year.</p>
<p>Q24.  When does NGA intend to have written discussions, hold oral discussions if required, and award this contract, barring unforeseen delays?</p>
<p>A24.  TBD. <br /> <br />Q25.  Tiered hourly coaching rates are common across the coaching industry, used so that the level of coaching expertise can be matched to the level of the leader or type of service provided, e.g. group/team coaching, OD initiatives, succession, advanced assessments, etc. Will NGA accept multiple coaching hourly labor rates to align the right level of coach with the right level of coaching clients or services? If so, where and how would NGA prefer the tiered rates to be displayed?</p>
<p>A25.  Labor rates only requested for FFP/LOET CLINS 0003, 0103, etc., and are suggested to follow example in Attachment 8 (Revised), covering the Base year plus Option Years 1-3, this form should be filled out in its entirety.  You will list proposed labor categories in Attachment 8.  <br /></p>

General Instructions</strong>
<p>1.0 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-48. <br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a requirement for Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop managed services. This requirement is solicited as a Full and Open Competition and competed solely through the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov). The associated contract clauses and statement of work are included with this synopsis/solicitation are provided with this solicitation. <br /><br />All vendors interested in submitting a proposal for consideration should do so, prior to the solicitation closing date, in the form of an email to the point of contact listed in this solicitation. All submissions should be in accordance with the stipulations set forth below: <br /><br />1.1 The proposal shall be clear and concise and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation. The Offeror should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements. The Offeror should assume the Government has no prior knowledge of its capabilities and experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's proposal.<br /><br />1.2 Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed artwork, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired. <br /><br />1.3 The proposal packages must be received on the date and time specified in Block 8 on Page 1 of this RFP. Submissions should not contain attachments greater then 5MB in size. Such submissions may be excluded. <strong>Proposals shall be submitted to Scott Stallsmith at scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than June 6, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time.<br /></strong><br />1.4 Proposals submitted after the time and date specified for receipt of the RFP will be considered LATE in accordance with FAR 52.215-1 (JAN 2004), Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition. <br /><br />1.5 Written requests for clarification may be sent to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at the title of the e-mail must include "URHD QUESTION". The content of a question may be included in a notification or answer to all Offerors, but if so included will not divulge the source of the question. All questions and answers will be posted on the FedBizOpps website prior to the closing date of the RFP. <strong>All questions need to be submitted to scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than June 1, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time. <br /></strong><br />1.6 Small Business Subcontracting Plan<br />Each Large Business Offeror shall provide a Small Business Subcontracting Plan that contains all the elements required by FAR 52.219-9 Alt III (July 2010). This plan shall be submitted separately from the Small Business Participation Approach information required below, which applies to both large and small businesses. An approved Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not a requirement for evaluation in source selection, but rather a requirement for award to a large business and will be incorporated into any resultant contract.<br /><br />1.7 Proposal shall be based on open market pricing. <br /><br />1.8 The government will make award based on a Best Value Trade-off analysis on the submitted proposals. <br /><br />1.9 All offerors must either be registered on the ORCA website or submit a completed version of the Offeror Representations and Certifications (please see Section 6.0 of this RFP). <br /><br /><strong>1.10 Identify in your proposal any particular security restrictions, deliverables, or any other URHD requirements in the SOW or other associated attachments that would restrict implementation of the Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop here in NGA.<br /></strong><br /><strong>II. General Information</strong></p>
<p>1.0 Prospective offerors are cautioned against contacting other Government personnel in regard to this solicitation prior to award. Prospective Offerors are also cautioned to advise potential subcontractors or teaming contractors of this instruction. If such contact occurs and is found too prejudicial to competing Offerors, the Offeror (including subcontractors or teaming partners) making such contact may be excluded from award consideration. Only responses from the Contracting Officer in writing shall be considered for purposes of this procurement.</p>
<p>The Government will use the data and information gathered in the course of this pilot to determine the feasibility of SaaS, Computing to Go Service Models, and Public/Private Cloud Computing for NGA. If this proof of concept is successful, NGA intends to procure these services agency-wide through a competitive acquisition. As such, pursuant to DFARS 227.7202-1(c)(1), the Service Provider is required to provide deliverables detailing changes to or within the Government's hardware and software systems with Government Purpose Rights, as defined in DFARS Clause 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014. This will enable NGA to provide potential vendors in the follow-on competitive procurement with the information necessary for modifying the Government system to enable these services through any commercial vendor.</p>
<p>If the Service Provider wishes to assert more restrictive rights than Government Purpose Rights in any deliverable or part thereof, it shall do so in accordance with DFARS Clause 252.227-7017. Any Government requests to validate asserted restrictions will be done in accordance with the procedures in DFARS Clause 252.227-7019.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Special Notice - Special Use of Contractor Support </strong></p>
<p>a. The Government will use MITRE personnel for administrative, technical, and price analysis support during source selection. The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government. Proprietary information submitted in response to this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended (41 U.S.C. 423) (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") as implemented in the FAR. MITRE personnel are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information. Contractor personnel assisting in the proposal evaluation are procurement officials within the meaning of the Act, and will take all necessary action to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of a competing Contractor's proprietary data. Non-Disclosure and Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificates for all contractor support personnel participating in this source selection are on file at the respective contracting activities.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.0 Restrictions of Briefings </strong></p>
<p>During the period of source selection, which begins with release of this Request for Proposal (RFP) and ends with contract award, briefings by potential Offerors to Government agencies on the subject matter of this RFP are inappropriate. Conducting such a briefing without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer may be justification for eliminating your company from further consideration under this RFP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ITEMS and ITEMS - Pilots Background Information<br /></span><br /></strong>NGA is a Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Support Agency that provides Geospatial-Intelligence to both the DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC). NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate Geospatial-Intelligence in support of National Security. The Director of NGA is the functional manager for the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG), which is the combination of people, technology, policies, capabilities, doctrine, activities and community necessary to produce Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) in an integrated multi-intelligence environment to support National Security Strategy objectives.</p>
<p>NGA is looking to change how the agency procures and provisions Information Technology in order to meet expanding mission requirements given budgetary constraints. NGA plans on implementing a managed services model that decreases complexity, increases agility, enhances reliability, while improving efficiency and effectiveness of IT delivery in support of the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). NGA intends to implement these services under the consolidated Information Technology Enterprise Managed Services (ITEMS) program. In order to position the agency for successful implementation of this program, NGA is currently executing risk reduction activities and intends to award several pilots as part of these activities. The purpose of the pilot activities is to explore commercially available technologies for application in NGA facilities as well as external sites. The four pilots being contemplated are Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop (URHD) pilot, Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot, User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot, and Deployed Services (DS) pilot.</p>
<p>The URHD pilot will explore the use of a commercial Cloud as an alternative to in-house solutions. The outcome of this pilot is to determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity at a commodity price; free up one-third of data center floor space for other uses; flatten recapitalization spikes; provide efficiencies that will free up other IT resources for repurposing toward mission; and provide 24 x 7 access to voice, email, data and cloud applications via Personal Information Technology Devices (PITDs), Smart Phones, etc. NGA expects that the pilot will drive out policy concerns and solutions.</p>
<p>The Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot will explore a flexible, on-demand alternative to standard government owned data centers. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity to provide parallel operations that allows thin client transition; parallel dissemination operations; on-demand flexible capacity to allow rapid provisioning of it services; and benefit from the elimination of expensive facility modifications in limited data center space.</p>
<p>The User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot will explore flexible, on-demand alternatives to government owned user-facing hardware. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: eliminate need for multiple thin-clients at the desktop; modern, flexible, user-facing hardware; replacement or augmentation of voice and video services; and implementation of mobile thin-client devices.</p>
<p>The Deployed Services (DS) pilot will explore flexible, cross-security domain collaboration capabilities. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: deployed personnel collaboration capability for use by deployed personnel in crisis; CONUS and OCONUS situations; and a deployed PITD capability, regardless of whether an existing cell phone network exists.</p>
<p>These four pilots form an integrated architecture that mirrors the ITEMS operational objective architecture, albeit at a reduced capability and scope. By demonstrating this reduced architecture, NGA will gain high confidence in the feasibility of implementing the ITEMS approach, and detailed knowledge of how to structure the enterprise ITEMS acquisition.</p>

<DESC><p>The solicitation response date has been change to June 10, 2011 at 3:00pm.<br /><br />The Statement of Work as been amended to add this information:<br /><br />The text below is to replace Section 5b., Paragraph #4 in the SOW for National Library of Medicine Internet Connectivity.<br /><br />Additionally, NLM's Internet connection circuits must be physically diverse from the NIH/CIT campus Internet connection at two known locations. These two locations are: (1) the circuit infrastructure on the NIH/CIT campus and (2) the POP of the current NIH/CIT circuit provider, AboveNet. The AboveNet POP is located on Boone Ave in Tyson's Conner, VA. The exact route of the circuit between NIH/CIT and the AboveNet POP is not known to NLM, and therefore diversity cannot be evaluated for the entire circuit route that the vendor proposes.<br />The NIH/CIT campus Internet connection is currently provided by AboveNet fiber that is patched from the Rockville Pike egress near Wilson Drive to the NIH-owned duct bank on the NIH campus. From there it runs to NIH Building 12 over NIH communications infrastructure.<br />In order to provide physical diversity for NLM from the NIH campus connection described above, the vendor is strongly encouraged to use the existing dedicated fiber conduit currently installed between Rockville Pike and NLM Building 38A. This conduit originates from the manhole just south of Center Drive/Jones Bridge Road on Rockville Pike and terminates in the NLM Building 38A Frame Room. This conduit has available capacity for additional fiber. The vendor is also free to propose an alternative connection into NLM that is diverse from the NIH/CIT Internet connection.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Statement of Work<br />NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR Shipyard Package<br />NCND6000-11-02931</p>
<p>A. GENERAL INFORMATION<br />This Statement of Work contains the requirements for shipyard repairs to the NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR R-6701. The contractor must be located within a reasonable transit distance from the vessel's home port in Monterey, CA, generally within 12-14hrs.</p>
<p>All work is to be accomplished at the contractor's facility. NOAA will deliver the NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR R-6701 to the contractor's facility. Delivery of the vessel back to the Government shall be at the contractor's facility. Because the vessel is in high demand, scheduled far in advance, and must also be available for emergency response activities with minimal downtime, the repair work must be conducted in the following time periods:</p>
<p>June 13 - July 9, 2011: All Phase One Tasks - Vessel Alongside<br />November 5-30, 2011: All Phase Two Tasks - Vessel Hauled</p>
<p>The government at its discretion may allow Phase Two Tasks to be conducted during the June 13 - July 9, 2011 time frame after the contractor has certified they can complete ALL work during that time window. The vessel must be ready for service no later than July 9, 2011</p>
<p>NOAA employees may be working on board NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR R-6701 during the contract performance period on a not to interfere basis. During this period it will be required that NOAA Employees and NOAA contractors have full access to the NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR R-6701 during normal working hours.</p>
<p>Coordination of the work schedules will be the responsibility of the Contractor to avoid any delays or disruptions in order to meet the aforementioned performance period.</p>
<p>The following is general information:<br />Length overall: 67 feet <br />Beam: 24.5 feet<br />Draft: 6.1 feet<br />Displacement: 49 long tons <br />Construction: Aluminum</p>
<p>Upon arrival and the initial securing of mooring lines to the Contractor's dock, the contractor will accept full responsibility for the safety of the vessel (including but not limited to fire protection, watch-standing, security patrols, water-tight integrity, protection from the environment, etc.). This responsibility will terminate only after all work defined herein (or added during the work period) is complete, accepted by NOAA, and NOAA personnel remove the mooring lines from the Contractor's dock.</p>
<p>All work performed under this SOW will meet or exceed all current requirements of ABYC and USCG (Subchapter T) as applicable to this size and type of vessel, in addition to any specific requirements stated below.</p>
<p>B. PHASE ONE VESSEL ALONGSIDE WORK - SPECIFICATIONS/TASKS</p>
<p>1. Revise the head sole covering:<br />The head sole covering (Londeck #776) is lifting in places. Remove the existing covering material and adhesives completely (Lonseal #300 Epoxy Adhesive). Abrade the aluminum deck (head area only) surface to clean, bare metal. Install a ~&frac12;" high rounded lip under the head door to prevent water from leaving the space. Apply a coating of epoxy sealer to the entire deck surface, and over-coat this with nonskid paint equal to that on the exterior decks.</p>
<p>2. Revise the anchor rode:<br />With vessel captain or crew in attendance, inspect the anchor rode for a fair lay on the drum when stowed. Unspool the rode and reposition the connection between the &frac12;"wire rope and thimble to the 3/8"chain to alleviate any unfair lay on the drum. Rewind the rode completely and inspect to ensure proper placement of the connection. Repeat the steps above if required. (Images to be provided upon request).</p>
<p>3. Generator softpatch hatch revisions:<br />Remove the two hatches located over the generators, and clean all old sealant away. Remove deck paint from with 3" of each hatch opening on both the deck and the hatches. Weld a 3/16" x 2" aluminum flat bar flange around the perimeter of each hatch, using a continuous, non-oscillated watertight weld bead of ~1/8" throat thickness on upper and lower sides. Carry welds across miter-joints in the corners so the flanges are completely sealed to the hatches. Reinstall the hatches and weld the outer edge of the new flanges to the deck surface using the same weld criteria as above. NOTE: It is the intent that if these hatches have to be removed in the future, the weld bead on the deck will be cut with a saw. Therefore, the straightness and uniformity of the weld bead on the deck surface is important. Test all welds after completion to prove watertight integrity by inspection from below.</p>
<p>4. Install GFM galvanic isolator:<br />Install a GFM recessed galvanic isolator (Guest Amp) in the main cabin aft bulkhead as directed by the government's representative. Provide and install a shore power circuit breaker next to the galvanic isolator. Install the indicator panel for the galvanic isolator. Position the shore power circuit breaker and isolator panel on the forward side of the main cabin aft bulkhead so they are visible from the labs space. Test the galvanic isolator and breaker after installation to prove proper functioning. Clearly label the function of the breaker and indictor light.</p>
<p>ABYC Galvanic Isolator Installation Requirements:<br />&bull; 28.7.1 The galvanic isolator shall be connected in series with the shore power cable AC grounding conductor (green or green with yellow stripe) in a manner that no other ground conductor will bypass the isolator back to the shore power ground (see A-28 Figure 1).<br />&bull; NOTE: In some Community Antenna TV (CATV) systems, there is a possibility of bypassing the galvanic isolator through connection of additional CATV equipment (e.g., amplifier splitters, computer equipment, etc.). Additional isolation may be required on shielded connections.<br />&bull; 28.7.2 All AC power inlets and all telecommunication inlets (e.g., cable, phone, etc.) shall be electrically isolated from hull and deck, if conductive, and wired so that no part of the grounding system bypasses the isolator.<br />&bull; 28.7.3 The current rating of the galvanic isolator shall not be less than the rating of the main shore power disconnect circuit breaker as installed per ABYC E-11, AC &amp; DC Electrical Systems on Boats.<br />&bull; 28.7.4 The galvanic isolator shall be installed in a ventilated, dry and accessible location not to exceed the temperature rating of the unit.<br />&bull; 28.7.5 The status monitor shall be installed in an accessible location.<br />&bull; 28.7.6 Status monitor indicator(s) for the galvanic isolator shall be visible when operating the AC system.<br />&bull; 28.7.7 If the status monitor is installed in a location where it will be subjected to rain or spray the enclosure shall have a rating of IP64 or NEMA 4X.<br />&bull; 28.7.8 Conductor(s) shall be supported and/or clamped to relieve strain within six inches of the isolator</p>
<p>ABYC Shore Power Circuit Breaker Requirements:<br />&bull; 11.10.2.8.3 Additional Overcurrent Protection - If the location of the main shore power disconnect circuit breaker is in excess of 10 feet (three meters) from the shore power inlet or the electrical attachment point of a permanently installed shore power cord, additional fuses or circuit breakers shall be provided within 10 feet (three meters) of the inlet or attachment point to the electrical system of the boat. Measurement is made along the conductors. <br />&bull; 11.10.2.8.3.1 If fuses are used in addition to the main shore power disconnect circuit breaker, their rating shall be such that the circuit breakers trip before the fuses open the circuit, in the event of overload. The ampere rating of the additional fuses or circuit breaker shall not be greater than 125% of the rating of the main shore power disconnect circuit breaker. For 120-volt service, both the grounded and ungrounded current carrying conductors shall be provided with this additional over-current protection.</p>
<p>5. Revise RAM lights on mast:<br />The existing RAM lights (red, white, red) on the mast are blocked from view in certain quadrants. Install a second set of lights, identical to those existing, approximately 12" to 18" directly forward of the current set. Fabricate all brackets required to adequately support the new lights, and secure these brackets with mechanical fasteners or welds. Wire the new lights so they operate simultaneous with the existing set. Note that some of the existing RAM lights are on separate circuits, and the new lights must be wired the same. If required, upgrade the circuit breakers to handle the higher electrical load. Upon completion, test all lights to ensure proper visibility and function. (Images provided upon request).</p>
<p>6. Repair hydraulic leaks at reservoirs:<br />Drain tank, completely disassemble suction piping, replace MPT adapters installed in suction strainer and at pump end of line with JIC fittings of same internal diameter. Replace existing hose with similar hose with JIC swivel fittings on each end (one straight, one 90 degree). This will be a custom hose. Reassemble, use Loctite 545 at pipe threads. Assemble JIC threads dry or with copper flare inserts if fitting manufacturer recommends.</p>
<p>C. PHASE TWO VESSEL HAULED WORK - SPECIFICATIONS/TASKS</p>
<p>1. Drydock, cleaning, inspection, undock:<br />The vessel shall be lifted in a drydock; marine railway; or by travel lift rated for 60 tons or greater. The vessel shall be blocked without list or trim. The vessel shall not be lifted by a sling or crane which does not allow for even, vertical support of the entire vessel. There are strap marks indicated by orange triangles imprinted on the exterior vessel to mark lifting locations. See NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR R-6701 Drawing 800-001B "Docking Plan" to plan for lifting requirements.<br />1.1 Submittals<br />A. Signed by a qualified independent firm attesting that the drydock; travel-lift; or railway, and associated controls and machinery, are in good sound condition and have adequate capacity to safely drydock the vessel. The certification shall be based on a visual inspection of the facility within the 12-month period immediately preceding the scheduled drydocking, operating and maintenance records of the facility, and recent demonstration of the facility's capacity (e.g., record of the largest vessel drydocked during the preceding 6 months).<br />B. Provide a letter certifying that the Dock Master in charge of the docking and undocking evolutions is professionally qualified, through training and experience, to conduct the evolutions in a safe and reliable manner.<br />C. Prepare and submit a drydocking and undocking procedure which includes operating practices, special precautions that are required by the characteristics of the dock or vessel, depth of water, and tide and current conditions which will exist.<br />D. Provide a fire control plan that outlines the Contractor's ability to handle any fire or emergency without the use of any NOAA vessel systems. This shall include fire watch procedures. All hot work shall be approved 24 hours in advance by the government's representative. All spaced designated for hot work shall be certified to be safe for hot work by an independent marine chemist.<br />1.2 Preparations for Drydocking<br />A. Arrange the blocks in the Contractor's Facility; drydock; or railway in accordance with the ship's docking plan. Blocks shall be positioned to haul the vessel in the position specified in the detail specification item. In the event the detail specification item does not specify a docking position, the government's representative will specify the docking position.<br />B. The minimum height of keel blocks shall be as specified on the ship's docking plan or the detail specifications. In event a conflict exists between the docking plan and the detail specifications, the detail specifications take precedence. If not specified on docking plan or in the detail specifications, the minimum height shall be 36 inches. All keel blocks shall have 2 inches minimum soft wood caps.<br />C. Insure that all sea chests, discharges, transducers, domes, and other appurtenances are clear of all blocks. There shall be no obstructions between the floor surface of the drydocked location and the hull, hull openings, appendages, and fittings. Ample horizontal and vertical clearance shall be provided for removal and replacement of rudders, bow thrusters, fathometers, sea scanners, and sonar gear on the ship, whether or not such removals or replacement are known to be required.<br />D. Docking arrangements will be agreed upon during a pre-docking conference. This conference shall be attended by, as a minimum, government's representative, the Contractor or his/her Designated Representative; the Dock Master; and a NOAA Marine Engineer. This conference shall be arranged sufficiently prior to the docking date to permit the incorporation of all details required in the docking. Docking arrangements will be agreed upon during a pre-docking conference. <br />1.3 Docking Information<br />If requested, the government's representative will provide the Contractor with the following information gathered from the Vessel Operations Coordinator:<br />A. Place and date of last docking.<br />B. Last docking position.<br />C. Dates and file numbers of last two docking reports and interim docking reports (if any).<br />D. Number of days underway since last docking.<br />E. Paint history for last complete painting.<br />F. History of touch-up painting.<br />G. Tank sounding report.<br />H. List of any relevant data for any alterations accomplished on the vessel which may affect the docking operations but are not shown on the docking drawing.<br />I. Data for use in carrying out stability calculations from Ship's Damage Control Book and Booklet of General Plans.<br />1.4 Drydocking<br />A. After obtaining the consent of government's representatives, carefully haul-out the vessel without strain or injury, in a drydock; a travel lift; or marine railway. If any tendency to strain or injure the ship is observed, immediately re-float the vessel and rearrange the blocks/slings or make other corrections required to relieve the condition. <br />B. As the extremity of the vessel first to enter the dock reaches the dock sill, and the vessel is pointed fair for entering the drydock; marine rail; or vertical lift platform, the Contractor's Dock Master relieves the vessel's Operator in Charge of responsibility for the safety of the vessel. At this point, the Contractor's Dock Master also relieves NOAA of the operational control of the vessel.<br />C. Contractor's Dock Master shall center the vessel on the keel blocks, using centering bobs, sighting battens and other appropriate equipment. The vessel shall be kept centered over the keel blocks during the pumping down or raising operations. <br />D. Contractor's Dock Master shall direct the pumping out or lifting operations. It is mandatory to use divers during certain circumstances, such as when: <br />&bull; Docking drawing is in question;<br />&bull; Vessel is damaged;<br />&bull; Blocks are suspected of being damaged or moved during docking;<br />&bull; Contractor's adherence to the docking drawing is in question.<br />E. Shores, when used, shall be placed in position only after the vessel has landed fore and aft, but prior to the vessel reaching its draft at instability. Should a shore buckle, the Contractor's Dock Master shall stop pumping or raising operations, set up the next shore, and replace the buckled shore. <br />F. Contractor's Dock Master shall note the drafts on the vessel and observe that the vessel lands at the proper points with respect to the draft. Record the fore and aft draft mark readings of the vessel prior to drydocking and after undocking.<br />G. The Contractor's Dock Master shall stop the drydock pumps or raising of the vertical lift platform, and, if necessary, re-flood the dock or lower the platform in case:<br />&bull; The ship takes an undue list when landing;<br />&bull; The ship lands before the water has dropped to the proper depth;<br />&bull; A shore buckles (buckled shores shall be replaced);<br />&bull; government's representative observes any unsafe operations or operations that may endanger the vessel. <br />H. Installation of gangways and service lines shall be deferred until after the vessel has landed and side blocks are in position. If a gangway is needed promptly, it may be suspended by a crane during the pumping down or raising operations. Service lines shall be promptly installed after the vessel has landed and side blocks are in position. The Contractor shall provide the mooring lines, government owned mooring lines are not to be used.<br />I. As soon as possible, after the vessel has landed and side blocks are in position, a grounding cable or grounding strap shall be attached between the vessel and dock to protect the ship from the effects of electric storms and welding.<br />J. The government's representative or his/her Representative and the Contractor's Dock Master shall remain on site until the dock is pumped out sufficiently to permit personal examination of all blocks. Any irregularities found shall be corrected and any necessary shoring shall be placed before the government's representative and the Contractor's Dock Master leave the dock or the vertical lift facility until the facility is raised sufficiently to permit personal examination of all blocks and correction of any irregularities found. In all such cases, the docking crew shall likewise remain at the facility to assist as needed. The dock basin shall be washed down to remove silt, mud, and debris immediately after the vessel is drydocked.<br />1.5 Action After Docking<br />A. As soon as practical, but in all cases within 2 hours after drydocking the vessel, clean the entire underwater hull and boot-topping shall be cleaned of marine growth, dirt, and loose paint using stiff brushes, scrapers, and high pressure (minimum of 3000psi) fresh water. Included shall be sea strainer plates, sea chests, bow thrusters, rudders, propellers, shafts, struts, and other underwater hull appendages.<br />B. Exercise extreme care to avoid scratching, gouging or otherwise damaging any transducers, dome windows, shaft coverings or other appendages.<br />C. Clean transducers using non-metallic, non-abrasive brushes. Do not use scrapers on transducers.<br />D. Within 24 hours after drydocking, remove all sea chest covers, strainer plates, rope guards, and fairwaters. After completion of all inspections and acceptance of inspection condition reports by the government's representative, reinstall the items removed.<br />E. Provide adequate staging, or other safe means acceptable to the government's representative to accomplish all contract work and to permit a thorough inspection (see below) of the underwater body.<br />F. Clean all anodes with a non-ferrous wire brush to remove all corrosion products.<br />1.6 Drydocking Inspection<br />A. Within 24 hours after drydocking, a joint inspection of the vessel's underwater hull shall be conducted by the Contractor, the government's representative. Submit a Condition Report of the inspection's findings within 48 hours of inspection. The inspection shall include the following:<br />B. Condition of the hull, particularly inspecting for evidence of structural damage and deterioration of plating, welds, and fasteners.<br />C. Condition of anodes and paint system.<br />D. The condition of propulsion shafts, propellers; sea chests; overboard discharge piping; foil; fins; transducers; and all other underwater hull appendages. Inspect for evidence of leaks, damage, and deterioration.<br />E. Remove the void plugs in underwater hull rub rails, rudders, struts, fairing plates, bilge keels, and other inaccessible underwater voids. As the plugs are removed, inspect for drainage of water from the voids. If water is present, advise the government's representative prior to proceeding. <br />1.7 Underbody Propulsion &amp; Rudder Inspection<br />A. Conduct a drydocking inspection of the propulsion shafts that includes the following:<br />&bull; Both propulsion shafts run-out using a calibrated dial indicator;<br />&bull; Both Propulsion shaft clearance measurements in the cutlass bearings in the strut and intermediate/hull bearings. These measurements are to be taken at the 90, 180, 270, and 360 degree positions using extended length feeler-gauges;<br />&bull; Rudders are to be inspected for excessive bearing wear and alignment. Bearing wear can be determined either by pull test measurements or by extended feeler-gauges. Rudder alignment is measured from port to starboard rudder leading edges and port and starboard trailing edges. <br />B. All these measurements are to be presented in writing to the government's representative by the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) Marine Engineer.<br />1.8 Transducers<br />Clean, protect, and paint all transducers as follows:<br />A. Clean the exposed surfaces of each transducer while the surfaces are still damp. Clean transducers with non-metallic brushes. Do not use scrapers.<br />B. Degrease the faces of rubber-faced transducers with mineral spirits and rinse with fresh water. Do not use detergents on the rubber faces. Swab metallic-faced transducers with a solution of one part nitric acid to five parts fresh water, and follow with rich soapy water wash and fresh water rinse. Polish metallic-faced transducers with crocus cloth.<br />C. Coat all metallic-faced transducers with one coat of anti-fouling same as prescribed for the remainder of the underwater hull. This is to be accomplished by removing the plywood protective covers immediately prior to applying the last coat of paint to the underwater hull. All painting shall be in accordance with the paint manufacturer's printed recommendations and instructions.<br />D. NOAA reserves the right to inspect and adjust transducers.<br />E. Except when work is being performed on the transducer, cover the transducer faces with a plywood protective cover. Do not apply props or forced pressure on the face of the transducers.<br />1.9 Temporary Services <br />Contractor is to provide all labor, tools, and materials to provide electrical power and to ensure the overall security of the NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR R-6701. <br />A. The contractor shall provide all labor and materials to provide clean electrical power, 240VAC, Single Phase, 50 amp service.<br />B. The contractor shall provide security protection to prevent theft, vandalism, fires, flooding, collisions, and to ensure the vessel is properly stored and/or safely moored.<br />C. The contractor is to ensure that all welding leads, air hoses, debris/trash is removed from the vessel at the end of the work day.<br />1.10 Undocking <br />A. Prior to the commencement of undocking all debris, trash, and loose material shall be removed from the vessel. <br />B.

Carry welds across miter-joints in the corners so the flanges are completely sealed to the hatches. Reinstall the hatches and weld the outer edge of the new flanges to the deck surface using the same weld criteria as above. NOTE: It is the intent that if these hatches have to be removed in the future, the weld bead on the deck will be cut with a saw. Therefore, the straightness and uniformity of the weld bead on the deck surface is important. Test all welds after completion to prove watertight integrity by inspection from below.</p>
<p>6. Troubleshoot and repair bridge fathometer:<br />The existing Furuno BBFF1 &lsquo;black box'sounder for NavNet 1, does not consistently work in water deeper than 140m.

This problem may be indicative of a fault wither with the winch drum drive, the vessels hydraulic system, or with the winch controls. In either case, the contractor will determine the cause of this problem, and resolve it using the following process: <br />A] The contractor will assemble a temporary hydraulic control valve (rotary or linear handle) and jumper hoses to allow testing of the science winch underway while bypassing the existing control valve. The temporary valve will allow the same pressure and flow at the winch as the existing valve.<br />B] Prior to docking the vessel, the contractor will test the winch underway with the existing control valve under different loads and at different line speeds. The test will be repeated with the temporary valve, and any differences in performance (specifically the smoothness of operation when the automatic brake in applied) will be noted. NOAA personnel will operate the vessel and control the winch when underway. The contractor will provide, load aboard, and unload a selection of weights from 50# to the maximum rated capacity of the winch for test purposes.<br />C] The contractor will discuss the winches performance observed during step B above with the manufacturer, and attain their agreement on 1] additional trouble-shooting procedures, <br />and/or 2] resolution of the problem.<br />D] After determining the proper resolution, he contractor will revise, tune, or replace winch, control, or hydraulic system components to allow smooth winch drum operation at all rated loads at all rated speeds.<br />E] The contractor will test the winch after the vessel undocks and demonstrate correct operation of the winch. NOAA personnel will operate the vessel and control the winch when underway.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>**THIS WILL BE A LOCALLY-AWARDED CONTRACT (NON-FEDERAL)**<br /><br />AWARD WILL BE MADE BY THE TYGARTS VALLEY CONSERVATION DISTRICT</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>THIS PROJECT IS PARTIALLY FUNDED WITH FEDERAL USDA/NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE FUNDS.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>PROJECT INFORMATION:<br /></strong>The Shavers Fork Mitigation Project is a natural stream habitat-improvement project extending along 4.5 miles of the Upper Shavers Fork trout stream. The improvements will provide connectivity, habitat structure, and thermal refuge for fish using major tributaries for spawning habitat. Fish habitat improvements include narrowing the channel in select areas, enhancing the low flow channel (thalweg), adding rock and wood features to the stream, and enhancing pools.</p>
<p>The project site is located high in the mountains of Randolph and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia surrounded by the Monongahela National Forest. The Upper Shavers Fork Watershed is 60.2 square miles within one of the highest rainfall regions in the state receiving 60 inches of precipitation annually. The elevation ranges from 3500 to 3800 feet above sea level, which provides ideal growing conditions for the native Red Spruce trees. Strict adherence to pollution control measures is required.</p>
<p>The uppermost project site, at the confluence of Rocky Run, is 13 railroad miles from the primary staging location at Cheat Bridge. Transportation of all materials, equipment, and personnel to the project site must be via the railroad owned by the West Virginia State Rail Authority. The Tygarts Valley Conservation District has secured permission to use the railroad exclusively for this project for the portion of railroad track required to complete the work. There are no roads to the construction site, but the primary staging area is easily accessible from Highway 250. The primary staging area for the project is located 12.5 miles east of Huttonsville on Route 250. The primary staging area has been used for other railroad repair projects, but requires some improvements. The successful contractor must meet all requirements for operating on the state-owned railroad. Additionally, the contractor must provide all of the special equipment required to complete the project.</p>
<p>The construction season is from April 1 to November 30. Winter shutdown is from December 1 to March 31. Construction is expected to take three full construction seasons, but it is permissible and desirable to finish the project in less time.</p>
<p>The project includes various fish habitat improvements covering 4.5 miles of remote trout stream with the following major work items: clearing and grubbing; pollution control; seeding and mulching; mobilization; deepening/enhancement of 33 pools and 4,227 linear feet of thalweg (low flow) channel; earthfill for streambank shaping; 530 tons of rock riprap; quality control; 2,320 square yards of geotextile fabric; planting 1,100 red spruce seedlings and 722 other trees and shrubs; 21,190 live stakes and branch cuttings used for streambank restoration; 1,070 tons of crushed aggregate; 10,050 tons of rock for 14 boulder j-hook vanes, 2 boulder cross vanes, and 45 single wing rock deflectors; placement of 66 boulders for in-stream fish habitat; 65 large woody debris structures; 2,250 square yards of streambank restoration using reinforced earth, toe wood, and brush mattresses; 500 feet of silt fence; 3,560 feet of wattles for sediment barriers; 15,750 square feet of timber mat surfacing, and 3,476 square yards of erosion control blanket.<br />&emsp;<br /><strong>SOLICITATION INFORMATION:<br /></strong>The Tygarts Valley Conservation District located in Philippi, West Virginia will issue a Contract resulting from this solicitation. This is a Local Government project; however, it is partially funded with federal funding from the USDA/Natural Resources Conservation Service. The federal funding is part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Due to the use of ARRA funding, this solicitation includes some special contract requirements.</p>
<p>All on-site personnel from the successful bidder shall attend a safety class taught by the Durbin &amp; Greenbrier Valley Railroad, which will be arranged by the Tygarts Valley Conservation District. The class will cover unique safety requirements to the WV Central Railroad where the project is located.</p>
<p>The estimated cost range for the project is between $1 million and $4 million.</p>
<p><strong>A MANDATORY Pre-Bid Conference and Site Visit will be held at 8:00am (local time) on Thursday, April 21, 2011 at the Huttonsville Public Service District building located in Mill Creek, West Virginia.</strong> Huttonsville PSD is located on Route 219/92/55 across from the Helvetia-Adolph Road also known as County Route 46. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Failure to attend both the Pre-Bid Conference and Site Visit will result in rejection of your bid</span>. Representatives for Tygarts Valley Conservation District and Engineering will be present to discuss the Project. Participants are encouraged to pack a lunch and wear appropriate clothing for the site visit. Plan for a long day with an estimated return time of 6:00pm. Rail transportation will be provided by Tygarts Valley Conservation District.</p>
<p><strong>Bids packages shall be due Wednesday, JUNE 1, 2011 by 1:00pm (local</strong> <strong>time).</strong> Bids should be mailed or hand-delivered to the Tygarts Valley Conservation District Building located at Route 4, Box 501, Philippi, West Virginia. <strong>Bids will not be opened publicly on this date.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Bidders will be required to submit &nbsp;qualifications with their bid (See Instructions to Bidders Section- Article 3 of the solicitation).&nbsp; Tygarts Valley Conservation District will make&nbsp;award to the Contractor who meets all of the qualification requirements stated in Article 3 of the Instruction to Bidders&nbsp;and who has the lowest total bid price.<br /></strong></p>

<DESC>This modification to a previous synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce On Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). 

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue solicitation number N00024-11-R-4312 on a sole source basis to General Dynamics, Electric Boat Corporation, 75 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT 06340 for the New England Maintenance Manpower Initiative (NEMMI) non-nuclear submarine services.
 The level-of-effort contract will require direct labor, supervision, administrative support, to provide intermediate and depot level overhaul, repair and modernization services in support of operational nuclear powered submarines, floating dry-docks, support and service craft, and other submarine related platforms and equipment. 

This modification to a previous synopsis is being made to delineate the essential technical requirements for the performance of work under this contract. Essential to the performance of work under this contract is SUBSAFE certification. As a nuclear submarine builder, Electric Boat Corporation's workforce is trained to work on both nuclear and non-nuclear systems.
 Additionally, personnel are certified to work inside all designated nuclear spaces of submarines to perform non-nuclear maintenance actions, on a case-by-case basis, as required by NAVSEAINST 4350.2C and COMFLTFORCOMINST 4790.3. Much of the work performed in support of the Naval Submarine Support Facility (NSSF) is in the vicinity of nuclear and SUBSAFE work boundaries. Contractor personnel require a working knowledge of nuclear and SUBSAFE work boundaries, policies, and directives.

Work will be performed at the submarine base in New London, CT with occasional efforts at the company's shipyard in Groton, CT. The dynamics of submarine force operations require a NEMMI capable supplemental workforce comprised of Electric Boat employees located at NSSF, New London, CT, to accomplish operational submarine maintenance, repair and modifications to maintain fleet readiness and operational commitments.
 This requires a NEMMI contractor to maintain a staff in close proximity to SUBASE, New London. The contractor must be capable of providing the necessary mix of personnel in a rapid timeframe. Electric Boat Corporation is the only SUBSAFE certified activity in the New London, CT area capable of meeting the NEMMI requirements as delineated above. See Numbered Note 22.

The systems shall conform to the technical requirements called out in the Product Descriptions that will be provided with the solicitation. Vendors proposed configurations shall be uniform for the entire quantity of systems to be provided (i.e., entire quantity of each system shall be of the same configuration, model, and country of origin).

<DESC>I.  The following questions and answers are provided for information purposes under this Request for Information (RFI).  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).   Should an RFP or draft RFP be issued, it may contain terms and conditions that differ from the answers provided below:

Q1. Can this assembly and distribution project be performed in any state or is there a specific area of the US that is recommended or required?
A1.  There is no recommended, suggested, or required geographical location for the services contemplated as long as all applicable laws, regulations, and policies are addressed. The Government does not intend to provide facilities to support this effort.

Q2.  Is there a recommended, suggested or required geographical (US, state, city) location for the warehousing and services that are requested?
A2.
  See A1 above. 

Q3.	Will there be a requirement that any or all of the Medical Products be stored in air-conditioned or refrigerated space and if so, what are the temperatures required?
A3.  	There is a requirement to maintain items according to manufacturers directions to protect the efficacy and service life. Temperature ranges vary according to item. Please refer to Attachment 1 to the RFI Announcement for item listings.

Q4. Do some of the inventory items require specific temperature zones for storage and distribution and if so, what is the temperature range?
A4.  See A3 above.

Q5.  Will there be any receiving, shipping (units, cases) or estimated space required data that will be available for this Solicitation?
A5.
 The Government will provide space, cube, and weight estimates with the anticipated Draft RFP materials. The Government anticipates the necessity of some Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) as the Marine Corps has specific packaging requirements.

Q6.  Will there be a term agreement, 1, 2, 3, 5, year contract?
A6.  Response: Per the RFI announcement, MCSC anticipates that this Concept Pilot effort is a multiple year effort, potentially one base year plus two option years. The Government invites suggestions as to the most effective period of performance for the potential enterprise-wide rollout of the piloted solution.

Q7. Regarding the outbound distribution: Will this be performed by military, contracted non-military or, FEDEX, UPS, USPS?
A7.
  During the Concept Pilot, the Government anticipates that the service provider will be responsible for transportation of goods from its location(s) to any one of the USMCs Medical Logistics Company locations. MEDLOGS are at the following locations: Camp Pendleton, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; MCB Kaneohe Bay, HI; Camp Lejeune, NC; Newport News, VA; Camp Kinser, Okinawa. Until delivery/acceptance at the Medical Logistics Companys dock, the service provider has custody of the inventory, is responsible for the GFE, and owns the non-GFE line items.


II. The following information is provided regarding sterilization:

Sterilization of surgical instrumentation issued in AMALs/ADALs is performed by the Medical Logistics Companies  and is completed at regular intervals by a Surgical Instrument Technologist.
 All surgical gear issued to deploying units is to be handled in accordance to AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation) and AORN (Association of periOperative Registered Nurses) surgical sterility regulations. Surgical instruments must be prepared, organized, and packed in surgical sets in accordance to AMAL/ADAL configurations.  The Government anticipates that this sterilization function will be performed by the service provider using qualified sterilization personnel.  Qualified sterilization personnel are likely to be surgical instrument technicians who are aware of OSHA/AAMI/AORN regulations and recommended practices. No government-furnished sterilization equipment is available for this effort.

III.
  Non-GFE Medical Equipment and Supplies

The 3PL provider will be responsible for furnishing the required non-GFE medical equipment and supplies via its own existing relationships with medical equipment/supply providers, not through established Government medical supply contracts such as DLA or PM CSE Prime vendor contracts. The Government seeks to leverage the 3PLs supply chain relationships in order to maximize buying power, minimize inventory levels, and improve operational readiness.

IV.  Industry Day

The Government plans to conduct an Industry Event at Camp Lejeune, NC, on 24-25 May 2011. 

A limited number of individual sessions can be arranged with the MCSC team by appointment to discuss company qualifications and any suggested best practice information.
 Individual sessions will not exceed 30 minutes each and will be conducted on 25 May 2011.

Participation for the Industry Event and the individual sessions is limited and registration will be on a first come, first served basis. 

Please register your intent to participate with Mr. Mark Sanderson at mark.sanderson@usmc.mil, no later than 04 May 2011.  Also indicate whether you are requesting an individual session.  Further details regarding the Industry Event will be distributed as they become available.

See attachment for Live Meeting Information and links.

Clarification to Change published Apr 13, 2011 at 10:56 am on FBO to the RFI regarding Section III, Non-GFE Medical Equipment and Supplies: The Government has mandatory sources of supply for some of its medical equipment and supplies (e.g., DLA Prime Vendor Program, etc.).
 In the event that the required item is available through the Governments mandatory source(s) of supply, the Government will coordinate the procurement and delivery to the Service Provider as Government Furnished Equipment or Government Furnished Material (GFE or GFM). In the event that the item is not available from the Governments mandatory source(s) of supply, the Service Provider will be responsible for furnishing the required item via its own supply chain. The Government seeks to leverage the Service Providers supply chain relationships in order to maximize buying power, minimize inventory levels, and improve operational readiness.

<DESC>Three innovations under this contract will address the challenge of developingfuture space systems via fractionated architectures wherein wirelessly networked modulescommunicate, collaborate and share resources to accomplish the mission. The work beingconducted under this contract addresses cluster flight and will investigate how to designGN&C systems that are service-based and are part of a fractioned space system. Under thiscontract Emergent will develop a fractionated architecture and algorithms that reliablyand accurately estimate relative PVT for an indefinite number of satellites by acceptinga variable number of measurement types, rates, and accuracies and develop a framework andthe algorithms capable of implementing the constraints and objectives for all F6 clusterflight maneuver planning use cases. This work will also implement algorithm scalabilitywith changing cluster processing resources and competing cluster flight maneuver planningpriorities.
