<DESC>Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY) &amp; Fleet Readiness Center Western Pacific (FRCWP), in support of NAVAIR's Program Manager Aviation (PMA) 207, is seeking interested contractors with significant KC-130J experience to provide scheduled and unscheduled Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services for U.S. Marine Corps KC-130J aircraft forward deployed to the Western Pacific region. The place of performance will be in facilities proposed by the Contractor that meet the requirements of the contract.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The government's range requirements for the place of performance are not yet defined and we are open to industry feedback. The prior solicitation, N62649-14-R-0089, required the place of performance to be within 2,600 nautical miles of MCAS Iwakuni, Japan.</span>&nbsp; If approved, the government is considering potential for&nbsp;more than 4 option years.<br /><br />The incumbent contractor is AIROD SDN BHD (CAGE Y5029).&nbsp; The existing contract is currently performed in the contractor's facilities in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.<br />
<p><br />Contractor MRO support will include the following:</p>
<p>1) Depot Level Maintenance<br />Depot level maintenance (also known as Heavy Maintenance) tasks/actions are those requiring major overhaul or complete rebuilding, remanufacturing, or modification of aircraft structures, parts, assemblies, and end items, including support equipment in accordance with the Integrated Maintenance Plan (IMP) Specification and other applicable maintenance manuals.</p>
<p>2) Planned Maintenance Interval (PMI) work under IMP<br />IMP requirements provide for airframe, systems and component inspection (through visual and Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) methods), defect correction, preventative maintenance, operational checkouts and Technical Directive compliance.</p>
<p>The IMP requirements for aircraft subject to this process are the minimum requirements, formulated and established to the depth required to ensure the reliability, operational availability, safe operation and airworthiness of the aircraft for the duration of the established service period. The IMP Program will provide depot support throughout the total service life of the aircraft.</p>
<p>a. PMI events for KC-130J will be based on the latest NAVAIR Specification.</p>
<p>b. The estimated Aircraft throughput is 4 aircraft per year. However, the contract type will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) and will not guarantee either the quantity or frequency of aircraft inductions.</p>
<p>c. It is anticipated that the Contractor shall be capable of supporting a nominal workload of 1 aircraft in flow, with a surge capacity to 3 aircraft in flow.</p>
<p>d. Aircraft inducted for PMI will be flown to the contractor's facility.</p>
<p>3) In-Service Repairs (ISR)<br />Unscheduled maintenance requirements are those requirements, (typically identified as Depot Level Maintenance), which cannot be directly related to any scheduled requirement described herein and which are discovered as an incidental result of the following functions accomplished as a part of and during the scheduled inspection, and during squadron operational use.</p>
<p>a. ISR repairs are expected to be completed either concurrently with PMI events or as standalone actions.</p>
<p>b. ISR repairs may require the Contractor to dispatch personnel as a contractor field service team (CFT) to perform aircraft ISR throughout the east Pacific region, and other areas as required, without impacting PMI event turn-around times (TAT).</p>
<p>4) Aircraft Modifications <br />a. Aircraft modifications (e.g. technical directives, airframe changes, etc.) shall be accomplished either concurrently with PMI events or as standalone actions.</p>
<p>b. The Government will provide the technical data and material required for completing modifications.</p>
<p>5) Customer Service<br />Customer Service requirements include Squadron Operational Level maintenance tasks performed concurrent with PMI activities when approved by the Government.</p>
<p>6) Engineering Support<br />Engineering services, necessary to support the requirements of the contract, including submittal of repair procedures to be reviewed and approved by the Government.</p>
<p>7) Logistics Support<br />Logistics services necessary to support the requirements of the contract, including timely supply data and material requisition requests necessary for completing aircraft maintenance requirements within the established TAT. The government will provide or directly fund procurement of all material.</p>
<p>8) Program Management Support<br />Program Management necessary to support the requirements of the contract, including annual Program Management Reviews (PMR), weekly production meetings, Production Plans that identify the critical path to PMI completion within the established TAT.</p>
<p>Interested companies are asked to respond to this notice by submitting the following information to the Contracting Officer via email: kurt.dronenburg@fe.navy.mil. Please also include any questions or comments related to the requirements described above:</p>
<p>(1) Company name, point of contact, telephone numbers, e-mail address, company CAGE Code, and DUNS</p>
<p>(2) Approximate annual gross revenue for the past 5 years (if available).</p>
<p>(3) Description of the company's ability to mobilize, manage and finance a contract of this size.</p>
<p>(4) Description of Government or commercial contracts for work on identical Type/Model/Series (T/M/S) aircraft (both as prime and sub-contractor)*</p>
<p>(5) If you do not have any past or current work on identical T/M/S aircraft, please describe Government or commercial contracts for similar work (either as prime or sub-contractor)*</p>
<p>(6) Description of your workforce skill-sets performing similar or identical T/M/S work.</p>
<p>(7) Description of your facilities used to perform similar or identical work.<br /><br />*Please include details such as production volume, levels of maintenance performed (organizational, intermediate, or depot), facility attributes, owned tooling / equipment, workforce size and employed labor categories, etc. that demonstrate your ability to perform the work.</p>
<p>The Government is under no obligation to consider information received after the required due date as part of the formal market research for this acquisition.</p>
<p><br />Please also note that FRCWP is considering an Industry Day in support of this requirement to be held at Naval Air Facility Atsugi during April-May 2018.
