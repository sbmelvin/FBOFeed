Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Background:<br />Currently Marines mount a variety of electronic lights, lasers and optics on their weapons, along with radios on their body armor. Controlling the functionality of these items often requires Marines to remove a hand from their weapon to manipulate each device individually or to utilize a single item controller or pressure switch. The USMC desires a single device, which attaches to the weapon that can control multiple electronic items.<br /><br />Contract Capabilities to be Awarded:<br />A control device which mounts on the MIL-STD-1913 rail and/or STANAG 4694 NATO Accessory Rail on the M4 &amp; M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle. Device includes illuminator/laser pointer, thermal weapon sight, image intensifier weapon sight, tactical radio, and tactical headset.<br />The device must include the following capabilities:<br />1.

Image intensifier weapon sight<br />d.	Tactical radio <br />e.	Tactical headset <br />Note:  A controller/pressure switch that only controls a single item does not meet the desired capability.<br />3.	The control device shall control electronic items from multiple manufacturers.<br />4.	The control device shall connect to items using wires or wirelessly.<br />5.	The control device can be operated without changing hand placement on the weapon.<br />6.	The control device must be able to operate while the user is wearing gloves.<br />7.	The control device must not interfere with the operation of the weapon.<br />8.	The control device must be rugged and able to handle the shock from repeated weapon firings and high temperature from a hot barrel.<br /><br />Contract Estimated Award Date:December 2, 2016
<p>Justification for Award Using Other than Full and Open Competition:<br />This Award will be placed under the authority FAR 6.302-1: Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The action shall be awarded in support of the US Congressionally approved Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program. The procurement is intended to award a sole source contract to KORD Defence for a Rifle Interface Control (RIC) to meet the United States Marine Corp (USMC) requirement. <br />Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 206.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements", paragraph (b) "Application. This authority may be used for acquisitions of test articles and associated support services from a designated foreign source under the DoD Foreign Comparative Testing Program." DFARS 206.302-1(b).

<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification for additional work without providing for full and open competition to Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, 320 E. North Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15212-4756 for "A Study to Explore the Feasibility of using Combined Modalities to Test the Safety of the CardioMEMS Device in PAH Patients."</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541712 with a Size Standard of 500.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY<br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-89.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 15-contracting by Negotiations at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p>STATUTORY AUTHORITY<br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>Background<br />Although there are now therapeutic options that improve long-term outcomes, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains fatal. Thus, there is a need not only for further investigations to provide new targets for therapeutics, but there is an overriding need for better surrogate markers for outcome prediction and monitoring of treatment efficacy in order to improve survival and quality of life for these patients. This contract provided valuable insight into both of these clinical needs by creating and testing several novel and dynamic prognostication tools, which combined ambulatory in vivo hemodynamic monitoring using the CardioMEMs device<sup>TM</sup> with cardiac MRI technology coupled with a unique integrative learning software that has both potential applications for research and clinical practice. Four unique innovations arose out of this Stage A of the VITA contract: 1) The first use of the implantable CardioMEMs&reg; ambulatory hemodynamic sensor in PAH to monitor disease progress 2) The first combined use of the CardioMEMs&reg; sensor with cardiac MRI to develop a unique right ventricular-pulmonary arterial coupling element 3) The first use in PAH patients of the CardioMEMs sensor to obtain real time exercise hemodynamics 4) The testing of a unique machine leaning software, ALiE, to decipher patterns real time in longitudinal hemodynamic data and other prognostic variables, which may predict outcome in PAH. It is our hope that these innovations will serve as superior surrogate markers for outcome prediction and monitoring of treatment efficacy that will lead to an improvement survival and quality of life for our patients.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />Purpose is to extend the funded research entitled "A Study to Explore the Feasibility of using Combined Modalities to Test the Safety of the CardioMEMS Device in PAH Patients," contract number HHSN268201400008C, and funded under Vascular Interventions/Innovations and Therapeutic Advances (VITA) Stage A, BAA-NHLBI-CSB-HV-2013-02-JS. This extension is needed as the current revised enrollment criteria is under DSMB and IRB review which may take a few months to complete the review and revision process. In order to complete the last 3 patients' enrollment, the investigator requested an extension to complete the current proposed project after receiving the IRB and DMSB approval.</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />This will be a cost- reimbursement option period with a period of performance from December 1, 2016 through May 31, 2017.<br /><br />Project Description<br />The purpose of this extension is to 1) Continue to collect data on the 17 previously implanted patients; and, 2) To allow the implantation of the last 2-3 consented patients with at least a 6 month follow-up for safety and functional assessments.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br />This requirement was initially posted as a BAA and therefore, a sources sought notice was not required as the purpose for using this mechanism was to promote and broaden competition and research. As this added work is a continuation of an existing contract funded under the BAA, further market research will not be conducted.</p>
<p>CLOSING STATEMENT<br />This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.

Government intends to solicit for the repair of (1) items: QTY 1 EA, P/N 2012D-100, NIIN: 015290847, NOM: Shock Strut Assembly. The government does not possess (or cannot provide) the data necessary to perform the required repairs or manufacture of the item.

The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.
https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps 
This brochure identifies the technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data 
required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet 
Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT ACTION
Software and Training Material Development in support of Executable Architecture Management System (ExAMS)
The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of Chief of Engineering (CHENG) Code 5.0 intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Metron, Inc., Scientific Solutions Division, located at 1818 Library Street, Suite 600, Reston, VA 20190-5631 for systems engineering, software design, software development, integration, testing, installation, training, life cycle maintenance, management support, and system documentation for ExAMS.  The requirement is currently being fulfilled under Metron task order N00178-06-D-4812-NS02.
The prospective award is based on the authority for other than full and open competition found at 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Metron is the contractor that currently possesses all developmental and operational knowledge.  The required efforts cannot be performed by any other source other than Metron without substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
Solicitation N00039-17-R-0021 is anticipated to be issued and subsequently awarded in Fiscal Year 2017.  The prospective award is planned to be Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contract with a three year period of performance (one-year base and two one-year options).
The Government is not soliciting proposals in response to this synopsis. However, in an effort to foster competition, any prospective offeror may provide relevant information, by the requested due date below, which the Government may consider in its continued review of the sole source nature of this requirement.

<DESC>Request for Information<br />"Veterinary Training Initiative"<br />Synopsis:<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This notice is for MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY, and in no way obligates the United States Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise make a contract award. This notice is open to all interested parties.
<p>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) intends to establish and support a veterinarian training program pilot initiative to deliver training modules designed to support differential diagnosis of infectious diseases related to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) list of Select Agents and Toxins via a distance learning platform for veterinarians and other animal health care professionals or paraprofessionals in CBEP partner countries. This RFI is being issued to determine if there are qualified sources.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>DTRA/CBEP aims to restructure its training program according to a measurable, goal-oriented framework that utilizes internationally recognizable, peer reviewed, and evidence based technical content.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />COOPERATIVE BIOLOGICAL ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM<br />EPIDEMIOLOGY DISTANCE LEARNING
<p>Synopsis: <br />This is a Sources Sought Notice/Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This notice is for MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY, and in no way obligates the United States Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise make a contract award. The RFI responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposals, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the grants.gov website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) has historically provided epidemiology training to its partner countries in order to enhance capacity and capability to detect, analyze, and report pathogens of security concern. Training has been provided in various formats; however, at this time, CBEP is looking to provide a more sustainable approach to training. Distance learning will provide a more sustainable continuous training option for a country because it will eliminate the need for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and United States Strategic Command Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (DTRA/SCC-WMD) to send in trainers to support specific cohorts over a pre-determined period of time. Distance learning may result in a more sustainable approach to outside training for the partner countries and may build capacity to eventually develop and institutionalize their own training programs. Moreover, distance learning is a viable option for those instances when sending trainers to a country is not feasible due to security risks, high costs, and other challenges of hosting training events. <br />Purpose and Objectives:<br />The objective of this RFI is to identify interested sources capable of developing distance learning training courses and a sustainable platform to share the courses with CBEP partner countries, including, but not limited to Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. Distance learning courses developed should provide a scalable and tailorable solution to epidemiology training in settings where continuous, sustainable training is needed. <br />The following list includes examples of the activities that are considered for inclusion in this scope:<br />&bull; Collaborate with CBEP to create methodology for the development and implementation of epidemiology distance learning courses, to include the following: <br />o Identification of gaps in epidemiology workforce knowledge in collaboration with CBEP and its partners<br />o Use of known gaps to develop a training plan for distance learning <br />o Development of methodology to effectively implement distance learning training to multiple cohorts over a period of time<br />&bull; Develop distance learning courses in the following domains to be provided to trainees in CBEP partner countries, for example:<br />o Epidemiological Methods - candidates are capable of employing epidemiology methods to conduct descriptive and analytic studies<br />&#61607; Introduction to Epidemiology<br />&#61607; Infectious Disease Epidemiology <br />&#61607; Study Designs<br />&#61607; Introduction to Analysis of Epidemiological Data<br />&#61607; Advanced Analysis of Epidemiological Data<br />&#61607; Computer Technology for Data Analysis and Visualization, etc. <br />o Biostatistics - candidates are capable of using biostatistics methods to examine epidemiological data<br />&#61607; Introduction to Statistics<br />&#61607; Introduction to Data Presentation<br />&#61607; Measures of Disease Frequency and Association <br />&#61607; Hypothesis Testing, etc.<br />o Public Health Surveillance - candidates understand all relevant components of a public health surveillance system and how to take part in and manage a surveillance system <br />&#61607; Introduction to Surveillance Systems<br />&#61607; Epidemiological Methods in Surveillance Systems<br />&#61607; Surveillance System Reporting and Communications<br />&#61607; Reporting to International Organizations, etc.<br />o Epidemiology of Priority Diseases - candidates have a strong working knowledge of priority diseases within their country and are familiar with the epidemiological, clinical, and diagnostic aspects of these diseases<br />&#61607; Disease-Specific Courses, as appropriate<br />&bull; Provide a certificate of course or course-series completion <br />&bull; Develop exercises and/or field work options that can be provided to ensure that course material has been retained<br />&bull; Maintain records of course attendance and completion<br />&bull; Provide course material in both online and offline formats (for trainees without stable internet access)<br />&bull; Translate course material into the primary language of the partner countries (to be specified) <br />&bull; Assist the partner country in institutionalizing the training material to facilitate sustainability of training<br />Response Requirements: <br />Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper. Responses shall be three-five pages including diagrams. Pages not included in the total page count are the cover page, the cover letter and the table of contents.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions:</p>
<p>Responses shall be in Microsoft Word for Office 2007 compatible format, limited to three-five 8x11 pages, and shall:</p>
<p>&bull; Confirm source's ability and interest to meet purpose and objectives provided;<br />&bull; Identify any aspects of the requirements stated that cannot be met and any issues/concerns with the requirements as stated;<br />&bull; Assess whether purpose and objectives can be accomplished within 36 months, or provide a realistic alternative timeframe for completion;<br />&bull; Provide any information on past work on epidemiology course development and/or distance learning course development;<br />&bull; Provide a brief description on the capabilities and functionalities, as well as the hosting architecture used for distance learning courses;<br />&bull; Provide any information on any past work in training international cohorts on topics in public health; <br />&bull; Provide information on any existing business relationships that your company has with government personnel in the target countries that could be used to leverage buy-in from key stakeholders</p>

<DESC>Description<br /><br />Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research for the investigation, control and prevention of diseases caused by all infectious agents other than HIV. Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).<br />The development and introduction of new therapeutic products against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID established the Preclinical Development of Interventional Agents program, a nontraditional, proactive, and product development-oriented program to provide preclinical product development support for promising therapeutic candidates for human infectious diseases or diseases caused by infectious agents. The purpose of this solicitation is to recompete this program and include services supportive of new diagnostics for infectious disease-causing pathogens and/or toxins.<br />The suite of services included in this contract will encompass those activities commonly associated with the development of interventional agents for treating or diagnosing infectious disease that are required for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and/or Biologic License Application (BLA). These services are available for therapeutic candidates arising from academia, the private sector or other sources. While the overall suite of services provided is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of therapeutic product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway. These services are intended to help a wide variety of investigators in a number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I/II trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter a Phase I trial. Furthermore, the rapid diagnosis of infectious disease-causing pathogens and/or toxins is crucial for implementing proper treatment and patient management. The commercial development of new diagnostics is a high priority. For that purpose, this solicitation includes services supportive of new diagnostics for infectious disease-causing pathogens and/or toxins.<br />DMID anticipates awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to the organizations that best meet the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of the Task Areas of this solicitation, which include:<br />&bull; Task Area A - Product Development Planning and Evaluation<br />Task Area B- Lead Identification Development, Chemistry and Synthesis Services<br />Task Area C- Chemistry and Manufacturing Services<br />Task Area D- Pre-Clinical Microbiological, Safety, Toxicology, and Pharmacokinetics Services<br />Task Area E- Lead Optimization Screening Assays for ADME, Safety and PK Properties<br />&bull; Task Area F - Parent Contract Management Support Activities<br />Contracts are anticipated to organizations proposing the full suite of services and also to organizations proposing two or more of the Task Areas.<br />For the purposes of this contract, the following definitions apply:<br />&bull; Interventional Agent or Product - Therapeutic or diagnostic for the treatment or diagnosis of an infectious disease caused by a pathogen or certain toxins (e.g., botulinum toxin).<br />&bull; Therapeutic - A product intended for use in the cure, mitigation or treatment of disease caused by a pathogen or certain toxins, e.g., botulinum toxin.<br />&bull; Diagnostic - A product intended for use to determine the disease or condition causing a patient's signs and symptoms<br />The NIAID recognizes that a single organization or institution may not have the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in the Statement of Work. Contractors shall perform the work described in two or more Task Areas. Contractors may need to be supported to a certain extent by the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. However, contractors shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.

<DESC>The LCI group requires the use of the instruments to do bioanalytical and proteomic assays of plasma samples in the lab. The service agreement will allow the LCI group to maintain equipment as well as prevent breakdowns.
<p><br />This equipment is heavily used and there are many bioanalytical and proteomic assays that are dependent on the proper functioning of the instruments. Also, if they break down and are out of warranty, the costs for repair would be very high and would require a significant downtime for repair of these instruments, which would hamper the research as the assays typically run on these instruments and cannot be run on any other instrument.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. <br /><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources, (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong><br />The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research, a consortium of 15 NIH Institutes and Centers that support neuroscience research, established the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) as a pipeline between the typical endpoint of NIH-funded research and the beginning of industry drug development. The BPN provides neuroscience researchers with funding and access to a full range of industry-style drug discovery and development services and expertise.</p>
<p>The BPN program is intended for projects requiring medicinal chemistry optimization and CRO support through phase I clinical testing. Each project is directed by a Lead Development Team composed of the principal investigator, industry consultants hired by NIH, and NIH staff. This team maps out a research strategy, including milestones, and oversees implementation by contract research providers. Bioactivity and efficacy studies are funded through an award to the principal investigator; other research services are provided without cost to the PI through NIH contracts.</p>

<RESPDATE>120216
<CONTACT>Elizabeth K. Glasgow, Phone 9783188671, Email elizabeth.k.glasgow@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is conducting a market survey for Maintenance and Repairs to the East Jetty feature of the Federal project and for Maintenance Dredging of a portion of the authorized 6 foot deep Entrance Channel in Green Harbor in Marshfield, Massachusetts. This announcement is to determine the interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned and Small Business concerns as described below. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The project is planned to be issued on or about January 25, 2017. The construction will occur in the spring 2017 and is expected to take several months. The construction window for the dredging portion of the project is April 16, 2017 through May 31, 2017. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.
<p>The work of this project consists of repairing a 150 foot section of the east jetty at Green Harbor. The east jetty was damaged during Winter Storm Juno in 2015 and subsequent storms. Approximately 1,200 tons of new armor stone will be required to make repairs to the landward section of the jetty. The new armor stones will vary in size from 4-7 tons. The work includes excavating, removing, stockpiling, installing and reworking existing armor stone as well as acquiring and installing new armor in the jetty repair areas. The repaired areas must be properly interlocked and be within specified design tolerances. The excavation and stone placement may be performed from land or water; however, new armor stones will need to be delivered via waterborne plant. Additionally, the project consists of maintenance dredging of approximately a 600' long section of the 6 foot deep entrance channel and side-slope at the "Narrows" where the entrance channel meets the inner harbor area. Approximately 24,000 cubic yards of sand and cobbles will need to be removed. The dredged material will be placed in a scow and towed to a nearshore placement area approximately 1 mile from the harbor and offshore of Green Harbor Beach.</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following: business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) and what type of equipment the firm is proposing to use. Firms must submit documented information that demonstrates experience with a minimum of two examples of construction projects, similar in scope and magnitude to this project that the firm has successfully performed in the last five years. The examples must clearly demonstrate breakwater or jetty repair projects (or other stone work in a marine environment) beyond typical earthwork construction and demonstrate experience with acquiring and placing large armor stones (up to 10 tons) with both land and marine equipment; the ability and capability of simultaneously performing this work by land and barge; demonstrate experience in working in a dynamic and restricted marine environment (ocean waves, tides, time of year, etc.); and by demonstrating the ability to perform dredging in a tidally-influenced environment via mechanical dredge plant and the ability to haul to, and place the dredged material at, an exposed ocean placement site. Responses should include experience of Foreman and Crane Operators working on stone structures. Please indicate your team subcontractors that will be used to support your effort and include their prior experience and qualifications. Proof of bonding capability is required. Responses are due December 2, 2016. Responses should provide one electronic CD format and one hard copy.

STATEMENT OF WORK
CONTRACT EMERGENCY RESIDENTIAL SERVICES BEDS: GENERAL POPULATIONS FY17

PURPOSE. 

The Minneapolis Veteran Affairs Health Care System (MVAHCS) requires Contractors to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient supportive services to meet their needs and ultimately facilitate the improvement of their housing situation. 

BACKGROUND.

Through the HCHV program, VA provides supportive services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain offers from Contractors in the Twin Cities who can provide housing, and supportive services to Homeless Veterans and/or their families in community-based Contracted Emergency Residential Services (CERS) facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their goals for recovery from homelessness.  The Contractor will be required to provide a low- barrier therapeutic and rehabilitative milieu and attendant services targeting the underlying factors contributing to homelessness.  The Contractor will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment. 

SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED

BASIC SERVICES: The Contractor shall furnish each Veteran who has been approved as eligible by the VA and admitted for care under this contract with the following basic services: 

ROOM AND BOARD: Room and Board shall be accessible to the Veteran 7 days a week and 24 hours per day.  Accommodations will include a bed and other furnishings such as a dresser, storage locker or designated secured space, and personal linens (towels, pillows, blankets and bed sheets, etc.). The Contractor will allow Veteran to store personal belongings for at least 72 hours after formal HCHV discharge. At least three nutritious meals, 7 days a week will be provided for the Veteran. In addition, there will be availability of snacks of nourishing quality (e.g. fruits, vegetables, protein sources, etc.), between meals and bedtime for those requiring or desiring additional food, even when it is not medically indicated.  There will not be more than a 14 hour span between evening meal and breakfast of the following day. Contractor will provide alternative meals for Veterans with dietary restrictions if medically indicated (e.g. diabetic, renal and soft mechanical diets) and reasonable accommodation for Veterans with cultural/religious preferences around food (e.g. Kosher, Sikh, etc.). Food shall be prepared, served and stored under sanitary conditions.  The facility shall provide storage space in an onsite refrigerator for Veterans to store and freely access personal food. The facility shall establish and maintain sanitary procedures for washing dishes, cleaning equipment and work areas, and disposing of waste. 

LAUNDRY FACILITIES: Laundry facilities and necessary detergent free of charge and adequate for residents to do their own laundry or to have laundry done at minimum one time per week.

THERAPEUTIC AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES: Each Veteran will have an Individual Care Plan (ICP) completed by the Contractor with input from the Veteran and the VA Homeless Program staff.  Therapeutic and rehabilitative services will be stated in the plan of care.  Services which the Contractor must be able to furnish or provide shall be detailed in the QASP and will include:

Group Activities: Structured group activities, as appropriate, shall occur two times per month   examples include group therapy, life skills training, social skills training, financial workshops, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, vocational counseling and physical activities as appropriate. For the purposes of this contract  House Meetings  and VA Housing Resource Groups may not be counted as a structured group activity should have a therapeutic value and facilitation shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. Should a Veteran have mental health, medical, family and/or employment obligations which directly conflicts with this requirement alternate group activates will be arranged and/or the Contractor will clearly document efforts made to accommodate the Veteran.
VA Coordination: Collaboration and coordination with VA program staff, as needed, will include coordination of supportive psychosocial services.  In particular, coordinated efforts must be made with the Liaison around medical, mental health, admission and discharge needs.
Case Management: A thorough written Individualized Care Plan (ICP) will be developed within 72 business hours of admission for each Veteran. This will include structured individual case management, at minimum, weekly including counseling on self-care skills, adaptive coping skills, financial planning, permanent housing search, written care plan, referral for financial benefits. Additional counseling may include, professional and vocational rehabilitation counseling in collaboration with VA programs and community resources. In addition, special attention will be made to address High Suicide Risk (HSR) Veterans as identified by the VA Liaison, VA Mental Health Staff and/or the contracted Case Manager. On a weekly basis the contracted case manager will be required to update the VA Liaison on Veteran progress and/or safety concerns for HSR Veterans. Contracted case manager will review the HSR Safety Plans with the Veteran on a bi-weekly basis. HSR Safety plan reviews and a copy of the Veteran s Safety Plan will be documented in the chart.  All Veterans will be referred to VA for Primary Care and Mental Health appointments and Contractors will support Veterans in making initial and subsequent appointments. Efforts will be documented in the Veterans ICP and reviewed by the HCHV Liaison at least monthly. All Contractors will provide proper documentation verifying services and case management efforts by all team members including, but not limited to housing, benefit and employment specialists, and program management staff. There will be an expectation that notes are written professionally in a format that utilizes the clear settings of goals and documents progress towards those goals (e.g. SNAP, SOAP, or SMART notes).
Staffing Ratio: Special Population Contracts (e.g. Sex Offenders, Family, SMI, Medical Respite programs, etc.) will maintain a minimum staffing requirement ratio of one full time dedicated case manager per 15 Veterans. All other programs are required to maintain low caseloads of no more than one full time dedicated Veteran case manager for up to 20 active Veteran clients. Exceptions may be granted in writing by the VA.  Staff is defined as a paid professional or para-professional and does not include interns. The VA requires that case managers working with Veterans do not engage in case management or group facilitation of  non-Veteran population unless a waiver has been granted by the VA. Each VA Liaison will have no more than two POC s per program. 
Permanent Housing Search: Programs are required to provide Veterans with direct and ongoing assistance in achieving permanent housing.  As a primary goal of the HCHV program, plans for Veterans  transition to permanent housing placements must be clearly reflected in each ICP and in weekly case management notes.  As part of this plan, Veterans  housing history and needs must be assessed through a formal and thorough Housing Assessment completed within 72 business hours of program admission. Housing Assessments must identify Veterans  housing history, strengths (i.e. positive prior rental history), and barriers (i.e. Unlawful Detainers).  Should Veteran refuse to engage with program staff regarding plans for permanent housing transition, motivational interviewing and other therapeutic techniques will be used to address Veteran ambivalence.  All efforts to engage Veteran regarding housing plans, options, and resources shall be clearly documented and include any therapeutic techniques utilized. Contractor staff must provide direct assistance to Veterans in developing permanent housing plans and accessing appropriate housing resources.  These services shall be provided weekly through one to one case management. Examples of expected housing services include: 1) assistance obtaining and reviewing Veteran s free credit report, identifying housing strengths and/or barriers associated with current credit status; 2) Creating a Tenant Portfolio with Veteran that contains all relevant documents required in the rental process, including a completed sample rental application for Veteran, income verification documents, identification, applicable subsidies, etc.; 3) Reviewing affordable housing rental options and Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) program offerings, and assisting Veterans with making appropriate rental inquiries and submitting completed rental applications; 4) Conducting regular and individualized housing advocacy efforts, including transportation, assistance scheduling, meeting, and communicating with property managers and landlords, and engage in troubleshooting where rental barriers or denials occur in the housing search process and 5) exploring housing options in low-rent areas.  All housing efforts by Contractor shall be documented clearly and presented to HCHV Liaison upon request.  Mere communication with Veterans regarding housing, without subsequent Contractor staff action and follow-up, shall not on its own meet the above requirements. Sex Offender programs will have increased focus on discharge to stable or permanent housing placements as evidenced in ICP and QASP.
Financial Planning: Referral to and follow up on all potential financial resources the Veteran may be eligible for (e.g. SSI, SSDI, Food Stamps, NSC pension, GA, etc.). Case Managers will document all structured activities that support Veteran in developing a short and long term plan to understand and address their current financial situation and how to improve it. Financial planning efforts may be accomplished in group but preferably through one on one case management services. At minimum four financial planning activities appropriate to the Veterans individual circumstance must be documented monthly.

 Occupancy:  It is expected that Contractor beds will be maintained at an average minimum of an 85% occupancy rate but at a preferred rate of 90% as calculated based upon number of bed nights available per quarter.   If this rate is not consistently attained a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) will be developed by the Contractor as part of the QASP and/or process improvement plan.  Adjustments in contract funding may occur through modifications if occupancy is not maintained.

Housing needs will be assessed upon acceptance to the program (within 72 business hours as noted in Paragraph 5) and resources will be coordinated for discharge to a successful community placement throughout the duration of the Veteran s stay.

All Veterans scheduled for discharge based on behavior must meet with the treatment team and work with team to determine most therapeutic option for Veteran.  This does not include violations for safety reasons or verbal abuse. Please note: Profanity does not in and of itself constitute abuse and shall not exclusively be considered grounds for discharge. Any and all actual or threatened violence will be grounds for discharge. Veterans may be discharged for safety reasons at any time. All negative discharges will be subject to a full team debriefing, including VA Liaison, to look for opportunities missed to intervene sooner. All discharges are subject to the Contractors grievance procedures and must allow clients the opportunity to be represented by the VA Liaison in the grievance process. Reasonable efforts must be made to coordinate with the Liaison in order to schedule an appeal. Lastly, all TQI measures must be met in order to receive the highest past performance rating.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7110-00-NIB-2413<br />Name:		Desk, Standing, Adjustable, Black, 36"<br />Description:	Two tiered, adjustable height standing desk is designed to accommodate dual-monitors or larger workspace requirements. The desk sits on top of an existing desk and has a 35 pound capacity. The desk is 36" wide and black. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Philadelphia, PA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7110-00-NIB-2413<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	7110-01-653-5901; 7110-01-653-7595; VCT DC350; Symmetry High Tide; ERG 33-341-200; ERG 33-349-200; HONS1102</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no adverse impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please visit http://abilityone.gov/distributors/potential.html for more information.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than December 2, 2017 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award without competition.  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) intends to award a fixed-price purchase under authority FAR Part 13.106-1(b), Simplified Acquisition procedures.  Due to the established Autofish tagging systems, only one source can provide this service.  Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC), Portland, OR will provide service for  Adipose Fin Clip and Tagging Service of the Chinook Salmon season beginning in December 2016.  The Autofish tagging systems being used in California are the property of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and are shared among all of the State and Federally operated hatcheries in the Central Valley. Because of the unique expertise required to operate the Autofish tagging systems, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife requires that PSMFC staff be the only contractor permitted to operate the Autofish systems. Marking/tagging fish using manual techniques would be the only alternative and would result in a significant increase in program cost while, at the same time, providing decreased precision and effectiveness.

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Zero-RK calculates the thermo-physical properties, reaction rate coefficients, production rates, and other derivatives of the chemically reacting system necessary to efficiently simulate the time evolution of species or thermodynamic state.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Species are the molecules representing the initial reactants, final products, and the stable and unstable intermediates in the reacting system. In a methane burner, for example, the methane fuel (CH<sub>4</sub>) reacts with oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to form the products water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). While this process can be modeled by a single global reaction for the four species, greater accuracy is achieved by resolving the intermediate species that are formed during the fuel conversion. This includes stable intermediate species like carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (CH<sub>2</sub>O) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and highly reactive radical species like atomic hydrogen (H), atomic oxygen (O) and the hydroxyl radical (OH).</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Resolving intermediate species is critical to accurately predict the ignition properties and pollutant emissions (e.g., NO<sub>x</sub> and soot) for commercial combustion applications. However, the use of detailed fuel chemistry for transportation fuels has had limited use in commercial combustor design because of the prohibitive computational cost. Zero-RK directly addresses this challenge and allows design calculations to use more than ten times the number of intermediates.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The highest fidelity models for realistic transportation fuels (e.g., gasoline and diesel) require thousands of intermediate species to be resolved. Zero-RK has been designed to calculate the necessary chemistry quantities in a computationally efficient manner by use of carefully designed algorithms that minimize the number of necessary operations while taking advantage of memory cache and vector arithmetic capabilities present in modern computing processors.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Description</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p>LLNL computational scientists have developed a new technology that solves critical problems for combustion engineers and designers. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>LLNL's Zero-Order Reaction Kinetics (Zero-RK) is a software package for simulating chemically reacting systems. Zero-RK's algorithms dramatically reduce the time to results for many commercial applications, providing in some cases a three-orders-of-magnitude reduction in simulation time. Zero-RK's feature set, including simulation of zero- and quasi-dimensional reactor systems, reaction sensitivity analyses, and coupling to CFD packages, allows users to simulate a wide variety of systems and devices. These systems include internal combustion engines for automotive and heavy-duty platforms, gas turbines, rocket engines, and industrial burners.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Advantages</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p>The key innovation inherent in Zero-RK is the sparse, adaptive precondition (SAP) method, which dramatically reduces the cost of integration for chemical systems comprised of many species. In addition, Zero-RK incorporates efficient algorithms for evaluating species' thermo-physical functions and chemical reaction rates. The resulting improvement in simulation turn-around time is dramatic in many applications. For example, solution time scales linearly with the number of included chemical species in zero-dimensional reactor simulations. For the largest system analyzed, the reduction in simulation time for Zero-RK compared to the best competing commercial package is over ten times. Compared to the best free alternative, Zero-RK achieves a four-thousand-fold reduction in simulation time. These simulation time reductions translate directly to other reactor configurations. Zero-RK has been used to develop a rapid compression machine model that runs in minutes instead of days. When coupled with sophisticated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) packages, Zero-RK based models can reduce the chemistry cost by a factor of seven for realistic transportation fuels.</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Prior to Zero-RK, simulations would often take days to complete, even with supercomputers. Due to time restraints and prohibitive computation costs, engineers were forced to use fewer intermediate chemical species, resulting in less accurate simulations and, ultimately, less efficient combustion engines. Zero-RK significantly increased simulation accuracy by allowing calculations to use more than ten times the number of intermediate chemical species for the same computational cost as the best commercial solver while also lowering simulation costs.</span></p>

<DESC><br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Acquisition and Grants Office Eastern Acquisition Division located in Norfolk Virginia, proposes to negotiate a contract modification on a basis of other than full and open competition in support of the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) of the National Weather Service (NWS) with Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC. The contract modification will extend the contract for six (6) months and will contain two (2) three (3) month options.  This contract modification will cover the period from February 17, 2016, through August 16, 2016. Should the contract options be exercised then the contract will be extended through February 16, 2017.
<p>This action is required to extend the current contract to ensure the completion of key product improvements and sufficient transition time to hand off a stable software baseline in support of the new contract. It is mission critical to sustain continuity of services and seamless operations of the NWS. This acquisition is to provide uninterrupted contractor support services to meet the operational mission of the NWS. AWIPS serves as the primary system for NWS forecasters, providing an extensible architecture to allow for highly available data communications, processing, and meteorological and hydrologic display capabilities in an integrated environment. AWIPS ingests observation, sensor, and model data input, processes these data into weather products, allowing forecaster interaction in product creation, and disseminates these products to the public and specific stakeholders. This mission critical system is the backbone for NWS to fulfill its mission of protecting lives and property. As a result, AWIPS must maintain the highest possible level of availability, throughput and data quality in order for the NWS to effectively complete its mission.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC, (Raytheon) is uniquely qualified to provide these services to NWS/AWIPS based upon Raytheon having ten (10) years of experience under its existing contract with NWS operating and maintaining AWIPS, and they have been the sole company developing the new software baseline for AWIPS (termed &lsquo;AWIPS II') and are uniquely qualified to complete key product improvement initiatives dependent on the activation of the AWIPS II Migration project.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, any firm that believes that it can provide the services as described that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division is hosting an Industry Day.  The Sailor 2025 Integrated Product Team will provide an overview of the program followed by an open forum questions and answer session.
 
The Sailor 2025 project is a transformational Navy training initiative that will accelerate the learning of every Sailor for faster response to our rapidly changing warfighting requirements, and achieve higher performance by coupling the timing of training delivery with every Sailorâ€™s actual deck plate need. Ready, Relevant, Learning (RRL) creates a learning continuum across a Sailorâ€™s career, from recruit to master chief that will ensure every Sailor has the latest training to support assigned task.
 RRL will modernize delivery methods from traditional brick-and-mortar schoolhouses to mobile, multi-media, multi-platform delivery solutions that leverage the best concepts to accelerate learning as individuals, teams and organizations. Finally, RRL will allow rapid infusion of relevant course content to accelerate the dissemination of critical warfighting knowledge to Sailors.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 
 
This special notice is being issued In order to provide all interested parties with information on the planned acquisition strategy as determined through market research.  
This procurement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis.  A sources sought notice was posted to FedBizOps 28 April 2016 (N62470-16-R-5008) to determine availability and capability of businesses to perform the requirement.  Given the nature of this work, particularly the size and complexity, market research revealed that there is not a reasonable expectation that offers from two (2) or more small businesses with acceptable technical proposals, at a reasonable price would be received if any type of set-aside was pursued.
  NAVFAC Atlantics Office of Small Business Programs concurs with the determination to solicit as an unrestricted procurement.  
The solicitation will include NAVFACâ€™s standard small business evaluation factor which will require all entities to demonstrate their small business past performance usage as well as require large business entities to provide a small business subcontracting plan which will include NAVFACâ€™s standard subcontracting targets.
All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  All prospective contractors are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.
Additional information about the requirement will be provided in the pre-solicitation notice.
  No additional information is currently available.

<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking a commercialization partner for an opportunity based on a Mutualistic Microbe Complex Designed to Increase Plant Productivity.  The ORNL Technology Transfer Office will accept licensing applications through December 19, 2016.<br /><br />ORNL researchers have studied the impact of a constructed multiple-microbial member community for a bio-fertilizer for increased plant productivity. The bio-fertilizer is a mix of naturally occurring microbes (fungi and bacteria) that are symbionts that can advance food and energy (SAFE) crops, coined as SAFE bio-fertilizer.
<p>Initial greenhouse studies showed that the SAFE bio-fertilizer had a significant higher biomass yield on both poplar and corn plants.  Field crop studies in both poplar and corn confirmed the increased plant growth and additional benefits from the soil microflora such as increased pathogen resistance and increased crop drought tolerance.  The bio-fertilizer can be readily applied to seeds, plant surfaces, or soils, and is stable at the field-scale.  Application of SAFE bio-fertilizer is flexible in both formulation and agnostic to agriculture practice.  The following are some of the experimental validated advantages observed across different poplar and corn plant systems in the greenhouse at ORNL, and cases with completed field studies for these systems are also indicated below:<br />&nbsp; &bull;  Superior germination frequencies for faster crop establishment (poplar and corn, field studies)<br />&nbsp; &bull;  Increased growth and biomass (poplar and corn, field studies)<br />&nbsp; &bull;  Increased plant defense against pathogens <br />&nbsp; &bull;  Improved drought tolerance (poplar, field studies)<br />&nbsp; &bull;  Improved soil heath (corn, field studies)<br />This technology was originally developed using federal funds and selected for further development under the laboratory's Technology Innovation Program (TIP). TIP supports technology development using royalties from existing technology licenses to accelerate the market readiness of high potential technologies.</p>
<p>License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology.  If a license is executed, the ORNL researchers developing the technology will be eligible to compete for additional TIP funding to further advance the technology.</p>
<p>Please contact Jennifer Caldwell, Group Leader, Technology Commercialization, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 865.574.4180, caldwelljt@ornl.gov with any questions and to obtain a license application for this opportunity.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information and Invitation to a Site Visit to the United States Department of Homeland Security Plum Island Animal Disease Center for the Installation and Commissioning of a Baker Class III Biological Safety Cabinet<br /><br />PURPOSE<br /><br />The purpose of this Special Notice is to invite prospective offerors to participate in a Request for Information (RFI) and a site visit of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Directorate of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) located on Plum Island, New York, regarding the installation and commissioning of a Baker Class III Biological Safety Cabinet (referred to as a "Glovebox") in laboratory space at PIADC.  The information exchanged during this site visit will help the Government to develop the Statement of Work (SOW) for project.<br /><br />The site visit is scheduled for Tuesday, December 13, 2016.  In the event of inclement weather, the alternate date for the site visit will be Wednesday, December 14, 2016.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />Since 1954, PIADC has served as the nation's premier defense against accidental or intentional introduction of transboundary animal diseases (a.k.a. foreign animal diseases) including foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).  PIADC is the only laboratory in the nation that can work on live FMD virus (FMDV).  The lab and its staff of nearly 400 employees provide a host of high-impact, indispensable preparedness and response capabilities, including vaccine Research and Development (R&amp;D), diagnostics, training, and bioforensics among others.
<p>PIADC operates Biosafety Level (BSL) 2, BSL-3 Enhanced, Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL-3) and Biosafety Level 3 Agriculture (BSL-3Ag) laboratory and animal research facilities.  PIADC utilizes well-established, contemporary biosafety and biosecurity practices and procedures to ensure the safety and security of personnel, the facility and materials including the animal disease-causing organisms under study.  These measures help prevent laboratory-acquired infections, cross contamination within the facility and the release or escape of these organisms into the environment.  The stringent and rigorously observed safety and security measures for the biocontainment facility include:</p>
<p>&bull;	Restricted access for only authorized and trained employees and approved visitors.</p>
<p>&bull;	Trained security professionals and various surveillance systems.</p>
<p>&bull;	Biocontainment laboratory facility such as vivarium and effluent decontamination systems operating under strict biosafety and biosecurity requirements including meeting or exceeding those required by the federal select agent program.</p>
<p>&bull;	A skilled operations and maintenance staff monitor laboratory air handling systems in real-time to help maintain biocontainment.  The laboratory spaces on Plum Island are isolated from non-biocontainment areas using a system that draws fresh air in and filters the air before being exhausted from the facility.  In addition, the inside of the biocontainment laboratory is kept at a lower air pressure than the ambient air outside.  This helps ensure air inside the biocontainment laboratory does not leave the facility without first being adequately filtered.</p>
<p>&bull;	Employees are required to take special precautions while working in a biocontainment laboratory to ensure they do not contaminate themselves or inadvertently carry disease-causing agents outside the laboratory.  To accomplish this critical biosafety objective, PIADC utilizes a combination of specialized containment equipment, facility design, trained staff and established procedures and practices.  For example, personnel are required to change clothes prior to entering the biocontainment laboratory and to remove laboratory-provided clothing and shower before leaving specific areas within the biocontainment facility, and again when leaving the biocontainment facility at the end of the work period.</p>
<p>&bull;	Prior to gaining access to the biocontainment facility, all employees and visitors must agree to observe a Personal Recognizant Quarantine for a defined time period which precludes these individuals from having contact with animal species that are susceptible to the disease-causing organisms under study at the facility.</p>
<p>&bull;	All biocontainment waste which leaves the facility must undergo biological decontamination process. These include chemical (liquid and gaseous) and physical (heat and incineration) methods.</p>
<p>Located a mile and a half off of the eastern tip of Long Island, New York, Plum Island is accessible only by Government chartered ferry with scheduled departures and arrivals from Orient Point, New York, and Old Saybrook, Connecticut.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>The overall objective of this project is to install and commission a new Baker Class III cabinet in an existing laboratory space.  This included having this Baker Class III cabinet verified as fully functional by a commissioning agent hired by the Contractor and approved by the Government.</p>
<p>This project also requires that the Contractor remodel the working space and some support utilities, for instance electricity, potable water, and drains.</p>
<p>As part of installation, commissioning, and remodeling, a commissioning agent mentioned above shall verify that the glovebox functions properly and all Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and other systems are able to maintain a negative pressure (relative to adjacent spaces) for the workspace in all normal and transient modes of operation.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall manage all aspects of this work in conjunction with and with the approval of DHS Contracting and Engineering.</p>
<p>In addition to the remodeling required for the Glovebox, alternate office space is required to be furnished for the PIADC Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) contractor to use for biological validation support activities.  This space is required to accommodate existing support functions displaced by the repurposing of two rooms in the laboratory space.</p>
<p>This space shall consist of at least 480 square feet of office/laboratory space for processing of biological indicators, instrument storage and calibration staging and misc. office space.  This space shall connect to the site communications and power systems.  No plumbing is required.<br />Power and connectivity needs are for telephones, computer work stations and sufficient power for lighting, HVAC and laboratory support operations.  This space shall be located in an agreed to area behind the existing Government trailer near where temporary storage presently exists. These connections will be made by the contractor with support from the O&amp;M contractor as needed.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code corresponding to this effort is 236220 for Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, however, other similar NAICS codes may be considered.</p>

<p>SECTION II - TECHNICAL CAPABILITY</p>

<p>b. Experience: The services requested are highly specialized requiring experienced translators with familiarity of military jargon and terminology. Prior US Air Force military service is desirable, but not required.</p>

<p>In 2012 Air Force ISR finds itself at a culminating point-a place where the demand, disposition, and development of current capabilities, arrayed against future requirements, force some critical decision making. After a decade of war, the service is well postured to operate in permissive environments, deploying sufficient airborne ISR with up to 65 combat air patrols (CAP) and enough processing, exploitation, and PED capacity to meet war-fighter and national-level needs. However, in the absence of objectively determined joint requirements, continuing demands for additional CAPs are unsustainable. Additionally, a variety of the Department of Defense's (DOD) independent ISR projects driven by joint urgent operational needs to satisfy a considered shortfall for today's fight calls for review. In recognition of the changing security environment and the need to understand and present the Air Force's ISR enterprise as a holistic set of capabilities-not a narrowly prescribed set of remotely piloted aircraft system CAPs-in June 2011 the secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) authorized a comprehensive review of that enterprise.</p>
<p>SECTION III -- EVALUATION OF OFFER - A Subject Matter Expert will assess the translation paragraph for accuracy. Those vendors determined to be technically acceptable will be listed, high to low, according to price. At least 3 BPAs will be issued to the 3 lowest technically acceptable vendors.</p>

<p>Attachment 1 - PWS<br />Air Force Research Institute (AFRI)<br />Translation Services<br />Performance-based Work Statement<br />(PWS)</p>
<p><br />1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.</p>
<p>1.1. Background: The Air Force Research Institute (AFRI) generates, manages, publishes and distributes the Air and Space Power Journal (ASPJ) in six languages (English, Arabic, Chinese, French, Portuguese, and Spanish) that are uniquely tailored for constituent readers and regional air forces. The five foreign language journals (Arabic, Africa and Francophonie [French], Chinese, Portuguese, and Spanish) regularly require translation of English language text into the appropriate (target) language for their constituents. AFRI has traditionally used independent translators, but desires to convert to a translation contract to ensure cost effectiveness, timeliness, quality and compliance with regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>1.2. Scope of Work: The contractor shall, except as specified in this Performance-based Work Statement (PWS) as government furnished property or services provide all personnel, supervision, and any items and services necessary to perform translation services for AFRI as defined in this PWS. The contractor shall perform the requirements in this PWS, conform to the professional standards identified in this contract, and shall follow all applicable instructions and directives as identified in this PWS. Contractor tasks include the following: translating articles, book reviews, and other documents as required; quality checking translated documents, providing translated documents in specified electronic formats, and development of a style guide to aid with future translations. The contractor shall submit reports and documentation as identified throughout this PWS. Requests for such reports and documentation and responses shall be coordinated through the government point of contact (POC).</p>
<p>1.3 Program Overview: AFRI requires translation services capable of translating documents, which are both scholarly and technical in nature. Quality and timeliness of effort are the critical factors for this contract. Effort will be year-round with multiple spikes as each quarterly journal approaches deadline. Nominally 70% of the translations will be from English to one or more of the other target languages. Each of the five journals will submit 6-8 articles quarterly (Chinese 8-10) for translation. On average, articles run approximately 6,000 words in length in English. Additionally, one to three book reviews may be submitted by up to four journals quarterly. Book reviews generally run about 1,000 words in English. The annual effort should be no less than approximately 840,000 words [5 (journals) X 7 (articles) X 6,000 (words/article) X 4 (quarters)]. An additionally 48,000 words for book reviews may be submitted.</p>
<p>1.3.1 Target languages required (by dialect if applicable):</p>
<p>a. English <br />b. Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic or MSA)<br />c. French<br />d. Spanish<br />e. Portuguese (Brazilian)<br />f. Chinese (Simplified)</p>
<p>1.4. Translation Requirements and Specific Tasks.</p>
<p>1.4.1. Translator qualifications:</p>
<p>a. Qualifications: Translator must be a Chinese native speaker with a superior knowledge of the Chinese language, grammar, spelling and syntax and able to translate material from English to Chinese and Chinese to English.</p>
<p>b. Experience: The services requested are highly specialized requiring experienced translators with familiarity of military jargon and terminology.</p>
<p>c. Educational level: A Chinese major college degree or equivalent level of professional language knowledge and expertise.</p>
<p>d. Certification: Must be a certified Chinese translator by the American Translators Association (ATA). Certification may be waived, on a case-by-case basis, for translators who have previously completed satisfactory work with AFRI.</p>
<p>1.4.2. Translation delivery timelines:</p>
<p>1.4.2.1. Initial translations shall be delivered within 7 business days after receipt of document(s) for translation. Allowing for the extremely difficult technical language and extended length of some submissions, a request for extension of due date to 15 business days, after receipt of document(s) for translation, may be accepted for no more than 20% of requested translations.</p>
<p>1.4.2.2. Translations returned by government for correction/rework shall be delivered no later than 5 business days after receipt.</p>
<p>1.4.3. Translation Quality: Translation submissions must follow the language register of the document submitted for translation. ASPJ in all versions is a scholarly journal; translated articles must be written in styles and grammar appropriate to current journals' standards. ASPJ editors will reject articles, regardless of error rate, if the company submits an article to AFRI which does not meet the language register quality requirement.</p>
<p>1.4.3.1. There must be fewer than three material errors in each completed work. Material errors include grammar, transposition of facts, and loss of meaning or coherency in translation.</p>
<p>1.4.3.2. Translations shall be accurate, clear and sensitive to the cultural, political and social environment of the target audience.</p>
<p>1.4.3.3. Translators shall be familiar with the normal phraseology of military forces, specifically air forces, in the target language.</p>
<p>1.4.3.4. A style guide shall be initiated within 60 days of award and submitted to the appropriate AFRI journal editor, by language, for consolidation and shared distribution to minimize repetitive errors when confronted with specific military jargon (e.g., proper translation and use of acronyms) or terms which may have multiple possibilities for translations. Updates will be due to the appropriate journal editor quarterly.</p>
<p>1.5. Administrative Requirements.</p>
<p>1.5.1 Work efforts will be accountable (paid for) by the piece by word count.</p>
<p>1.5.2. Submissions from the company to AFRI should be in Microsoft Word-doc. (Microsoft Office 2007 - Word)</p>
<p>1.5.3. Electronic submissions (via email) are required.</p>
<p>1.5.4. There is no typesetting or specific format requirement. Contractors will follow the general format of the submitted paper.</p>
<p>1.5.6. All files for submission must be screened and cleaned by the author using an up-to-date virus/spyware scanning program before sending to AFRI.</p>
<p>2. GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>2.1. Performance Management</p>
<p>2.1.1. Quality Control: The contractor shall implement a quality control plan to ensure services are performed in accordance with commonly accepted commercial practices to identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective translation services.</p>

<p>In 2012 Air Force ISR finds itself at a culminating point-a place where the demand, disposition, and development of current capabilities, arrayed against future requirements, force some critical decision making. After a decade of war, the service is well postured to operate in permissive environments, deploying sufficient airborne ISR with up to 65 combat air patrols (CAP) and enough processing, exploitation, and PED capacity to meet war-fighter and national-level needs. However, in the absence of objectively determined joint requirements, continuing demands for additional CAPs are unsustainable. Additionally, a variety of the Department of Defense's (DOD) independent ISR projects driven by joint urgent operational needs to satisfy a considered shortfall for today's fight calls for review. In recognition of the changing security environment and the need to understand and present the Air Force's ISR enterprise as a holistic set of capabilities-not a narrowly prescribed set of remotely piloted aircraft system CAPs-in June 2011 the secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) authorized a comprehensive review of that enterprise.</p>
<p>SECTION III -- EVALUATION OF OFFER - A Subject Matter Expert will assess the translation paragraph for accuracy. Those vendors determined to be technically acceptable will be listed, high to low, according to price. At least 3 BPAs will be issued to the 3 lowest technically acceptable vendors.</p>

<p>Attachment 1 - PWS<br />Air Force Research Institute (AFRI)<br />Translation Services<br />Performance-based Work Statement<br />(PWS)</p>
<p><br />1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.</p>
<p>1.1. Background: The Air Force Research Institute (AFRI) generates, manages, publishes and distributes the Air and Space Power Journal (ASPJ) in six languages (English, Arabic, Chinese, French, Portuguese, and Spanish) that are uniquely tailored for constituent readers and regional air forces. The five foreign language journals (Arabic, Africa and Francophonie [French], Chinese, Portuguese, and Spanish) regularly require translation of English language text into the appropriate (target) language for their constituents. AFRI has traditionally used independent translators, but desires to convert to a translation contract to ensure cost effectiveness, timeliness, quality and compliance with regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>1.2. Scope of Work: The contractor shall, except as specified in this Performance-based Work Statement (PWS) as government furnished property or services provide all personnel, supervision, and any items and services necessary to perform translation services for AFRI as defined in this PWS. The contractor shall perform the requirements in this PWS, conform to the professional standards identified in this contract, and shall follow all applicable instructions and directives as identified in this PWS. Contractor tasks include the following: translating articles, book reviews, and other documents as required; quality checking translated documents, providing translated documents in specified electronic formats, and development of a style guide to aid with future translations. The contractor shall submit reports and documentation as identified throughout this PWS. Requests for such reports and documentation and responses shall be coordinated through the government point of contact (POC).</p>
<p>1.3 Program Overview: AFRI requires translation services capable of translating documents, which are both scholarly and technical in nature. Quality and timeliness of effort are the critical factors for this contract. Effort will be year-round with multiple spikes as each quarterly journal approaches deadline. Nominally 70% of the translations will be from English to one or more of the other target languages. Each of the five journals will submit 6-8 articles quarterly (Chinese 8-10) for translation. On average, articles run approximately 6,000 words in length in English. Additionally, one to three book reviews may be submitted by up to four journals quarterly. Book reviews generally run about 1,000 words in English. The annual effort should be no less than approximately 840,000 words [5 (journals) X 7 (articles) X 6,000 (words/article) X 4 (quarters)]. An additionally 48,000 words for book reviews may be submitted.</p>
<p>1.3.1 Target languages required (by dialect if applicable):</p>
<p>a. English <br />b. Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic or MSA)<br />c. French<br />d. Spanish<br />e. Portuguese (Brazilian)<br />f. Chinese (Simplified)</p>
<p>1.4. Translation Requirements and Specific Tasks.</p>
<p>1.4.1. Translator qualifications:</p>
<p>a. Qualifications: Translator must be a Chinese native speaker with a superior knowledge of the Chinese language, grammar, spelling and syntax and able to translate material from English to Chinese and Chinese to English.</p>
<p>b. Experience: The services requested are highly specialized requiring experienced translators with familiarity of military jargon and terminology.</p>
<p>c. Educational level: A Chinese major college degree or equivalent level of professional language knowledge and expertise.</p>
<p>d. Certification: Must be a certified Chinese translator by the American Translators Association (ATA). Certification may be waived, on a case-by-case basis, for translators who have previously completed satisfactory work with AFRI.</p>
<p>1.4.2. Translation delivery timelines:</p>
<p>1.4.2.1. Initial translations shall be delivered within 7 business days after receipt of document(s) for translation.

<p>1.4.2.2. Translations returned by government for correction/rework shall be delivered no later than 5 business days after receipt.</p>
<p>1.4.3. Translation Quality: Translation submissions must follow the language register of the document submitted for translation. ASPJ in all versions is a scholarly journal; translated articles must be written in styles and grammar appropriate to current journals' standards. ASPJ editors will reject articles, regardless of error rate, if the company submits an article to AFRI which does not meet the language register quality requirement.</p>
<p>1.4.3.1. There must be fewer than three material errors in each completed work. Material errors include grammar, transposition of facts, and loss of meaning or coherency in translation.</p>
<p>1.4.3.2. Translations shall be accurate, clear and sensitive to the cultural, political and social environment of the target audience.</p>
<p>1.4.3.3. Translators shall be familiar with the normal phraseology of military forces, specifically air forces, in the target language.</p>
<p>1.4.3.4. A style guide shall be initiated within 60 days of award and submitted to the appropriate AFRI journal editor, by language, for consolidation and shared distribution to minimize repetitive errors when confronted with specific military jargon (e.g., proper translation and use of acronyms) or terms which may have multiple possibilities for translations. Updates will be due to the appropriate journal editor quarterly.</p>
<p>1.5. Administrative Requirements.</p>
<p>1.5.1 Work efforts will be accountable (paid for) by the piece by word count.</p>
<p>1.5.2. Submissions from the company to AFRI should be in Microsoft Word-doc. (Microsoft Office 2007 - Word)</p>
<p>1.5.3. Electronic submissions (via email) are required.</p>
<p>1.5.4. There is no typesetting or specific format requirement. Contractors will follow the general format of the submitted paper.</p>
<p>1.5.6. All files for submission must be screened and cleaned by the author using an up-to-date virus/spyware scanning program before sending to AFRI.</p>

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award.

The underlying factors leading to the failure of public health measures to control pertussis disease using currently licensed vaccines are poorly understood. A more complete understanding of this disease and of the mechanisms of vaccine-mediated protection is a critical public health need.&nbsp; Currently, the baboon model of pertussis, developed in the laboratories of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), is the only animal model of pertussis that recapitulates the disease as observed in human patients. The use of this animal model to study pertussis pathogenesis, evaluate host responses to pertussis infection and vaccination, and evaluate candidate vaccines and therapeutics require large numbers of weanling baboons be delivered to the CBER primate facility over the study period.</span></p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p><br />252.204-7004 Alternate A, System for Award Management (May 2013)</p>
<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 6K Overhaul Kits for 6 Cylinder (M12701638) 1 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>
<p>(1) "Defense items," defined in the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778(j)(4)(A), as defense articles, defense services, and related technical data, and further defined in the ITAR, 22 CFR Part 120.</p>
<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>
<p>(3) The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.);</p>

<p>(6) Executive Order 13222, as extended.</p>
<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>

<p>(1) A statement as to whether DoD agrees that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract; and</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a USCG procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0005 - is to add the following Questions and Answers:
<p>1) There appears to be changes in this RFP from the previous contract, most importantly that Purchase Requests (PR) for supplies, chemicals, etc. Are to be included in our proposal cost and not be reimbursable, please confirm that this is correct.</p>
<p>This is correct. Technical Exhibit 3 provides estimate costs averaged for historical data concerning operations, maintenance and repair costs.</p>
<p>2) Will the service orders (SO) be reimbursed to the contractor or will the contractor have to assume the cost risk for repairs to the treatment plants?</p>
<p>This is a Firm Fixed Price contract. All cost associated with the daily operations, maintenance and repairs of the Water Plants, associated equipment and RO's are the contractor's responsibility as outlined in the<br />PWS. DPW will be responsible for repairs to items such as structural (building components not associated with the water processing equipment), grounds (such as berm erosion, brine pond liners) to name a few.</p>
<p>3) The Purchase Requests (PR) costs listed on Technical Exhibit 3 appear to be considerably low, can you please confirm that these are actually costs?</p>
<p>Technical Exhibit 3 has been updated to reflect current PR and SO expenditures.</p>
<p>4) Who handles the compliance sampling?</p>
<p>DPW Environmental Division</p>
<p>5) Will we be billing a single lump sum cost with 4 option years to include materials costs in Exhibit 3?</p>
<p>Yes, all labor and materials need to be included under the CLIN for Operations and Maintenance. (Technical Exhibit 3 has been updated to reflect current/updated PR and SO expenditures.)</p>
<p>6) Will contractor be responsible for catastrophic failure of major equipment items not covered by Exhibit 3 values?</p>
<p>Natural catastrophic failures, such as fire, electrical surge, and storm and so on, not caused by contractor negligence will be the responsibility of DPW. Catastrophic failure of any level if determine to be caused by contractors negligence will be deemed the contractor fault and responsibility.</p>
<p>7) Who is responsible for brine paid liner repairs? Have historic repairs been repaired?</p>
<p>All three brine ponds, KFR, WCA and HCA, have had issues with the liners tearing and have been repaired at DPW expense. We have an existing tear at the HCA brine pond on the North West corner which will require the brine pond to be drained by Water Plant operators divert water flow, DPW will then coordinate sludge removal and liner repair.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modification #4</span>:</strong><br /><br />Q13: Could you clarify if the Firm Background Information required in the list of items on page 13 refers to a completely filled out US Firm Information Form or is it referring to a separate descriptive write-up and summary of the qualifications of the US Firm and its subcontractors?
<p>A13: The U.S. Firm Information Form referenced on pg 13 of the RFP refers to the documents included under the RFP Annex 6: U.S. Firm Information Form.</p>
<p>Q14: The CV template requires staff to fill in birthdates.  What is the purpose of this requirement and will the confidentiality and security of staff providing this information be guaranteed?</p>
<p>A14: Clause 2.8 of the RFP requires the Grantee (KenGen) to maintain confidentiality of the information submitted by the Offerors. KenGen will therefore endeavor to maintain confidentiality of information contained in the proposals. Regarding the date of birth on the proposals, KenGen does not consider this to be material to evaluation of the proposal. Therefore providing the date of birth on the CVs is optional.</p>
<p>Amendment to RFP Submission Deadline (reference to RFP Section 2.13, Annex 1)</p>
<p>The RFP proposal submission deadline has been extended to November 29, 2016. Interested U.S. firms should submit their proposal directly to the Grantee by 1400 East Africa Standard Time, 29 November 2016.</p>
<p>Q15: Are manual, ink-on-paper signatures required for all forms and staff member CVs (including subcontractors) in our original proposal? Or are digital or scanned signatures allowed in the original proposal?</p>
<p>A15: Digital or scanned signatures are allowed.</p>
<p>Q16: Are the "monthly reporting updates" referenced in Task 1 of the TOR in reference to the Contractor's progress in completing the scope of the Feasibility Study, or is this in reference to construction monitoring?</p>
<p>A16: The "monthly reporting updates" refers to Contractor's progress in completing work pursuant to the terms of reference for the Feasibility Study, usually expected to be submitted by the 5th of every month.</p>
<p>Q17: Are the "existing reports" referenced in Task 1 of the TOR limited to the "Annex 2: USTDA Background Study Report on the Project" or have additional reports been prepared.  If additional reports have been prepared, please provide a summary of the reports.</p>
<p>A17: All the available and relevant data and reports in the possession of KenGen will be provided to the successful bidder once the Feasibility Study contract commences. The Annex 2 Desk Study Report provides a summary of the project development activity undertaken to date.</p>
<p>Q18: Please provide any clarification regarding the hybrid configuration of the solar facility noted in Task 3.  Is the intention to utilize the hydro system to smooth the power curve of the PV system?</p>
<p>A18: The successful Offeror's role in the assignment is to conduct an analysis and recommend potential options of connecting the solar PV plant to the existing hydro plants in a hybrid arrangement.</p>
<p>Q19: How detailed does the Grantee expect the "conceptual design for the new solar PV plant and power evacuation facility to the national grid" to be? For example, would it include single line diagrams, specification of conductor size and substation equipment, and design of protection systems?</p>
<p>A19: The design should be done to sufficient level of details to form a basis of cost estimation for financial and economic analysis and preparation of tender document for procurement of an EPC Contractor. It should be detailed enough and include all relevant information which can be used in the construction of the plant and the evacuation facility. It should include single line diagrams, specification of conductor size and substation equipment, design and configuration of protection systems and metering systems.</p>
<p>Q20: Regarding the operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) review, will the Contractor be expected to provide a staffing plan or simply estimate the related expense as part of the O&amp;M expenses in total?</p>
<p>A20: The contractor is expected to provide a staffing plan, which will be the basis of estimating the staff costs.</p>
<p>Q21: Will the information provided by the Grantee include the transmission system power flow cases and single line diagrams of the substation and the transmission system? What will be the format of the power flow case?</p>
<p>A21: KenGen will provide transmission system power flow cases and single line diagrams of the existing main substations and the transmission system prepared using PSSE software from Siemens PTI</p>

<DESC>These are responses to inquiries received on this action:<br /><br />Question 1: MADYMO References, Pgs. 98-99: Would the Government broaden the types of finite analysis for human injury modeling beyond MADYMO? Reason why: MADYMO is a fast running tool with limited accuracy for human injury modeling. That is why PEO STRI and the WIAMan program is developing new ADT models in LS-Dyna and another Finite Element code. The Marine Corps, PEO Land Systems, has taken the same approach for ATD modeling.<br /><br />USG Response 1: No we will not, for a limited and specific reason. The Government has a current mission that requires the use of Mathematical Dynamic MOdels (MADYMO), but is lacking the tool described&nbsp;in the task order to fulfill the effort. The task order, therefore, specifies MADYMO, rather than other Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tools for human injury modeling, because the required tool must interface with MADYMO in order to satisfy this mission. Other types of finite analysis for human injury modeling would not be acceptable for this tool. The tool is to couple a MADYMO ATD model into LS-Dyna blast models.<br /><br />That being said, this is a specific task order under the master contract, and does not restrict what the Government intends to do under other task orders later on. It is very likely that there will be future task orders which will take the approach of using Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin Project (WIAman) or other Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) models. The master contract can support broader types of finite analysis as the question is suggesting, but that is not appropriate under this particular task order.<br /><br />Question 2: C.3.2 - Multi-scale Biomechanics Reliability Model Development: would the Government change the scope of this section to make clear an interest in leveraging (due to time and cost savings) commercially developed human body models -that can be licensed by the Government- and then refined to simulate blast impact injuries?<br /><br />USG Response 2: No we will not. The intent of this contract is to develop new tools for specific Government use and ownership, and not simply to use commercially available software that needs to be licensed and then modified.<br /><br />Question 3: Future Year Funding: SimBRS program was started by Congressionally-directed funding. What is the near term TARDEC budget for this opportunity?<br /><br />USG Response 3: The use of the contract mechanism is based on Government missions and budgets. While the Government does not have a specific SimBRS earmark for FY 17, the Government did not use earmarked funding on the expiring SimBRS contract during FY 16 either, because SimBRS now supports a number of ongoing Army programs. Our average total obligation over each of the past two fiscal years was approximately $5,800,000.00.<br /><br />Question 4: C.3.7 - High Performance Computing Incorporating Physics-Based Reliability and Safety Models: The High Performance Computing Collaboratory (HPCC) is mentioned. Would the Government remove mention of this program due to the HPCC being located at the incumbent's facility? And replace it with allowing the awardee to choose whether it uses private or HPCMP computational resources to support SimBRS/<br /><br />USG Response 4: Yes, thank you for bringing this to our attention. The reference to "HPCCL" in the draft was incorrect and will be corrected. All references to HPCC will be changed to reference the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP).<br /><br />Question 5: C.3.11-C.3.13: Would the Government consider adding language similar to the following: 'Proposers with direct experience modeling vehicles similar to those in PEO GCS and CS&amp;CSS - and subsystems that include active protection systems, seats, underbody hull materials - will receive increased credit in the past performance review by the SSEB?' Reason why: A proposer's past experience of support in these areas reduces risk to the SIMBRS program.<br /><br />USG Response 5: No, we will not. Reason: Because the intent of the contract is for tool development for the Government's use. It is the Government's position that experience in modeling does not necessarily provide risk reduction for tool development efforts.

NOTICE TO OFFERORS: The FAA has been exempted from several Federal laws and regulations as part of the 1996 DOT Appropriations Act, signed into law by President Clinton on November 15, 1995. Some of the exemptions include the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, the Small Business Act, the Competition in Contracting Act, and the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The FAAâ€™s new Acquisition Management System (AMS) became effective on April 1, 1996 and applies to this requirement.

NOTICE for informational purposes for Minority, Women-owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.

The upper reaches are characterized by rugged topography and adverse climatic conditions. The project site has a narrow bench and sharp curves making for a very limited construction site. The adjacent terrain is generally steep with tall slopes. This project is located in a sensitive natural setting. Mitigation of wetland areas, on-site and nearby, are included in the project. Provisions will be necessary to protect Federal or State listed endangered, threatened, or special concern species. Provisions will include limitations on when and where work can occur. Contractor-furnished biological monitors will be required for some elements of the work. An 11 acre government-owned material source has been identified along the lower and flatter portion of the road. The quality of material is generally acceptable, but may require removal of unacceptable material or blending to produce aggregate for surface course or asphalt.</span></span></span></span></p>

<DESC>NASA/APL has a requirement for the continuation of contract NAS5-97271 with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) for the continuation of the New Horizons Mission operations. JHU/APL is currently performing this requirement, which includes the daily ground station operations of the Mission Operations Center (MOC) for data collection, spacecraft health and status monitoring, system and subsystem engineering, navigation planning and execution, instrument operations, operations planning and execution, and science data analysis and dissemination to the scientific community and the public.<br /><br />NASA intends to issue a sole source request for proposal to JHU/APL. The estimated period of performance of the extended Cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract will be two years and nine months, from December 31, 2018 through September 30, 2021.<br /><br />JHU/APL is the only organization qualified to perform this requirement based on the following rationale:&nbsp; JHU/APL has the exclusive knowledge of how to effectively operate the New Horizons spacecraft and manage all aspects of the extremely high value, one-of-a-kind, NASA Science Mission, to explore Pluto and the Kuiper Belt. The JHU/APL has operated and maintained the New Horizons spacecraft from launch in January 2006, through the successful completion of the historic flyby of the Pluto-Charon system in July 2015, to the recent completion of the down link of all the Pluto Encounter Science data in October 2016. The Kuiper Belt Extended Mission (KEM) is dependent on the highly specialized and unique capabilities of JHU/APL, which includes: 1) Ground and flight systems; 2) Software, products, procedures, and tools necessary to operate the New Horizons spacecraft and obtain the required science data; 3) Mission critical, one-of-a-kind-equipment, such as the New Horizons Operations Simulator; and 4) Highly skilled and experienced engineers and scientists that have detailed knowledge of all the New Horizons spacecraft systems and subsystems, necessary to maintain the health and safety of the spacecraft and obtain the critical science data.<br /><br /><br />The statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source. However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 1, 2016. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the agency.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.<br /><br />

<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking a commercialization partner for an opportunity based on a Mutualistic Microbe Complex Designed to Increase Plant Productivity.  The ORNL Technology Transfer Office will accept licensing applications through December 19, 2016.<br /><br />ORNL researchers have studied the impact of a constructed multiple-microbial member community for a bio-fertilizer for increased plant productivity. The bio-fertilizer is a mix of naturally occurring microbes (fungi and bacteria) that are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>ymbionts that can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span>dvance <span style="text-decoration: underline;">f</span>ood and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">e</span>nergy (SAFE) crops, coined as SAFE bio-fertilizer.
<p>Initial greenhouse studies showed that the SAFE bio-fertilizer had a significant higher biomass yield on both poplar and corn plants.  Field crop studies in both poplar and corn confirmed the increased plant growth and additional benefits from the soil microflora such as increased pathogen resistance and increased crop drought tolerance.  The bio-fertilizer can be readily applied to seeds, plant surfaces, or soils, and is stable at the field-scale.  Application of SAFE bio-fertilizer is flexible in both formulation and agnostic to agriculture practice.  The following are some of the experimental validated advantages observed across different poplar and corn plant systems in the greenhouse at ORNL, and cases with completed field studies for these systems are also indicated below:<br />&nbsp; &bull;  Superior germination frequencies for faster crop establishment (poplar and corn, field studies)<br />&nbsp; &bull;  Increased growth and biomass (poplar and corn, field studies)<br />&nbsp; &bull;  Increased plant defense against pathogens <br />&nbsp; &bull;  Improved drought tolerance (poplar, field studies)<br />&nbsp; &bull;  Improved soil heath (corn, field studies)<br />This technology was originally developed using federal funds and selected for further development under the laboratory's Technology Innovation Program (TIP). TIP supports technology development using royalties from existing technology licenses to accelerate the market readiness of high potential technologies.</p>
<p>License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology.  If a license is executed, the ORNL researchers developing the technology will be eligible to compete for additional TIP funding to further advance the technology.</p>
<p>Please contact Jennifer Caldwell, Group Leader, Technology Commercialization, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 865.574.4180, caldwelljt@ornl.gov with any questions and to obtain a license application for this opportunity.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property<br />UTB ID 201503575, Complex of Mutualistic Microbes Designed to Increase Plant Productivity, U.S. Patent Application 15/334,793 and PCT Patent Application PCT/US16/58816, filed on October 26, 2016.<br /><br />Additional information, including technology summaries, is included on the ORNL website (https://www.ornl.gov/partnerships/mutualistic-microbes-plant-productivity).</p>

<CONTACT>Timothy Whitaker, Phone 2023071970, Email timothy.a.whitaker@usdoj.gov
<DESC>The Department of Justice is seeking attorneys to litigate debt collection cases for various Federal agencies. Using negotiated procedures authorized in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15, the Department of Justice (DOJ) contemplates award of up to four (4) contracts with private practitioners of law for debt collection services on behalf of the United States in the counties that comprise the Federal Judicial District for the Eastern District of Michigan. The DOJ launched the Private Counsel Program following the passage of the Federal Debt Recovery Act of 1986 which first authorized the use of private law firms for this purpose. The Debt Collection Management Staff manages the program with legal oversight by the United States Attorney's Offices at the district level. The program is currently running in 19 districts nationwide, with further expansion planned. This procurement is strictly limited to attorneys who are licensed to practice law in the Eastern District of Michigan. Contractors will be required to pursue debt collection activities which parallel existing industry procedures that have proven to be effective and efficient; to interact with government representatives at defined stages of the collection process (i.e., settlement, compromise, etc.); and to input relevant case data in a computer database maintained by the Government. Contract payments will be based primarily on contingency fee payments for unsecured debt collection. The anticipated period of performance for each contract will be a base year with up to four option years. The solicitation will be available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fbo.gov, and is anticipated to be released on or about&nbsp;November 17, 2016. Amendments to the solicitation, if any, issued prior to the receipt of proposals will also be posted on www.fbo.gov. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site for access to the solicitation. All responsible sources meeting the eligibility requirements may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. It is highly recommended that, prior to submitting a proposal, interested parties obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and register in the System for Award Management (SAM), www.sam.gov, as these requirements are mandatory for any firm selected for a contract award.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">The General Services Administration (GSA) hereby notifies of the intent to issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for a negotiated procurement for the <strong>Design/Build</strong> contract for construction of the new Building 54 as part of Phase 2 for the Consolidation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the St. Elizabeths Hospital site in Anacostia, DC. The scope will include design/build efforts from approximately 30% bridging documents and&nbsp;utilities coordination&nbsp;for the CUP2 Building.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">The Project will consist of the design and construction of the new building, localized soils stabilization efforts for several adjacent historic buildings, structural monitoring of the historic buildings and the installation of the related pads and mechanical and electrical equipment. Commissioning will also be part of the project. Building 54 is approximately 80,000 sf with 3-levels.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">The St Elizabeths site is approximately 176 acres and is a National Historic Landmark (NHL) site containing primarily office space and parking structures with some special buildings for conferences and food service. The site, located one mile east of DC on Martin Luther King Boulevard, is the former St. Elizabeths Hospital site in Anacostia, Washington, DC.&nbsp; Three phases are planned in total, with a phasing summary as follows: Phase 1 &ndash; new construction for the U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters (USCG) (1,179,500 gsf) [awarded September 2009] Adaptive reuse of historic buildings for DHS at 179,250 gsf; Phase 2 &ndash; The Center Building for DHS, Central Utility Plant and DHS Operations Center, a mix of new construction and adaptive reuse projects along with FEMA Headquarters at 1.7 million gsf and Phase 3 &ndash; a combination adaptive reuse and new construction for Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and DHS (1,398,150 gsf).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">The contractor must provide all design from the bridging documents, management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided) and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet GSA and client agency requirements. The contractor will perform the design and construction in accordance with the design specifications, bridging documents and terms and conditions of the contract.&nbsp; The estimated construction cost range is between $35 - 50 million.&nbsp; The Construction Performance Period shall not exceed 12 months.&nbsp; This contract is being procured using the 2 Phase Design Building Procedures in accordance with FAR 36.3.&nbsp; The contract will be Firm Fixed Price.&nbsp; The "Best Value Continuum, Tradeoff Process" is the method that will be used to evaluate price and other factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance, quality and pricing.&nbsp; The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, without necessarily basing selection on the lowest price.&nbsp; The Technical Evaluation Factors are:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(1) Experience </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: 1.7pt; line-height: normal;">This factor considers the extent of the Offeror's past performance with reference to such aspects as costs, timeliness, and technical success as part of the consideration.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>

The intent is to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for emergency response to actual or impending levee breaches/failures and resultant flooding events. Public Law 84-99 authorizes the Corps of Engineers to provide both technical and direct support in response to flood control and coastal emergencies. By its nature, this authorization covers no-notice events and mission critical requirements that cannot be met through a normal acquisition process and schedule. This acquisition will provide the contractual vehicle to meet the Sacramento District's mission responsibilities for direct support during a declared emergency.</p>
<p>The contract resulting from this acquisition will replace an IDIQ Requirements SATOC for emergency levee repairs, which expired 5 April 2013. This contract will have a 3-year base period and one 2-year option period with a total maximum contract capacity not to exceed $47M. The minimum ordering limit will be $3K and the maximum-ordering limit will be $47M. The minimum guarantee will be $3K. Being that we do not know the size of the emergency, it is important that we have the maximum flexibility in ordering what we need, when we need it. This Procurement will be conducted under PSC Code: Z1PC and NAICS Code: 237990, Maintenance of Unimproved real property (land) . The size standard for this NAICS code is $36,500,000.</p>
<p>The Government will select the offer that represents the best value to the Government by using the trade-off process described in FAR Part 15. This process permits tradeoffs between price and technical ("non-price") factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced offer. The award decision will be based on a comparative analysis and an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation.</p>
<p>All questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, SFC Kenetta Meares, by e-mail Kenetta.a.meares@usace.army.mil.</p>
<p>The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about 25 March 2016.</p>
<p>The site visit/pre-proposal conference date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation.<br />OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS</p>

<p>Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD format. The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the RFP is issued.

<DESC>ENSCO, Inc., Falls Church, Virginia, has been awarded a $145,200,000.00 (if all Options are exercised) with Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) being the principal contract type, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Firm Fixed Price&nbsp;Contract (FFP) for Systems Engineering and Integration support to Space and Missile Systems Center Range and Network Division (SMC/RN), Los Angeles AFB. Work will be performed at Los Angeles, California and Colorado Springs, Colorado, and is expected to be completed by Oct. 30, 2022 (should all Options be exercised). <br />This award is the result of a 100% Small Business Set-Aside competitive acquisition with multiple offers being received.<br />The Contractor will support new and on-going efforts in all phases of the acquisition life cycle, and standardize systems engineering processes.&nbsp; <br />This is a Consolidated contract combining three separate programs (technical baselines); Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN), the Launch and Test Range Systems (LTRS), and the Space Training Acquisition Office (STAO) under one contract to standardize system engineering processes and obtain robust integration capabilities to help bridge the gap between the sustainment, operations and acquisition communicties. As this contract is standarizing multiple and divergent programs and technical baselines, it was determined that use of a cost plus type of contract was most appropriate and in the Government's best interest to&nbsp;achieve success.&nbsp;

JUSTIFICATION 
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                          Office of Acquisition Operations
      Technology Acquisition Center
      23 Christopher Way
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
        
2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery order (DO) to be issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for the renewal of brand name Adobe LiveCycle software maintenance and technical support. 

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  VA Office of Information and Technology, Veterans Centered Experience, Enterprise Health Benefits Determination program office has a requirement for the renewal of Adobe LiveCycle software maintenance and technical support for perpetual software licenses VA already owns, specifically: 500 Adobe Document Security AEM 11- Per Recipient Platinum, four Adobe Document Security AEM 11 Per CPU   Platinum Annual Support Subscription, one Adobe Experience Manager Customer   Communications Add-on 11 Platinum Annual Support Subscription renewal   Per CPU, and two  Adobe Forms Portal 5.6 Platinum Annual   Support Subscription Renewal   Per CPU.  Software maintenance and technical support shall include periodic software updates, enhancements, and patches to software.  Technical support shall include enhanced self-help and search capabilities and voice support services.  The required maintenance and technical supports aides VA to maintain Portable Document Format (PDF) enhancement, process management, interactive forms, library forms, authentication, form and workflow change management, transactions, approvals, electronic signature, mobile application development, enhanced form security, electronic and postal forms delivery, content management and content access needed for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) enrollment forms, such as the Online 10-10EZ.  Veterans healthcare handbooks are now also being generated by Adobe, allowing more robust and accurate changes to be published quickly in a way that can be accessed by computes, smartphones, and tablets.  The period of performance is November 21, 2016 to November 20, 2017 with one 12 month option period.  

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled  Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.   

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph eight of this document, it was determined that limited competition is viable among Adobe resellers for this brand name maintenance and technical support.  Adobe is the developer of the software and is the only source that maintains and supports the software.  The software code is proprietary to Adobe, which restricts other software developers from gaining access to the software code.  Access is required in order to modify the code and implement the software updates, enhancements, and patches, which keeps the software operational and prevents security vulnerabilities.   Without this support, VA would face a degradation of the web services, content management, workflow, enhanced security, and other features embedded into VA s PDF documents developed to provide the online capability to submit applications for eligibility determination and enrollment. 

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in section 8 of this justification.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government s requirements.  It was determined, however that limited competition is available among authorized resellers for brand name Adobe LiveCycle software maintenance and technical support.  In accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A)(2), this justification will be provided with the solicitation to all appropriate NASA SEWP V GWAC holders.  Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.301 and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunities website and the justification will be made publicly available within 14 days of award.  

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the marketplace that would enable future actions to be competed.  Specifically, the Government will continue to monitor market trends, new/emerging products, looking for compatible technologies to meet VA needs.

8.  Market Research:  Market research was conducted in July 2016 by the Government s technical experts through reviews of commercial catalogs, technical reviews, and professional reviews regarding Adobe LiveCycle software maintenance and technical support to determine if sources other than Adobe or Adobe authorized resellers could provide the software maintenance and technical support.  This research included a review of similar software developers, including PerfectForms, Acquia, Drupal, WordPress, Frevvo, ExtremeForms, ProcessMaker, Microsoft, and RJSSoftware.  Based on technical and professional reviews of these products, the Government s technical experts determined that while these companies develop similar software, each one provides software maintenance for its own proprietary products, but is unable to provide maintenance and technical support for another company s proprietary products. 

The Contract Specialist conducted additional market research in September 2016 by utilizing the Provider Lookup tool on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP)Â V Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) website which identified Adobe LiveCycle software maintenance and technical support resellers, including two prospective Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) GWAC holders that are resellers of Adobe LiveCycle software maintenance and technical support.     

9.  Other Facts:  None.

D The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source
procedures.










D An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays.



















(S) DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:
  Market research indicates other companies' similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs. Due to the uniqueness Metasys software platform includes all transportation, labor, parts, unlimited software and hardware updates, onsite service, telephone support and Repair & Replacement Services Emergency Onsite Response service and maintenance visit during the contract period.  

















DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market research reveals that Johnson Controls manufactures and own propriety rights to the

Metasys software platform and mechanical controls used to operate the energy management system.

Attachment 2: Request for Limited Sources Justification Format >$150K

Metasys i s one of the three fired digital control energy system at HVMAC, and specific to Johnson  Controls  

















ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
Over the past four year Metasys as provided and quality services for $41200 (590-C60035),
$69,289.96 increase of additional equipment has been added.   (590-C50059l,$51,900 (590-C40464)
$51,132.00 and (590-C30095)$50378. 04.  Considering the services outlined in Paragraph 4, if this pricing  trend continued over the next five years, then the costs would be fair and reasonable  













A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
Under the authorities and actions cited above, and the fact there are no other available source,  there are no actions to be taken to overcome barriers to competition for this service contract. Johnson  Control Metasys has been operating at Hampton VA Medical Center for over 1 8 Years acquiring another  vendor would result in purchasing an entire new management system-this option is not practical nor feasible
