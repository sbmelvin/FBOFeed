<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to charter a LEAR Jet 25C to support deployment of remote sensing instruments: Airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL), Langley Airborne A-band Spectrometer (LAABS), and the HyperSpectral Polarimeter for Aerosol Retrievals (HySPAR).  These instruments operate only in a pressurized, temperature-controlled environment and acquire observations in a nadir-viewing geometry.  A pressurized aircraft with down-looking aircraft port windows of significant aperture are required to accommodate these and other anticipated instruments (e.g., two approximately 10 in. by 12 in. rectangular ports or similarly sized circular ports).   The instruments that will be flown on the aircraft are developmental.  It is anticipated that the instruments will require significant adjustments and frequent removal from the aircraft and transport to LaRC for rework of faulty subsystems.  To make frequent instrument rework practical without the expense of frequent investigator travel and instrument shipping, it is required that the Contractor provide a base of operations for the aircraft within a reasonable commuting distance of Langley Research Center (LaRC), Hampton, VA. The government's statement of work (SOW)is provided as Attachment 1. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from L-3 Communications Flight International Aviation LLC (CFIA).  CFIA is the only known source capable of providing a Lear Jet 25C aircraft with the required capabilities and configuration to support deployment of the sensing instruments. FAR 13.501 is the authority for procuring from a sole source. The government intends to acquire commercial services using FAR 12 and 13.5 procedures. The government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDQ)type contract consisting of a one-year Base Period and four, one-year Option periods. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 4, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  As a minimum, responses shall include an explanation and verfication that the offeror can comply with each aircraft requirement stipulated in Attachment 1 -SOW. Offerors proposing an aircraft requiring modifications that can not be completed prior to award (anticipated award date is on or about July 1, 2004), will be determined non-responsive. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Shape Memory Alloy Power-Off Clamps. NASA LaRC is seeking to develop an articulated truss wing via telescoping truss elements that elongate and contract to allow for large wing shape changes.  To ensure structural stability during operation, the truss elements must be locked in place and then released for wing shape changes.	The most efficient method of accomplishiong this function is through the fabrication of a clamping device which will allow the telescoping parts to move with respect to each other when commanded with no power consumption.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Boeing Phantom Works Seattle, Washington.  Boeing Phantom Works is the only known source capable of developing the clamps.  Boeing has developed other functionally equivalent systems and has gained knowledge and experience under contract number NAS1-99069 for the development of the first generation of articulated truss wing structures.  The Sole Source Authority is FAR 6.302.1. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Anita Eichler, Chevy Chase, MD.

Purpose:

The purpose of this requirement is to provide assistance and support for the Office of Policy, Planning and Budget (OPPB) on various agency-wide extramural policy, planning, and program activities.  This arrangement will enhance the ability of OPPB to address, coordinate, and implement these activities in a timely and effective manner.

 SAMHSAs vision is A Life in the Community for Everyone and its mission is to build resilience and facilitate recovery for people with or at risk for substance abuse and mental illness.  One of the primary ways that SAMHSA advances its mission is by providing funds to various entities, through discretionary grants and cooperative agreements.  The funds are used to address an array of issues related to the prevention and treatment of mental illness and addictive disorders. The programs funded by SAMHSA are authorized under the Public Health Service Act and are administered by the three SAMHSA Centers: the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention; the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment; and the Center for Mental Health Services.  

Over the last year, there have been significant changes made in the HHS grants policy that govern the operations of these programs and to the HHS and SAMHSA grant development and announcement processes.  In response to these extramural program changes, SAMHSA has accelerated the process of updating existing policy documents and developing new policy/guidance.  Also, to facilitate the transition, an internal staff-training component has been initiated. 

The OPPB maintains responsibility for working with agency staff to provide information and guidance to ensure a coordinated agency-wide planning effort and consistent implementation of grant application announcements, policy and procedures. The span of responsibilities is broad and ranges from working with the Centers and the Office of the Administrator staff from the conception of program ideas through program implementation.
 Ms. Anita Eichler served as the Director, Division of Planning and Budget in OPPB. In this position she was responsible for providing leadership and direction on a number of agency-wide extramural activities.  She played a major role in the management of the agencys grant development cycle, including the transition to the use of the four standard grant announcements.  As part of her responsibility, Ms. Eichler conducted internal staff training that focused on the integration of the NOFA and the standard announcements. 
THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>Introduction NASA LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Langley Research Center's Earth and Space Science Support Office (ESSSO). The ESSSO supports the NASA Headquarters Office of Space Science (OSS),the Office of Earth Science (OES), and other NASA functional areas.  Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is currently performing this effort under NAS1-00095. Working with the Office of Space Science, the Office of Earth Science and their customers, including academia, industry, NASA Centers and other Government Agencies, the ESSSO develops efficient methodologies for evaluation processes.  The office develops Announcement of Opportunities and NASA Research Announcements, conducts on-site evaluations, and conducts technical management, cost, and other program factors (TMCO) evaluations and proposals.  In addition, upon request, the ESSSO ensures that the criteria for high quality science return is within budget and that schedule constraints are met. Potential sources are sought capable of conducting proposal and mission concept evaluations, assessments, stuides, and other support areas as described in more detail below:  I. Proposal and Mission Concept Evaluations The contractor will be required to conduct evaluations of proposals and competitive mission concepts covering the technical, management, cost, and other program factors. Evaluation activities include:  Prepare supplementary material to accompany the Announcement of Opportunity (AO), NASA Research Announcement (NRA), Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN), or other Broad Agency Announcement (BAA); plan the logistics of the evaluation, identify expertise needed for the evaluation, evaluate compliance with administrative requirements of the BAA; and evaluate offered investigations, and report on panel findings.  Supplementary materials that accompany AO's include technical information related to the opportunity, report formats, and logistics guidelines needed by proposers responding to the AO.  The cost assessment capability covers technology development, space systems (including instruments) and related ground systems, and life-cycle costs. II. Assessments The contractor will be required to conduct assessments of current and potential NASA programs.  Types of assessments include technical; management; cost; risk; safety; environmental impact; mission trajectory; resource utilization; analyses of instruments, spacecraft and launch vehicle designs; systems engineering; fabrication; and Assembly, Test and Launch Operations. Technical assessment activities include assessing the likely performance of technical systems and the impact of new technologies on technical systems.

<SUBJECT>34 -- Machined Housing for a  Co-Conical Field Generation System
<SOLNBR>RA1341-04-RP-4032
<CONTACT>Jacqueline Wright, Contract Specialist, Phone (303) 497-5282, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email Jacqueline.S.Wright@noaa.gov - Rhonda Nelson, Procurement Technician, Phone (303) 497-3487, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email Rhonda.Nelson@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Institute Of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a commercially machined Co-Conical Field Generation System (CFGS) housing, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6-streamlined procedures for evaluation and solicitation for commercial items-as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with far part 13.  The solicitation number is RA1341-04-RP-4032 and is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through federal acquisition circular 2001-24.  The NAICS code is 332721, and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The Co-Conical Field Generation System (CFGS) is a set of expanding cones.   This machining contract will include the building a pair of cones, access doors, support structures, and alignment guides to test electromagnetic field and hazard probes.  The smaller (inner) cone will mount inside the larger (outer) cone with the alignment of the support structure then meet at the narrow tip in a microwave 2.92mm connector (specifically an Anritsu K-104F).  This system will be guiding RF energy from 10 MHz to 40 GHz. 
	The drawings shall be broken down into five major areas of design:  The Outer cone, (consisting of 8 major sub assemblies), the Inner cone (consisting of 5 major sub-assemblies), Outer Cone 2 and Door Assemblies, the CFGS Support, and the Inner Cone Support.  These drawings were designed using AutoCADs Inventor 8  to get full usage of design requirements Inventor 8 must be used to view the design. The use of non-ferrous materials is absolutely critical in the inner surface of the Outer-Cones (Skin parts of Outer Cones 6, 7, 8, and 9) and the outer surfaces of the Inner Cones.  The required blends of aluminum must be adhered to.
	Critical machining issues: 
Outer-Cone: The inner surfaces of the Outer-Cones and mating surfaces between Outer-Cone sections a must conform to the surface finish requirements, parallel restraints and flatness in the drawings.  The lack of a clean, machined finish will incur electro-magnetic losses and cause the system to be unstable.    
1)	Required Lathe  a vertical lathe with a minimum of 60 of travel will be required to perform the final finish cut on the outer cone.  Adjacent sections must be finished together to ensure a smooth transition between sections.  For the final passes the doors will be mounted in outer cone 2 and need to be machined so the inner surfaces of the doors are flush with the inner surface of outer cone 2.
2)	Inner-Cone: The outer surfaces of the Inner-Cones and mating surfaces between Inner-Cone sections a must conform to the surface finish requirements, parallel restraints and flatness in the drawings.  The lack of a clean, machined finish will incur electro-magnetic losses and cause the system to be unstable.    
3)	Outer-Cones 6, 7, 8 and 9:  The inner-surface profile is critical to making a smooth transition between a standard RF-microwave connector and the rest of the CFGS.  The AUTOCAD INVENTOR (*.idw) drawings in cfgs\outter cone\bessel cones have a defined profile that will be required during the machining process (not identified in the PDF version of the drawings).  This profile will be delivered in standard Machine-tool, CNC formatting in the distribution of the drawings  NIST will consult with contractor to determine actual format needed for the file to interface with the contractors available CNC equipment.
4)	Mating between sections:  the mating between sections of both the Inner and Outer Cone sections is critical.  Specification of the actual diameter of each section is less critical than the smoothness of the critical surfaces between sections.  Matched machining is required between sections to minimize this problem.   Adjoining sections must be mated together and final finish passes must be made together so these critical surfaces are smooth (the actual angle of the cones is not as important as the smoothness of the surface).
5)	Doors:  the inner surface of the doors must match the inner surface of the Outer-Cone 2. The mating specification on the top and bottom edges of the doors with the inner surface of Outer-Cone must be adhered to maintain RF performance.
6)	Note the dimensional tolerances on all drawings  These must be adhered to - surface finish and section mating are critical to system performance. 
7)	All bids must contain detailed processes on how the machining will be performed.  Bids will describe how tolerances will be held (with special notes on the mating of the door sections to cone 2 and cone section to cone section interfaces).  Machine tools to be used must be listed, with accuracy specifications, to verify ability of the bidder to construct the system.  Details of machining and construction of the skin sections for outer cones 1 through 5 must be described to determine suitability for use in electromagnetic energy propagation (see design considerations).         
Design considerations:
1)	Skin construction:  NIST suggests using the appropriate thickness of aluminum plate then bend the skin sections into rough shape, weld together with upper and lower rings and perform finish machining on the interior surfaces and ring ends, but the design of the skin sections shall be left to the contractor.  Other methods will be acceptable to complete the outer cones including machining out of solid stock and casting if tolerances can be held.  Electromagnetic energy propagation will be adversely affected by seams and gaps between the skin sections.  Efforts to minimize voids or gaps in the welding will result in better performance of the system.  Final machining of the outer and inner cone sections must not expose gaps between the skin sections or voids in the welds.  
2)	For illustrative purposes  there is a directory \pdf which contains PDF version of the drawings for initial analysis and review by the bidders it mirrors the directory structure of the actual drawings.   The AUTOCAD INVENTOR drawings (*.idw) in the \cfgs directory are the drawings which will be used as the baseline for determination of compliance with the specifications.  The contractor should consider purchase of an AUTOCAD INVENTOR license to ensure that they can correctly implement all the drawings contained on the CD attachment to the solicitation.

It is expected that selection of the proposal(s) and availability of funds would result in device and/or subsystem contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA.  Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide subsystems and devices consistent with the efforts synopsized for the LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential government, industry, and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, and availability of key personnel:   This criteria evaluates the proposer's relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included.  (2) Cost and schedule control:   This criteria evaluates the proposer's ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.  (3) Facilities:   This criterion evaluates the proposer's facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.  Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Darlene Pokora, Mail Stop 214, Building 1229, Room 120H, Hampton, VA 23681.  The preferred method of submission is via email to: &lt;d.c.pokora@larc.nasa.gov&gt;. The due date for submission is COB October 25, 2002. Procurement questions should be directed to Mary Jane Yeager, NASA LaRC Procurement Office, 757-864-2473, &lt;m.j.yeager@larc.nasa.gov&gt;. Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Jeffrey Herath (see below), or to Darlene C. Pokora at the email address noted above, phone # (757) 864-7511.  The technical requirements and NASA LaRC point of contact for technical questions is provided below:  Radiation Tolerant Intelligent Memory Stack (RTIMS) Technical Point of Contact: Mr. Jeffrey Herath, (757)864-1098, j.a.herath@larc.nasa.gov  The long-term objective of this effort is the development of a prototype device and demonstration of the effectiveness of an intelligent stacked memory array for enabling greatly enhanced on-orbit computing and data product generation capabilities. For this AIST program we propose to develop a working intelligent stacked memory array and demonstrate the feasibility of an eventual space-based mission via environmental testing.  Responses are solicited from potential AIST program partners who can demonstrate the capabilities and experience to design, manufacture and test heterogeneous chip stack devices.  In addition potential partners interested in reconfigurable computing applications are invited to respond. Selected partners will be expected to work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to perform some or all of the following tasks:   Design and manufacture the intelligent stacked memory array, RTIMS   Obtain suitable integrated circuits   Perform initial functional tests   Assist the integration of the device   Assist with environmental testing, evaluation and deviation resolution.  RTIMS General Description:      A stacked memory device providing 2 Gigabits of storage, organized in 16 bit words.  Each memory word will require 8 additional bits for Error Detection And Correction (EDAC).  The memory type should be Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) as most data will be written sequentially.  Further a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) (and any additional circuits required by the FPGA to start i.e., EEPROM) are also incorporated into the stack.  The FPGA design within the stack implements the control logic for using the SDRAMs as a general purpose bank of memory without worrying about selecting rows, columns, banks, refresh cycles and EDAC circuitry.  These functions are transparent to the user of the RTIMS.  The FPGA must be in stack reprogrammable.  NASA Langley will develop the FPGA code.  The FPGA selected will need to be equivalent in size to 32k gates of an Actel FPGA.  The RTIMS will need to be rated for 100K RAD (total dose) and be destructive latch-up immune.  Single Event Upsets (SEUs) will be corrected by EDAC and logged while dual upsets will be detected by EDAC and logged.  The height of the RTIMS should be 300 mils or less.

The technical requirements and NASA LaRC point of contact for questions is provided for each technology proposal:  1.  Aerocapture - Design, Fabrication and Test of Attached Inflatable Aerocapture Concepts Technical Point of Contact: James M. Corliss, 757-864-7627, j.m.corliss@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is actively developing aerocapture technologies for planetary exploration missions.  Specifically, NASA Langley is conducting conceptual designs and performance studies of inflatable drag devices to assist in the execution of a spacecraft's aerocapture maneuver.  Of particular interest are concepts for attached ballutes, their related ancillary systems, and the performance of ballute materials.  Langley is therefore seeking partners with which to conduct systems analyses and perform material tests in the study of an attached ballute system.  The partner(s) must work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to perform some or all of the following tasks:	Conduct concepts studies for attached, inflatable aerobrakes.  Characterize the aeroelastic performance of ballutes through analysis and/or testing.  Compare the performance of an entry vehicle with attached ballute to a vehicle using a traditional rigid aeroshell.  Partners selected under this synopsis will participate in the development of a proposal to the anticipated In-Space Propulsion Technologies, Cycle 2, ROSS 2002 NRA. 2.  Plasma Sails - Computational Studies of Fundamental Interactions and Processes Technical Point of Contact: James M. Corliss, 757-864-7627, j.m.corliss@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is developing analysis capabilities and methods for conducting computational studies related to predicting the performance and behavior of plasma sail propulsion systems.  Specifically, NASA Langley is developing capabilities to analyze the thermal response and thermal balance of plasma sails.  Langley is seeking partners with the additional computational capabilities required to more fully model and study the potential capabilities of plasma sail concepts.	Potential partner(s) must work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners, and have analytical capabilities in the following computational areas:	Kinetic and fluid computational models of solar wind interaction with an artificial magnetosphere with emphasis on system performance equilibrium conditions, and possible instabilities.  Computational studies of plasma sail fundamental processes such as plasma expansion of an artificial magnetosphere, plasma sources, self-consistent current generation, plasma losses, neutral interaction, and magnetic field production.  Global stability of artificial magnetospheres.  Langley is strongly interested in partners that have access to and experience in conducting laboratory investigations that would validate the plasma sail computational methods and analytical tools developed under this effort.   Partners selected under this synopsis will participate in the development of a proposal to the anticipated In-Space Propulsion Technologies, Cycle 2, ROSS 2002 NRA. 3. Integrated Solar Sail Diagnostics Package Technical Point of Contact: Mr. Richard S. Pappa, 757-864-4321, r.s.pappa@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners with which to develop extremely lightweight, unobtrusive, low-power sensors and data networks for in-space structural measurement of large area structures such as solar sails. Partners are also sought with expertise in membrane structural mechanics and dynamics, ground test methods for large thin-film membrane structures, photogrammetric analysis and simulation methods, and custom photogrammetry software development.   Structural parameters of interest for in-space measurement include deployment dynamics, deployed shape, deployed vibration properties, sail tension, sail film and boom stresses, sail temperature, and sail integrity. Measurement technologies include, but are not limited to, photogrammetry and videogrammetry, laser scanners or trackers, embedded fiber optic sensors, miniature local GPS networks, accelerometers, load cells, strain gages, and thermistors. Data networks include miniature wireless, fiber-optic, storage, and transmission technologies. Selected technologies will be integrated at NASA and used to test multiple 400 m2 ground test articles in the 2003-2005 timeframe. The measurement system must be evolvable to a mass of less than 2.0 Kg for in-space use on a 5000 m2 sail. Partners selected under this synopsis will participate in the development of a proposal to the anticipated In-Space Propulsion Technologies, Cycle 2, ROSS 2002 NRA. 4. Solar Sail Computational Modeling Technology Technical Point of Contact POC: Jonathan Ransom, 757-864-292, j.b.ransom@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is actively involved in solar sail development for the potential of providing cost effective, propellantless propulsion systems for future space explorations.  Large gossamer structures such as solar sails are often folded and packaged into a small volume for launching and then deployed in space using inflation deployment systems.  Existing ground-testing facilities are not adequate to replicate the space-environment of full-scale solar sails, necessitating ground-test correlation of deployment and on-orbit performance with analysis using sub-scale components.  Existing computational tools for deployment and shape characterization of solar sails are insufficient for these structures due to the slow analysis time and other computational challenges. Hence, the Center envisions developing high fidelity, advanced computational models and integrated multi-disciplinary analysis tools to provide detailed analytical predictions appropriate for ground-test, deployment, and on-orbit performance for solar sail missions.  Specifically, NASA plans to develop efficient analytical tools capable of predicting the shape and response of solar sails.  The Center is therefore seeking partners with which to develop advanced analysis technology to meet these needs.  The technologies solicited include (but are not necessarily limited to) finite element models and methodology, dynamic deployment simulation, software development and experimental testing.  Partners selected under this synopsis will participate in the development of a proposal to "In-space Propulsion Technologies" program element of the anticipated NASA Research Announcement entitled "Research Opportunities in Space Science (ROSS) 2002 Program".
