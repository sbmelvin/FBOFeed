<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase a Nexcelom Celigo Imaging Cytometer with 5 channels to enhance our studies on mitochondria and aging.</p>
<p>The assessment of cell viability and proliferation rate are standard cell culture techniques which are required for the thorough investigation of genotype and phenotype alterations in age-related research. Current technologies require the trypsinization and/or staining of cells with toxic chemicals, which perturbs their natural state and requires the use of a lot of materials (i.e. dishes, media, and drugs) because current techniques also consume an entire cell sample for one time-point. The Celligo will allow us to non-invasively monitor the same cells over time, with different treatments, without having to plate multiple duplicates for time course experiments. This will provide more accurate data with less reagent and materials used in numerous cell culture formats.  Moreover, we routinely assess mitochondrial function using the Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer. This requires a normalization step to account for the number of cells, to ensure the results are due to mitochondrial functional differences rather than differences in cell number or protein content. Current normalization techniques require cell lysis and protein determination, which is time consuming with a large degree of inherent variability. This method also assumes that there are no differences in total cellular protein content between treatment groups, which may not be the case, especially in experiments where proteins are overexpressed or knocked down for experimental purposes. Using the Celligo, we will be able to count the exact number of cells in each of the 96 wells before and after an experiment using the Seahorse. This will allow us to account for any loss of cells during the course of the experiment, as well as proper normalization per cell, without the need to make assumptions like the current protein content normalization approach. Overall, the Celligo provides a novel, non-invasive tool to more accurately assess and quantify critical cell functions while saving time and money in wasted reagents.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with id Quantique SA located at Chemin de la Marbrerie 3, Carouge GE, GE, 1227, Switzerland to purchase an upgrade to an existing Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscope (FLIM).
<p><br />NIST's Material Measurement Laboratory's Materials Measurement Science Division (MMSD) conducts research on the development of innovative metrologies and measurement protocols for micro/nano-scale heterosystems analysis. Measurement techniques are used to determine sample composition as well as structural, electronic, and chemical properties of a wide variety of organic, inorganic and biomolecular systems where materials of interest are typically present as either micro/nano-scale features or monolayer/multilayer films.</p>
<p><br />To meet mission requirements; the MMSD has a need for an Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscope (FLIM) system upgrade to an existing Id Quantique SA (Becker Hickl) system originally purchased under SB1341-13-SU-1241. These Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy components are an upgrade in terms of timing resolution to a materials screening platform used in the development of a super resolution imaging platform. Pursuant to this application, the upgrade to the detector and timing control system must be fully compatible with the ID Quantique (Becker Hickl) System to yield optimal imaging/temporal characteristics with this detector system with respect to the existing hardware, electronics and software. To maintain and improve the interoperability of the current system with the new system, NIST requires a 100% compatible upgrade for the existing system in terms of electrooptic and optomechanical coupling, computer control, and automation.</p>
<p><br />Therefore, the original equipment manufacturer, id Quantique SA, is the sole company who can provide these components with the required pin-to-pin compatibility to NIST.</p>
<p><br />Given these facts, id Quantique SA is the only source reasonably available to provide the required equipment.</p>
<p><br />The resulting purchase order will be a Firm-Fixed-Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 541715 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.</p>
<p><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 11:59 am EST 8/28/2018, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p><br />A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Brookhaven Instruments Corporation located at 750 Blue Point Road, Holtsville, NY 11742 to purchase a differential refractometer accessory for a laser light scattering accessory.
<p><br />The Materials Science and Engineering Division (MSED) is involved in the advancement of static and dynamic laser light scattering methods for the characterization of polymer solutions, networks and gels. The static polarized laser light scattering by dilute polymers in solvents quantify molecular (e.g. absolute mass-average molar mass and radius of gyration) and thermodynamic (e.g. second and third virial coefficient) properties. These methods are used routinely in the characterization of polymer solutions. In order to quantify the molecular and thermodynamic properties an independent measurement of the differential refractive index is required. An instrument that measures the differential refractive index increment in a batch-mode with manual sample loading and unloading and software analysis is required.</p>
<p><br />To meet current these mission requirement, the MSED needs to acquire a self-contained, batch-mode differential refractometer to measure the refractive index increment from polymer solution and solvent reference. This instrument must not require any additional hardware to operate and must be fully compatible with the NIST owned- Brookhaven BI-200SM (S/N 80480) goniometer-based light scattering instrument's hardware and software. Failure to purchase a compatible accessory would limit NIST's technical capabilities in characterization of absolute molecular mass through additional measurement corrections and assumptions. <br /><br /><br />Only the refractometer accessory from Brookhaven Instruments Corporation meets <br />NIST's minimum requirements.</p>
<p><br />Market research has shown that Brookhaven Instruments Corporation is the sole company who can provide this equipment to NIST.</p>
<p><br />Given these facts, Brookhaven Instruments Corporation is the only source reasonably available to provide the required equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm-Fixed-Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees.</p>
<p><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration.

National Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53295 (hereinafter called VA), intends to issue a sole source one year, with four one-year options contract to Roots Residential Adult Family Home LLC,  1815 LaSalle Street, Racine, Wisconsin 53402 (hereinafter called Roots) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8153   Sharing of Health-care Resources; and to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

The VA has an immediate need to contract with Roots for a VA beneficiary who currently resides at Roots.  The resident requires 2:1 male staff coverage for 16 hours per day and the remainder of the hours with 1:1 staff due to the resident s aggressive behavior.  The resident requires 2:1 staff coverage when outside of Roots.  The resident requires a private room due to mental health symptoms.  Roots provides Support Services:  bathing, dressing, food, financial management, shopping outings, court appointments, and transportation, etc.    

Proceeding with an award to any vendor other than Roots Residential Adult Family home would result in the veteran having a psychiatric episode. The consequences would be detrimental to the veteran s progress.  It is in the best interest of the veteran for the residency to remain unchanged.

Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes experience with emotionally disturbed/mental illness, certifications, State license, description of housing units, and costs for 24/7 support services (excluding room and board).  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  

Responses to this announcement must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than 1:00PM Central Time, April 13, 2018 to the following email address: Patrice.Bond@va.gov.  No other form of communication will be accepted.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) Office, Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA or BIE does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIE Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIE if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employee referred to IHS through the contract. Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being peformed under this contract if contractor is in contact with patients.</p>
<p>Peformance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (IHS). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) Adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at at I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questiionnaire Ivestigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their EQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the eQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract.

Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denail of access. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more that the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Award will be made to a small business concern that provides an acceptable technical approach at a price that is found to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>(ii) Technical Acceptability: Technical Acceptability will be evaluated to determine an overall rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable". This will be determined by evaluating the ability of the offeror to provide a sound, compliant approach that meets all requirements listed in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Attachments and Technical Exhibits and demonstrates a thorough knowledge and understanding of the requirements. It is the contractor's responsibility to ensure that their quote package clearly demonstrates their ability to perform these requirements. All offerors must provide the following minimum information and documentation with their quote package to be considered technically acceptable:</p>
<p>a. An approach for accomplishing work requirements identified in the PWS, with the appropriate personnel and equipment, at contract start date through expiration, to meet the Government's desired outcomes. The contractor shall include a project schedule. The schedule shall capture all PWS requirements and execution timelines. The written rationale shall describe coordination of work activities, phasing if applicable, and demonstrate an overview of how the project will be completed on time.</p>
<p>(iii) Past Performance: The Government may use information available from past government contracts and any information found using sources such as Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the<br />total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option<br />prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the<br />option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror<br />within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either<br />party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether<br />or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.
