3) The desired absolute accuracy is 10 MHz at 671 nm or better. 

4) For units requiring periodic calibration to an external frequency reference, a stabilized HeNe laser ( almost equal to 630 nm) may be assumed as the reference laser;

5)A built-in LCD output on the device is desired, but units requiring a connection to a computer via USB for display of output will also be considered;

6) External control of wave meter via USB

Warranty:
The vendor shall provide a minimum warranty period of one year.  Contractor shall state the warranty coverage provided for the equipment.

Technical capability shall be evaluated to determine the capabilities of the proposed equipment to meet or exceed the minimum required specifications as stated herein. Product literature shall be evaluated to determine that the proposed equipment will meet or exceed all of the Governments required minimum specifications as reflected herein. 

Under the technical capability factor, strongest consideration shall be given to equipment with the capabilities of exceeding the following minimum specifications:
   
1) The minimum measurable wavelength must be at least as low as 350 nm, but an extension as deep into the UV as possible is desirable;

2) The maximum measurable wavelength must be at least 900 nm, but an extension as deep into the near-infrared as possible is desirable;

3) The desired absolute accuracy is 10 MHz at 671 nm or better; better is desired;

PROJECT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE<BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), Northwestern Division, has sponsored biological studies concerning anadromous fish passage on the Columbia and lower Snake Rivers. These research, monitoring, and evaluation studies are managed under the Anadromous Fish Evaluation Program (AFEP), which is coordinated with Federal, State, and Tribal fish agencies throughout the region. These agencies, in turn, provide both scientific/technical and policy-level input to the Corps on study objectives, experimental designs, and methodologies. The main purpose of AFEP is to provide scientific information that will assist the Corps in making decisions regarding the safe passage of anadromous fish past the eight dams and reservoirs on the lower Columbia and Snake Rivers.  Each year, a forum is held to have the funded AFEP researchers present current year study results to the region.<BR>2.
