<DESC>Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Product Services Division, AML-4000, proposes to acquire by single source acquisition, Contractor Depot Logistics Support (CDLS) for the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) Critical and Essential Power Systems (ACEPS), National Exide/IPM Uninterruptible Power Systems (NEIUPS), the Dual Redundant Power Distribution System (DRPDS), and the Critical Redundant Power Distribution System (CRPDS).   This requirement also includes full maintenance and engineering support services for the older Exide and International Power Machine (IPM) UPSs of the National Exide/IPM Interruptible Power Systems (NEIUPS).  The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Eaton Corporation/CDLS, 8609 Six Forks Road, Raleigh, North Carolina, on a single source basis.  The contract will accommodate the requirement with a 1-year base and include four 1-year contract options periods, to be exercised at the discretion of the FAA.  
This procurement is considered to be single-source based on the conclusion, after market analysis, that Eaton is the only company with the knowledge and technical information needed to maintain and repair the current systems, as they are the only source of current proprietary documentation, engineering specifications, drawings to manufactured equipment and components including the software code required to maintain these systems in accordance with the FAA's requirement.  Eaton is the only vendor capable of providing changes, modifications, and upgrades to the ACEPS with minimal impact on equipment and schedules.  This is a follow-on contract to contract number DTFAAC-08-D-00003.
This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal. All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer, John Hawk, at e-mail address john.hawk@faa.gov or mailing address FAA, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Aviation, Medical & Training Division (AMQ-310), P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK  73125 by April 19th, 2012.

<DESC>THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: L-BAND.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of 13 rotary joint L-Band Beacons (P/N 21336/1) and 13 rotary joint L-Band Receivers (P/N 21337/1) in support of the Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR-4), manufactured by Kevlin Corporation.  
The FAA does not have specifications or drawings to allow for open market fabrication of identical units. Further, the ARSR-4 systems are under National Airspace System (NAS) configuration control.  Units from another manufacturer would not be identical to the Kevlin systems currently fielded; creating multiple logistical and financial burdens; such as field documentation changes, local NAS Change proposal approval though the NAS Configuration Control Board (CCB), specialized training to accommodate different units, depot level technician repair training, and purchase of repair documentation for in house repair.
Contractor must have access to the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) specifications and drawings.  Potential sources must provide documentation to the FAA showing proof for rights to use the data from the OEM.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.  Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA.
Interested parties who can comply with and meet all of the requirements called out in this market survey should respond with their documentation in writing to: Connie Houpt, connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.
Mark responses to this survey with Market Survey File #12-03466, to arrive by 2:00 p.m. CST, April 23, 2012.  
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Individual company responses will not be disclosed to other vendors.  This announcement is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.
This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Blvd. EPS Room 6074, Rockville, MD, 20852, UNITED STATES<br /><br /><strong>Description<br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) plans to procure on a sole source basis analysis of samples using Agilent mRNA and miRNA microarray from GenUs Biosystems, 1807 Janke Drive, Unit M, Northbrook, IL 60062 <br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $12.0 Million.<br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />Period of Performance shall be from award through one (1) month.<br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. <br /><br />CCR / ROB has had a long-standing interest in radiation modifiers, particularly on aspects of the stress response. Over the last 4 years, ROB has developed two themes that are now the focus of the program. This includes the concept of "fingerprinting" drugs using drug concentrations seen in the clinic and have demonstrated for COX-inhibitors (non-specific NSIADS, COX-2 specific and RNAi) there are substantial differences in gene expression among the high concentrations often used for mechanistic studies in the laboratory, the clinically achievable concentrations and RNA interference. Such discordance may account for some of the lack of translation of results from the lab to the clinic. The major emphasis builds on the concept of radiation as "focused biology" such that a radiation dose and schedule can be selected to induce a phenotypic change in the cancer cell such that the cancer is now susceptible to molecular targeted therapy. <br /><br />Initial work was already finished in PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells using mRNA and miRNA microarray analysis by GenUs Biosystems. The second part of the project is to do the microarray analysis with an in vivo model using TSA mouse breast carcinoma cells grown in syngenic mouse model. This particular project will enable the NCI to find radiation induced gene expression changes in tumors. <br /><br />GenUs is a company that provides full service gene expression analysis using the Agilent Bioarray technology. The company provides amplification of the RNA provided by the NCI laboratory, probe synthesis, hybridization to Agilent microarrys, scanning of the microarrays, and data analysis. This service offers several distinct advantages over other available services. GenUs is the only lab that the NCI is aware of that provides high performance microarray metrics for sensitivity, dynamic range, and reproducibility with extremely small amounts of starting material. In addition, the company is the only one to offer comprehensive data analysis, which is included in their price. The analysis is conducted using GeneSpring software, which is one of the leading microarray data analysis packages available today. They provide unlimited data consulting time for the data analysis, in whichever combination NCI requests, even after 3 months. This includes customized analysis and explanation of genomic data, data mining, integrated analysis of sequence and expression data, and cross-reference of public genomic databases. <br /><br />In order to be able to expand and complete the ongoing research using established treatments, the microarray analysis must be compatible with previous experiments. Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to current gene expression analysis being performed in the NCI laboratory.<br /><br /><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM EST, on April 26, 2012.

This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.<br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. <br /><br />The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is an intramural research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) that conducts population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a cancer which has one of the most highly skewed sex ratios of any malignancy with approximately 8 males being diagnosed for every single female. The known precursor metaplasia is Barrett's esophagus and this also is more prominent in men than women. Although increasing body mass index is associated with each of these two disease states, not all of the associations are thought to be explained by gastroesophageal reflux. Therefore, the NCI hypothesizes that sex steroid hormone metabolism may be involved in these mechanisms which increase the risk of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adencoarcinoma. The NCI will test this hypothesis in a sample of Barrett's esophagus patients compared with matched controls in the Barrett's Esophagus Early Detection Case Control Study (BEEDS). <br /><br />The contractor shall test a total of 408 samples and 20 controls for quantitation of the following sex steroid hormones and protein:<br /><br />i.

National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health-Clinical Brain Disorders Branch (CBDB), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Carlo Colantuoni, Ph.D., 713 West 36th Street, Baltimore, MD, 21211-2506, a Psychologist/Neuroscientist in the fields of genetics, biostatistics, and bioinformatics of normal control and patients suffering from complex neuropsychiatric illnesses. CBDB is investigating of the genetics of brain development across the lifespan through analyses of postmortem brain tissue. This continuation is part of a follow-up and an extension to pilot genetic analyses which was originally developed and performed by Dr. Colantuoni. He will fine-tune and perform noval data analyses on a large gene project to document genome-wide expression changes in postmortem human brain across the lifespan (from fetal age through age 80 years) on normal controls and subjects with various neuropsychiatric diagnoses.
<p>The period of performance will be for 6 months.</p>
<p>Dr. Colantuoni is highly skilled in the fields required to accomplish the goals in biostatistics, genomics and bioinformatics. In addition, he has had 4 years hands-on experience working specifically with human postmortem brain development research project analyzing postmortem human brain gene expression data. Dr. Colantouni has expertise in combining transcriptional and genetic analyses in human neural tissue to obtain and describe a global perspective on the role of the human genome in cortical development, function and ageing. Dr. Colantuoni has knowledge and a deep understanding of temporal dynamics relative to genetic control of transcriptional processes in postmortem human prefrontal cortex from fetal development through ageing as well as neurodegeneration. He has extensive prior experience in developing tools to analyze and demonstrate gene expression processes clearly and concisely to scientific and non-scientific audiences. The project requires experience in collection of gene expression data; microarray analyzes; quality control and normalization with global assessment of major gene effects; discovery of novel relevant genes, gene to gene correlations and functionally related gene groups/networks; and global analysis of transcriptional changes across the lifespan (fetal thru age 80).</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR Part 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<SUBJECT>Design/Build of North West Child Care Center
<SOLNBR>NIHOF2012475
<ARCHDATE>04272012
<CONTACT>Carol C. Lavrich, Phone 3014510026, Fax 3014021103, Email lavrichcc@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research Facilities (ORF), Office of Acquisition (OA) has a requirement for the construction of the Northwest Child Care Center (NWCCC) to be located in Bethesda, Maryland.<br />Description of Requirement
<p>The NWCCC shall be a new, freestanding structure providing additional campus-wide capacity for daytime childcare. The primary objective is to create a center that provides necessary facilities for a safe and effective learning environment that is conducive to the well being of the children. This new facility must provide a welcoming appearance with a design that encourages positive identification with the facility, respects children's needs and abilities, and permits them to develop their potential in a safe and enriching environment.<br />The NWCCC is intended to supplement the existing East Childcare Center as the need for daytime childcare has outgrown this existing facility. Additionally, new facilities at the northern portion of the NIH campus are needed to make childcare more convenient for parents who work in that area.</p>
<p>The center must have a licensed capacity to house up to 170 children, and be of approximately 21,000 gross square feet (15,274 net assignable square feet), and include complete site development (demolition and new construction) for parking facilities, utilities connections, building services, loading and receiving access, landscape features, pedestrian-ways (sidewalks), site lighting, security features, and functional playground suitable for certification (provide minimum required playground equipment).<br />The new facility must comply with NIH design guidelines and physical security criteria, GSA Childcare Center Design Guide, Code of Maryland ( Subtitle 16, Chapters 01-19, Child Care Centers ), governing fire safety and building codes, and must meet NAEYC accreditation.<br />The contractor shall be responsible for delivering a project that is LEED accredited/certified and provides sustainable features to achieve flexibility, energy efficiency, for quality of environment. This NWCCC facility must qualify for LEED Silver rating, coordinated and obtained by the contractor.</p>
<p>Procurement strategy</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR Subpart 15.3, NIH will employ source selection tradeoff procedures to procure and award the construction contract for this project. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly greater than cost or price. This is a Two Phase Design Build Selection Procedure in accordance with FAR 36.303-1(b). The selection process will have two phases. Phase I, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), shall result in the establishment of a list of offerors identified as Viable Competitors, who will be invited to participate in the next stage of the procurement, Phase II. Phase II, Request for Proposals (RFP), shall result in the selection of the construction contractor whose offer provides the Government with the best value. <br /><br />In Phase I, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that are critical to this procurement and that will serve as the basis for the determination of the viable competitors. Interested offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each offeror in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the RFP or, based on the information submitted in the RFQ response that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. Notwithstanding this advice, an offeror that is unlikely to be a viable competitor may participate in Phase II of the procurement. Offerors that did not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase I will not be allowed to participate in Phase II of the procurement. After evaluating Phase I proposals, the Government shall select the most highly qualified offerors, not to exceed three (3).<br /><br /><br />In Phase II, the Government will issue the RFP to the viable competitors and the other offerors from Phase I that elect to participate in Phase II. The RFP will serve as the basis for the firm-fixed price offers from the offerors in Phase II. The firm-fixed price offers will be due by the date established in the RFP. Based on the Phase I and Phase II submissions, the Government shall select the offer that reflects the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase I and Phase II offers without discussions.</p>
<p>Any resulting contract will be firm fixed price. NAICS Code: 236220 with a size standard of $33.5 million. It has been determined that competition will be limited to eligible 8(a) firms located within the geographical area serviced by the Washington DC Metropolitan and Baltimore District Offices, and other eligible 8(a) construction firms with a bona fide place of business located within the geographical competitive area per 13 CRF &sect;124.507. All other 8(a) participants are deemed ineligible to submit offers.</p>
<p><br />Magnitude of Construction is between $10 million and $25 million.</p>
<p>All responders are advised that this project may be cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation and final award. All contractors are advised that they must be registered, by the time of Phase 1 submissions, in CCR and ORCA (http://orca.bpn.gov). Joint ventures must also be registered in CCR and ORCA as a joint venture. We advise contractors to begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure this registration is in place should they be selected for the award. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.<br /><br /><br />One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements. <br /><br />The procurement is an 8(a) competitive set aside for the local area of Metropolitan Washington DC and Baltimore District Offices of the Small Business Administration per FAR&nbsp;19.804-3(d).&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>EPA has a requirement to integrate its water quality data with other relevant data sources, including but not limited to USGS NWIS stream gage values, National Hydrography Dataset and the Canadian equivalent (NHN) stream network features, NOAA National Weather Service forecasts and snow levels in the US and Canada, GeoConnections-Natural Resources Canada and Environment Canada federal and provincial stream gage and water quality sources.  Integration with the Canadian data is essential for efficiently measuring water quality and quantity within the Great Lakes Basin.  Establishing a sole source contract with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC?) is in EPA?s best financial interest to meet these requirements.  OGC is the only standard setting organization able to fulfill these requirements based on its organizational model, and because critical cross US and Canada water resource Agencies are already participating members.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY.  THE ACTUAL SOLICITATION SHALL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD ON OR ABOUT APRIL 27, 2012, AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE:  http://epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Water (OW), Office of Science and Technology (OST), Engineering and Analysis Division (EAD) requires contractor support to provide environmental engineering support for clean water regulations.  Specifically, the contractor will be required to provide support in the following areas:  technical and analytical support; cost and benefit analysis; programmatic support including document preparation; review of public comments and peer review; litigation technical support; database management; support in chemical analytical methods and toxicity tests relating to the requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and other related mandates; multimedia analysis; and implementation of effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) and standards including compliance and enforcement to the OW/OST/EAD in support of the Agency's requirements relative to the provisions of the CWA.  This environmental engineering support is expected to i nclude professional program managers, engineers, scientists, technicians and administrative services with experience in CWA regulations, industrial wastewater treatment and monitoring and pollution prevention technologies.  
Due to the nature of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements, it is anticipated that Offerors with the expertise to perform these services could also have relationships (including a parent/subsidiary/sister company affiliation or an existing contract relationship) which presents a potential significant organizational conflict of interest (OCOI).  It is the EPA?s contention that a significant OCOI would exist if award were to be made to entities within the following groups:
1)  Entities that discharge processed water, or provide treatment of wastewater or drinking water; 2)  Entities that manufacture/sell/import water treatment chemicals and/or equipment (including point-of-use/point-of-entry treatment devices);3)  Entities that provide advisory and/or technical services relating to waste minimization, waste management, and wastewater treatment and control;  4)  Entities acting in a consulting, advisory, or legal capacity with, or for, organizations trying to overturn or circumvent the regulations which are the intended outcome of this contract; and/or 5)  Entities that own or operate industrial and/or community water systems. 
The solicitation shall also include the clause entitled LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (LOFC) (Headquarters Support), (EPAAR 1552.209-74) (APR 2004), (Alt V).  Paragraph (c) which states in part, ?The contractor and any subcontractors, during the life of this contract plus five years beyond the life of this contract, shall be ineligible to enter into business or financial relationships which would support or affect any efforts to contest, oppose, or influence the contents of regulations, policies, limitations, standards or criteria relating to the Clean Water Act (CWA); the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1986 (CERCLA); the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); or the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1988 (FIFRA), for which it has provided, is providing, or has work assignments to provide technical and administrative  support under this contract, without prior written authorization from the cognizant EPA contracting officer.?  Be advised, however, that the afore-mentioned limitations may change when the RFP is released.
The Government anticipates award of a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract with a total level of effort of 250,000 hours (if all option quantities are exercised) over an ordering period of five (5) years.  The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $14 million.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available on or about April 27, 2012, on the Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) Contracts website located at http://epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/ (under Solicitations and Amendments) with a closing date on or about May 31, 2012.  Anticipated award date of the resultant contract is no later than September 26, 2012.  Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the solicitation for changes or updates.  
A Draft PWS document and a Draft Non-EPAAR Clauses document shall accompany this Presolicitation Notice via separate attachment.  See http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/ (under Synopses-RFPs Not Issued) for this entire presolicitation package.  Be advised that changes to any or all documentation is possible when the final RFP is released.  No hard copies will be available.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to comply with the synopses and presolicitation notice requirements of FAR 5.2 - Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. Any solicitation resulting from this notice will be handled in accordance with FAR 5.102(d); therefore, availability of any resulting solicitation package will be limited to this electronic medium. Accordingly, interested vendors, especially small business, are encouraged to register themselves as an interested vendor.
<p>Subject to the availability of funds, the United States Agency for International Development Mission to the Philippines (USAID/Philippines) intends to issue a request for proposals (RFP) in order to select a contractor to implement the Enhancing Governance, Accountability and Engagement (ENGAGE) Project, a five-year project designed to contribute to improving peace and stability through the promotion of good governance in six targeted conflict-affected areas of Mindanao by addressing challenges that permit continued social and economic instabilities and marginalization. The project seeks to promote community empowerment as a foundation for inclusive local governance in the six areas.</p>
<p>The contractor will have ultimate responsibility for managing the contract, for achieving the performance results in the activity areas, and for determining the appropriate staffing pattern in support of its technical approach. The contractor must assemble a team with the required knowledge and experience in the components mentioned below. The core team should be composed of long-term international and Philippine professionals with expertise and experience in addressing local governance issues, particularly issues related to strengthening local governments, supporting civil society, and implementing civic education in a variety of settings. The core long-term team can be supplemented by local and/or international short-term consultants to provide various types of technical assistance. Experience in strengthening governance and civil society in conflict and/or post-conflict environments is a plus.</p>
<p>The ENGAGE project will consist of two main interrelated tasks:</p>
<p>1. Strengthening the capacity, legitimacy, and transparency and accountability of local governments; and</p>
<p>2. Increasing the involvement of youth and adults in governance processes through civic education, civil society strengthening and the promotion of mechanisms for participation.</p>

In order to accurately characterize the region's traffic conditions and perform the required traffic impact analysis, USACE determined that a dynamic traffic model would be required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Static models, which are more commonly employed for transportation analyses, were not considered robust enough for accurately capturing secondary and tertiary traffic impacts in a dense, urban environment such as Chicago.<br /><br />RST International is the only known technical service firm with the capabilities to develop a high quality DynusT model at the scale of the GLMRIS project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>RST International is the developer and sole patent owner of the intellectual proprietary user-interface for the DynusT model known as DynuStudio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The DynuStudio platform provides enhanced modeling functionality, which will result in a higher quality product, and reduce the cost for the USACE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the significance and expected public scrutiny of the GLMRIS project, it is extremely crucial for the analysis do be performed by expert level modelers such as RST International.<br /><br />The award of this proposed fixed price services contract is critical to execute the mission for the GLMRIS study. Therefore, the government cannot afford any delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements since the GLMRIS study faces extremely tight deadlines and immense public pressure.<br /><br />This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers, proposals, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, interested firms may send a capabilities statement NO LATER THAN 4:00 p.m. CDT on 27 April 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Statements should be sent to the attention of Ryan E.

<DESC>This proposed contract action is for a service in which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source, Barbara Stanley, Ph.D., of Columbia University under the authority Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (a)(2) only one responsible source, 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).    The requirement is to develop training materials on how to administer the SAFE VET intervention and training VA personnel and community Emergency Department staff in delivering the intervention.  Training materials and interventions will be based on the protocols developed by the University of Rochester, University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University under contract to the VA. Materials will include: The development of a training DVD on safety planning and follow-up for distribution within the VA and to community EDs for community-based Veterans. The completion of training materials for the Acute Services Coordinators with instructions to train ED staff in delivering the intervention including; identification and referral of Veterans. Work with evaluation control sites to implement evaluation portion of SAFE VET. Conduct a feasibility/acceptability evaluation of SAFE VET utilizing qualitative methods.  Finalize a structured interview for key informant staff and Veterans to determine acceptability of the SAFE VET intervention. Conduct outreach with community ED providers and interview these providers to determine what they see as special needs of suicidal Veterans and issues with accessing VA services. SAFE VET is a clinical demonstration project that is a collaboration between VA and Community Emergency Departments to identify, assess and provide safety planning and clinical follow-up for suicidal Veterans. The initial SAFE VET project developed a protocol for implementing and assessing safety planning and follow-up for Veterans until they receive recommended psychiatric outpatient treatment.  Barbara Stanley, Ph.D., Columbia University, one of the developers of the SAFE VET project, is working with Gregory K. Brown, Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania and Glenn Currier, M.D. at the University of Rochester to develop and test training materials for the SAFE VET intervention for Veterans presenting at VA and community emergency services for suicide or suicidal behavior. The clinical demonstration project consists of: a) developing a comprehensive manual for the Acute Services Coordinators on how to administer the SAFE VET intervention, b) test and implement rating form for adherence to the intervention c) collaborate with Employee Education Services to develop a DVD of didactic and interview of safety planning intervention adapted to the ED and urgent care settings. Dr. Stanley is unique in her ability to carry out this important project as she has already created a VA ED Safety Planning Manual in 2008 that is used in EDs across the VA. She is recognized as a national expert in suicide prevention program development. Dr. Stanley developed the Columbia University Suicide Severity Rating Scale that has considerable evidence from diverse settings of its effectiveness as a suicide assessment tool. She currently is an investigator in a study of suicide rating scales in EDs that is funded by the American Association for Suicide Prevention. Methods for data sharing and analysis are already being developed, and this will greatly facilitate producing these training materials in a timely manner.  This contract will be a continuation of Dr. Stanleys work in the VA on SAFE VET, which is now implemented in five VA Emergency Department sites.  Dr. Stanley is also the lead investigator on a study of the qualitative variability in implementation of the SAFE VET intervention at different VA facilities.

<DESC><p>The contractor shall provide services in support of the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) revised Circular No. A-123, Appendix A (A-123) review of internal controls over financial reporting within CMS.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses on the GSA Schedule 520-13, FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS SOLUTIONS (FABS), (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide assistance in the assessment of CMS' Internal Controls in compliance with OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A, and provide support for CMS' annual Assurance Statement on Internal Controls to the DHHS.</p>
<p>History:</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) management is responsible for developing and maintaining effective internal control to achieve effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The CMS is the nation's largest health insurer and has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that each dollar spent for benefits and/or administration of its programs is spent in the best interest of beneficiaries and the American taxpayers. <br />The OMB issued a revised Circular No. A-123, Management's Responsibility for Internal Control, dated December 21, 2004, which was effective beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2006. Appendix A of the revised A-123 requires the heads of certain federal agencies to annually document and assess internal controls over financial reporting (ICOFR) and report the results in a management assurance statement similar to that required of publicly-traded companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Appendix A provides a framework for management's use to document, assess, and report on conclusions reached in evaluating an agency's ICOFR. Given the magnitude of the CMS outlays (approximately $767.4 billion in FY 2011); it is imperative for management to have effective internal controls over financial reporting.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this potential action is to perform an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123 review of CMS' (Central and Regional Offices, Data Centers, Shared System Maintainers, and Medicare contractors) internal controls over financial reporting following the guidance set forth by OMB and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).</p>
<p><br />Task Descriptions:</p>
<p>The contractor shall:<br />&bull; Prepare and/or enhance the documentation of the CMS (including CMS contractors, and other CMS contractors such as Retiree Drug Subsidy, and the Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Contractor (MSPRC)) internal control processes used in financial reporting, including documentation of the financial reporting process and process level controls over financial reporting.</p>
<p>&bull; Identify the key controls at CMS, CMS contractors, Shared System Maintainers, and data centers that need to be evaluated and develop detailed review protocols for each area.</p>
<p>&bull; Perform testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting at CMS, CMS contractors, Shared System Maintainer, and data centers, and identify any deficiencies in accordance with Appendix A of OMB Circular A-123.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop Control Deficiency Logs (CDLs) and Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) for all identified issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop electronic work papers that shall provide sufficient detail to enable an experienced reviewer having no previous connection to the review to understand from the review documentation the nature, timing, extent, and results of the review procedures performed; the review evidence obtained; and its source and the conclusions.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide support to the CMS financial statement audit in order to minimize duplication of efforts, and create a more efficient review and audit process. Activities will include, but not be limited to, coordinating on-site activities to include CFO auditor participation/observation (i.e. activities such as planning, scoping, testing approach, walkthroughs of processes, documentation, and testing), making A-123 work papers and copies available, responding to audit questions, and attending meetings to discuss A-123 and CFO topics.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>In order to respond to this notice, contractors must be able to indicate experience and/or the ability to provide all of the bulleted points below. Please provide enough detail so your response clearly indicates that you can provide the following:</p>

<SOLNBR>iesre120002
<RESPDATE>051412
<ARCHDATE>05152012

<DESC><br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO PROPOSALS ARE SOUGHT.
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Department of Education (the Department) intends to make a sole source award to the National Academy of Sciences, located in Washington, DC.<br />The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) began in the 1960's with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation. The goals of the NAEP are to compare student achievement in states and other jurisdictions and to track changes in achievement of fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-graders over time in the following subject areas: mathematics, reading, science, writing, the arts, civics, economics, geography, and U.S. history. Student performance data is reported by state using the achievement levels of Basic, Proficient, and Advanced to categorize student performance. Stakeholders use NAEP data to track student performance in their jurisdiction, and to inform their decisions related to education reform. <br />Today, NAEP is a federally managed program that has moved from the pencil-and-paper testing format to a computer-based testing format. All NAEP assessments are administered uniformly across the nation and are conducted annually.<br />Legislative Authority</p>
<p>This action is designed to facilitate compliance with the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002, P.L. 107-279, Title III, Section 301.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is seeking an independent, outside evaluation of the NAEP's achievement levels. The NCES needs this evaluation to provide the Commissioner for Education Statistics with information to determine whether the achievement levels (i.e., the achievement levels of Basic, Proficient, and Advanced) used in reporting NAEP results "are reasonable, valid, and informative to the public" or whether the achievement levels should remain as "trial". Previous studies and reviews of NAEP achievement levels have yielded inconclusive results and expressed concerns over the standard setting methodologies used to establish current achievement levels.</p>
<p>We intend to award a sole source contract to the National Academy of Sciences if no other responsible and capable sources are identified through this synopsis. If other alternative sources are identified, the Department will move forward with a full and open competition.</p>
<p>Sources Sought</p>
<p>The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 6.302-1. The Department will afford qualified and interested parties an opportunity to submit capability statements outlining experience directly relevant to this requirement. The Government will consider information received within 30 days of this synopsis.</p>
<p>Draft Statement of Work (DSOW): Attached for your review is a Draft Statement of Work, which includes background, purpose of contract, legislative authority, scope of work, and tasks and deliverables.<br />Capabilities: In order to successfully perform the work of this contract, interested parties must have ALL of the following competencies or the ability to provide all of these competencies: (Contractor must respond to all the following points by indicating your experience or the ability to provide the experience.)<br /><br />1. Conduct expert, independent evaluations related to K-12th grade education;<br />2. Make valid conclusions that meet the purpose of proposed evaluations and present results to inform policy-making decisions; <br />3. Meet applicable professional standards required of the research field; and<br />4. Have prior experience related to standard setting methodologies. <br /><br />If the Department decides to move forward with a full and open competition for this requirement, a firm-fixed-priced contract will be awarded to the successful offeror. At this time, this synopsis is issued to assist the agency in performing market research to determine whether there are qualified and capable sources to provide the aforementioned services. Interested sources are requested to submit a response to Jennifer.Arthur@ed.gov by May 14, 2012 2:00 PM EST. Late responses will not be considered. Additionally, responses should include recent (within the past three years or work that is on-going) and relevant experience (work similar in type and scope) to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact, and labor rates. For points of contact, we request telephone numbers where the responder performed the relevant work. Marketing brochures and/or generic company literature will not be considered. Not addressing all the requested information may result in the Government determining the responder is not capable of performing the scope of work required. No additional information regarding any potential future RFP or Government requirements will be provided during this market research.</p>
<p>Requested Information</p>
<p>Interested vendors are requested to submit a maximum 5-page statement of their knowledge, experience, and capabilities to perform the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Conducting independent evaluations of government-funded programs;<br />&bull; Conducting standard-setting evaluations;<br />&bull; Experience with standardized national assessments measuring student academic achievement;<br />&bull; Establishing panels comprised of subject matter experts;<br />&bull; Convening two to five work group meetings per year;<br />&bull; Facilitating discussions with the goal to encourage committee members to reach consensus; and<br />&bull; Make valid conclusions that meet the purpose of proposed evaluations and present results to inform policy-making decisions.</p>
<p>The draft SOW is included with this notice. The Department encourages comments and feedback from capable and interested vendors to the draft SOW, including comments and feedback to improve the scope of work, proposed methodology, and recommend possible contract arrangements for consideration. Please limit feedback and comments to 5 pages.</p>
<p>Instructions for Responding to this Notice</p>
<p>Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal RFPs. The use of information received in response to this notice may be used by the Department of Education (ED) for acquisition planning and solicitation preparation activities. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. ED will not critique the responses to this notice and the notice should not be used by Offerors to market their products/services. ED does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with responding to this synopsis. Proprietary information is neither sought nor desired by ED. If such information is submitted, it must clearly be marked "proprietary" on every sheet containing such information, and the proprietary information must be segregated to the maximum extent practicable from other portions of the response (e.g., use an attachment or exhibit).</p>
<p>The Department will entertain questions through 12 PM, Eastern Time, Wednesday April 25, 2012. Questions will not be accepted after this date. Please submit questions via email to Jennifer.Arthur@ed.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Media Activity (DMA) Contracting Office-Riverside CA, is seeking potential sources that are capable of providing a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Shipboard Video Server System in support of DMA Afloat Media Services. The NAICS code for this requirement is 334220 - Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing, and the small business size standard is 750 employees. Services to be provided for this effort are the following:
<p>Shipboard Information Training and Entertainment (SITE) systems provide for closed-circuit television (CCTV) program playback aboard U.S. Navy, Military Sealift Command, and U.S. Coast Guard ships. The program content includes command information and public service announcements, military and technical training, copyright protected commercial movies, and programming derived from the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) satellite network. The present generation SITE systems use the standard 8-millimeter (mm) videotape format, which has reached the end of its supportable life-cycle. The Government has chosen encrypted digital versatile disc (NDVD) and hard disc drive (HDD) to replace the 8-mm videotape format as described in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS).<br />The purpose of this PWS is to define the government's requirements for the delivery of a COTS Video File Server System to play back encrypted motion picture content and non-encrypted programming material provided by the Navy. The PWS defines a Video File Server System that will be installed in SITE systems aboard U.S. Navy ships on an ongoing basis due to ship movements. Some components of this system will be used as stand-alone items to support SITE systems in very small ships and at land-based facilities in support of the Government's SITE-TV program.</p>
<p>Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less, following the format in the PWS, indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Interested and qualified sources should provide the following information: (1) company name, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, type of business and size; (2) a list of your most recent and relevant DoD or commercial contracts (not to exceed five) to include brief description, names, POCs, phone numbers, value &amp; type of contract, and period of performance; and (3) information about your company and your capabilities of performing this service.</p>
<p>This is a sources sought notice. It is not a solicitation for offers. This notice is issued for market research purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or commitment to issue an RFP; however, the Government reserves the right to issue a solicitation based upon its needs and the result of this sources sought notice. It is anticipated that a Requirements type contract with a base plus 2 options years will be awarded should the Government decide to proceed with this procurement. An estimated quantity of 50 servers per year is anticipated, and vendors should be able to deliver the first server within 90 days after contract award.</p>
<p>The Government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with the information provided in response to this sources sought notice. Acknowledgement of receipt will not be made. Submittals will not be returned to the sender. Responses should be submitted to Ms. Susan Madrid, susan.madrid@dma.mil no later than 03 May 2012.</p>

<DESC>Contract No. AG-03R6-C-12-0011 for the Refinement of the Radio Repeater Website was awarded to GCS Research, LLC (GCS), Missoula, MT for $60,000.00.
<p>The radio repeater Remote Site Monitoring (RSM) database is a proprietary spatial database built by GCS on the Microsoft SQL Server. The database was a custom implementation to support spatial queries and display thru Esri's ArcGIS for Server map service without being tied to Esri's Spatial Data Extension (SDE). It allows for the implementation of the monitoring and health rules required by the application to display the current radio state for each level of display.<br />The data exchange mechanism between the radio RSM database and RSM systems is a proprietary system developed by GCS to facilitate the capture of radio RSM data and migrate the appropriate information into database format.</p>
<p>MTDC needed to add more modules to the website to make it more useful for the Forest Service. It was determined that only GCS could add the modules and enhancements to the current website. Any other vendor would have to have GCS's consent/release of the proprietary geospatial display, database; and data transfer.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is providing the largest amount of resources for a single disease in history, and seeks to expand prevention, treatment and care to millions of HIV-affected people worldwide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Over the past eight years, it employed a multifaceted approach to combating HIV/AIDS in more than 100 countries around the world. The first five year goals were to treat 2 million HIV-infected individuals, prevent 7 million new infections and provide care and support for 10 million HIV-infected and affected individuals and orphans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In July 2008, the President of the United States signed into law a bill which re-authorized PEPFAR for five more years (2009-2013), increasing the commitment to $39 billion for PEPFAR HIV/AIDS programs and U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and UNAIDS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The new 10-year goals are: treatment for at least 3 million people; prevention of 12 million new infections; and care for 12 million people, including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To meet these goals, PEPFAR plans are to support training of at least 140,000 new health care workers in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Global AIDS Coordinator based in Washington, reports directly to the Secretary of State and oversees and directs all U.S. Government (USG) international HIV/AIDS activities in all departments and all agencies of the U.S. federal government. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) also coordinates with non-USG stakeholders host-country governments and multi-lateral institutions such as the World Bank, World Health Organization, Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS),- in order to strengthen the coordinated global effort to fight the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In Guyana, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID/Guyana) is an integral partner in the PEPFAR initiative and plays a key role in the joint USG, Government of Guyana, NGO, and other national and international efforts to combat HIV/AIDS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In partnership with the Guyana Ministry of Health (MOH), the USAID PEPFAR program currently focuses on prevention, treatment, care and support in order to strengthen public health systems, and enhance the government, civil society and private sector responses to HIV and AIDS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Principal activities focus on reducing HIV transmission, mitigating the impact of HIV-related illness and strengthening the health system. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Present program priorities to reduce HIV transmission include:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>prevention programming that ensures safe motherhood, targeted approaches for most-at-risk populations, and promotes counseling and testing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Comprehensive care and support programs focus on improving the quality of life of persons living with HIV and their family members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, USAID activities designed to strengthen the overall health system include developing health information systems and promoting data use for decision making, improving health commodity management systems, and building health care worker capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS and other diseases and conditions that impact the health of Guyanese.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The PEPFAR program in Guyana is going through a critical stage insofar as after years of substantial and growing support, the program's 2012 budget has been slashed and all USG agencies will be required to strategically cut back on the support they provide. USAID, the major recipient of funding and managing the largest portfolio of activities, will have to take a leadership role in reshaping the entire program. Another change involves the guidance from OGAC that country programs need to move to a strategy of sustainability in the near future as the resources decline. Because Global Health Initiative (GHI) funds are not available to Guyana, the budget cuts place even more pressure on the country to adopt the policy framework to take aboard the substantial programming of HIV/AIDS activities that accrued since 2003. This financial burden is a significant national budget issue for Guyana and will require close coordination with the Ministry of Finance. Finally, the USAID Personal Service Contractor will be the most senior USAID official in-country to manage this very complex and difficult process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">USAID, in its support to these programs, has entered into eight (8) separate agreements (contracts and grants) with NGOs, universities, private contractors and international organizations requiring extensive knowledge about contracting to support the achievement of its goals. These agreements are:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">1)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contract to implement the Guyana HIV/AIDS Reduction and Prevention Project (GHARP II), an approximate US$ 8M project, focused on providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Health and civil society partners in the delivery and implementation of HIV prevention, care and support programs. Under this contract, Management Sciences for Health is the Prime Partner, and Howard Delafield International and AIDS Health Care Foundation are sub-partners. This contract ends in December 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There may be a follow-up project to this activity depending upon the availability of FY 2012 funds which would require the USPSC to develop a Request For Applicaion and oversee the entire procurement process, in close coordination with the Regional Contracting Office in USAID/Dominican Republic...</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">2) Contract for Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) project, an approximately US$ 2 million annual activity, to undertake procurement, warehousing, information systems and distribution of critical HIV/AIDS treatment and clinical management commodities. This contract ends in September 2013 but will likely continue depending on the availability of funding. 3)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Agreement with Measure Evaluation for strategic information support for capacity building at the Ministry of Health (MOH) which totals approximately US$ 400,000 annually, and ends September 30, 2012. 4)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A contract to implement a one-year safe injection project, valuing US$ 300,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This contract commenced September 7, 2011 and will end on September 6, 2012.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">5) A grant with UNICEF supports the Childcare and Protection Agency of the Ministry of Human Services to develop safety nets for the protection of all children, including orphans and vulnerable children, through the establishment of legislation, a foster care program, and a legal aid system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This grant valued at $350, 000<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>will end on January 13, 2012.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">6)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A grant with the Pan American Health Organization (approximately US$ 400,000) supports Health Systems Strengthening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Project implementation is expected to commence September 2012. 7) A contract with a local Guyanese organization at approximately US$ 2 million annually, which provides financial and administrative management support to 14 local non-governmental organizations, which provide prevention, care and support services for persons infected and affected by HIV/AIDS at the community level..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The end date of this contract is January 2013.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">8) A contract with John Hopkins University to implement a US$ 200, 000 (annually) cervical cancer screening and treatment program to HIV positive women and high risk groups.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This contract ends September, 2012.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">9) A new contract is espected to be started in the next two months called Powering Health in Guyana which is designed to improve health facility infrastructure and reduce energy costs. It will continue for at least one year.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">II.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE POSITION</strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The U.S. Personal Services Contractor (USPSC) Health Officer is responsible for the successful achievement of the U.S. Government's (USG) HIV/AIDS portfolio in Guyana. The USPSC's major responsibilities as the principal officer representing USAID in the health sector in Guyana are to serve as the Health Team Leader, and work closely with the Ministry of Health, NGOs, other national and international agencies, contractors and grantees, and other program partners to facilitate and monitor the final design and effective implementation of the portfolio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The USPSC Health Officer serves as a member of the USAID/Guyana staff and reports directly to the USAID/Guyana Acting Mission Director.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Following <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>closure of the USAID/Guyana Mission in September 2012, the USPSC will report to the USAID/Barbados and Eastern Caribbean Mission Director. Until that occurs, this position has direct supervisory responsibility for two Foreign Service National (FSN) employees. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Once the Guyana Mission closes, s/he will oversee one FSN technical employee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the health team leader, the USPSC is expected to be fully knowledgeable about <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>PEPFAR, GHI, Global Fund and USAID regulations and strategies, policies, reports, communications, and procedures .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The USPSC Health Officer will lead in coordinating the strategic restructuring of US Embassy activities as their funding is reduced and perhaps eventually eliminated and enter into a significant policy dialogue in conjunction with senior officials from USAID/Barbados and Eastern Caribbean and the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown to encourage the Government of Guyana to find space in its national budget to continue the essential HIV/AIDS activities being funded by a variety of USG agencies. The USPSC will be the lynchpin in development of the policy framework to be developed and negotiated and serve the key interlocutor between the USG and the Government of Guyana on Health Sector policy and the sustainability of HIV/AIDS programs and activities.. Among the other partners that the USPSC will be working with <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>are (but are not limited to) the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Finance, National AIDS Programme Secretariat, Health Sector Development Unit, UN agencies, the Global Fund and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>its Country Coordination Mechanism and Secretariat, other USG and bilateral and multilateral agencies, and national and international NGOs, community-based organizations and foundations.</p>

This will include giving speeches and writing speeches and talking points for others.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The USPSC Health Officer also acts as the primary point of contact for USAID activities under the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR), through collaboration with other US government agencies to jointly design, plan and implement all US-funded HIV/AIDS programs in Guyana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The two major USG agencies working in HIV/AIDS in Guyana are USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with active participation of the Peace Corps, Military Liaison Office of the Department of Defense, Department of Labor, and the State Department.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the integrated nature of the PEPFAR program, the USPSC will be in charge of ensuring effective interagency collaboration, and strong linkages with the Government of Guyana, civil society, the private sector, and other national and international bodies working on HIV/AIDS and related areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be essential for the USPSC Health Officer to demonstrate strong technical and management skills, complemented by outstanding negotiating, communication and interpersonal skills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Donor collaboration is a critical, vital function of this position.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought/Request for Information-Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Design-Bid-Build (D-B-B) Construction and Design-Build (D-B) Construction, Okinawa, Japan.  This is a market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  This is not a solicitation for proposals.  The Government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this market survey.  The U.S. Army Engineer District-Japan is planning to solicit a MATOC for D-B-B and D-B construction to support U.S. Government facilities in Okinawa.  Any solicitations pursued are intended for local sources only.  Local sources are those sources normally resident and licensed to conduct business in Japan.  A MATOC is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract for construction services with multiple awardees.  Actual work is awarded through the issuance of task orders.  Multiple awardees generally compete with each other for task orders.  There are some exceptions to this rule, whereby competition may be reduced or task orders are issued non-competitively to one contract holder.  The Government anticipates award of up to three contracts under each MATOC to experienced sources capable of performing a wide range of D-B-B and D-B construction projects including, but not limited to:  grading, water lines, sewer lines, paving/repaving roadways, painting, roofing, renovation of interiors of existing buildings, new building construction, structural construction, Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and components, refrigeration systems, fire suppression systems, fuel pipeline and storage systems, power and services supplies, distribution and utilization systems (including lighting), power generators and Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPS), public address systems, fire alarm systems, telephone systems, asbestos, lead based paint, and petroleum-contaminated material abatement and disposal.  Each MATOC will consist of a one-year base period and three (3) one-year option periods.  The total maximum amount the Government will order under all three contracts combined is the not-to-exceed- amount of 800,000,000 Japanese YEN per period.  The guaranteed minimum amount for each contract s base period and each option period exercised is 400,000 Japanese YEN.  A performance bond will be required for individual task order that is over the Japanese YEN equivalent of $150,000.  Therefore, the Government intends to require contractors to demonstrate bonding capacity of 800,000,000 Japanese YEN.  The minimum task order amount is 2,000,000 Japanese YEN.  The maximum task order amount is 400,000,000 Japanese YEN.  Task orders issued under these contracts will be D-B-B or D-B in nature.  For D-B-B task orders, the Government will provide the contractor with full design.  For D-B task orders, contractor may be required to produce engineering designs ranging from shop-drawings to full designs in accordance with Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS) depending on the complexity of the task order.  The Government will provide the contractor with a project scope varying from a general scope of work with no drawings to a complete statement of work with design up to 90 percent.  Contractor designs will be conducted after award of a task order in accordance with both U.S. and Japanese design standards.  The contractor will be required to provide licensed professional designers having qualifications that meet contract requirements.

<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Email christopher.glista@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Tactical Technology Office (TTO), intends to award a sole source contract to the Open Source Robotics Foundation, Inc., of Menlo Park, California.  For the contract, the Open Source Robotics Foundation will develop an open-source robot simulation software system for use by the DARPA Robotics Challenge program.  The effort will develop validated models of robots (kinematics, dynamics, and sensors) and field environments (three-dimensional surfaces, solids, and material properties).  The effort will develop physics-based models of inertia, actuation, contact, and environment dynamics to simulate the robot's motion. The effort will make the simulation software available on an open-source basis, and will host the simulation so that participants in the DARPA Robotics Challenge program can access it freely. <br /><br />To search for innovative approaches to provide this service, DARPA performed an informal market survey.  Of the few existing candidate open-source robot simulators, the Open Source Robotics Foundation was deemed to be the sole viable supplier for providing the necessary open-source simulation software within the specified timeframe.  The Open Source Robotics Foundation simulator, called Gazebo, simulates many robots and sensors, supports the ROS and Player robot control middleware, and maintains tutorials, documentation and an active user base. The technology underlying Gazebo supports many use cases including remote operation through a client-server architecture, customization via a flexible plugin interface, accurate physics simulation, and rapid setup through intuitive graphical and programmatic interfaces.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  As the open-source robot simulation leader, the Open Source Robotics Foundation possesses unique knowledge and capabilities required to carry out the required research effort. No other source would be capable of satisfying the requirements for an affordable end-to-end solution necessary to meet the Government's needs. <br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Responses received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by submitting a white paper and past performance data by no later than 28 May 2012 to The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Attn: Mr. Christopher Glista, Contracts Management Office (CMO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 or via email to christopher.glista@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Tactical Technology Office (TTO), intends to award a sole source contract to Boston Dynamics Inc. (BDI), of Waltham, Mass.  For the contract, BDI will develop and build a set of humanoid robot systems for use by performers in both phases of the DARPA Robotics Challenge program.  This effort will develop approximately 8 identical platforms consisting of two legs, torso, on board computing, two arms with hands, and a sensor head. BDI will deliver these robots to DARPA so they can be provided to the top software development teams based on the results of the Virtual Disaster Challenge. Boston Dynamics will also provide in the field support and as required maintenance to the delivered systems.  <br /><br />The U.S. Army under its Protection Ensemble Test Mannequin (PETMAN) program developed, with Boston Dynamics, a humanoid robot with advanced range of motion and strength. This effort was then the basis of work done by BDI under the DARPA DSO M3 program on a platform named Atlas to increase its mobility. These two efforts have combined to develop a one of a kind humanoid robot with state of the art capability. DARPA has been a lead researcher in ground robotics over the last few decades. In addition it has tracked developments in this area outside the agency. Of the few existing humanoid robots, BDI was deemed to be the sole viable supplier for providing the necessary robotic platform capability within the specified timeframe. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCES MODIFICATION.<br />The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Contracts and Procurement Division (CPD) intends to issue a modification to contract DE-AC52-09NA28609 on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c)(1), to WesDyne International LLC, I-70 Exit 74 Gate D, Madison, PA 15663 to continue commercial down-blending services for an additional 5 metric tons (MT) of highly enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU), and to store the LEU for a LEU Inventory Reserve. The NNSA's Office of Fissile Materials Disposition (OFMD) and Y-12 Site Office will oversee the down-blending and storage of the material. DOE is evaluating its inventory of excess HEU, and decisions relating to the timely and availability of HEU have not been made to release a sufficient amount of HEU to warrant a new acquisition at this time, and further delay would likely result in disruption or shutdown of the only remaining U.S. HEU down-blending process. This material will provide additional LEU that will allow the OFMD to meet non-proliferation objectives and will be added to a larger domestic inventory of LEU that has been set-aside to support the surplus plutonium disposition program (MOX Backup LEU Inventory. Under the existing contract, WesDyne International LLC has subcontracted with the B&amp;W Nuclear Fuel Services facility in Erwin, Tennessee, and with this partnership is the only company capable of down-blending and storing the additional HEU material to satisfy the NNSA requirements to increase the MOA Backup LEU Inventory and maintain the industrial base. The applicable NAICS code is 325188 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a modification under the current contract and is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is forthcoming. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capabilities to fulfill this requirement no later than April 27, 2012, 4:00 pm MST. NNSA will not be responsible for any costs incurred in response to this notice. This notice in no way obligates the Government to award any modification to the existing contact.

<ARCHDATE>07112012
<CONTACT>MILTON L WASHINGTON, 407 381-8854

<a href="mailto:milton.washington@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training & Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is contemplating a new small business, single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract for the Army Low Overhead Training Toolkit (ALOTT) to support 'home station' training. The period of performance is anticipated to be one year plus four, one year options. The bulk of this planned contract will be for software development efforts which will Include Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS). This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback on capabilities currently available to meet the attached ALOTT requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 541511.  <br><br>Intent of this RFI: It is the intent of this RFI to accomplish two things: <br><br>1) Request capability statements/information from potential offerors to be utilized by PEO STRI as support in our continuous market research toward supporting upcoming ALOTT requirements. Capability statements will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research only. <br>2) Potentially invite offerors that respond with capability statements by the due date as specified in this RFI in for one-on-one sessions to assist us in determining the proper acquisition strategy, type of contract and to achieve our overall objectives under the ALOTT program.  One-on-one sessions may also include access to early proof of concept software. <br><br>PROGRAM BACKROUND: <br><br>As documented in the subparagraph 6.b.(14) of the Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability JLCCTC Capabilities Production Document approved in August 2006, The United States Army requires a low overhead Mission Command training simulation capability to bridge the training simulations gap between large scale JLCCTC supported exercises and non-simulation supported unit training cycles.  The User community increasingly demands training aids and tools that are easy and 'cheap' to prepare, use, and recover.  Large complex simulation architectures as currently provided by the JLCCTC are too resource-intensive and inflexible.  Especially for the enabling training in basic and lower-intermediate levels of Mission Command tasks as practiced under the crawl-walk-run training approach, for collective training at echelons below brigade or at any echelon when the Training Audience is relatively small or focused on a limited range of training tasks, and for institutional training and education. <br><br>Implementation of the Army's planned Regional Simulation Center concept requires that a low cost/low overhead solution to be fielded, with Users properly trained in its use, prior to the scheduled consolidation, to provide MCTCs, units, and schools/Centers of Excellence the capability to support locally-executed collective Mission Command training and education. <br><br>The ALOTT program was originally conceived as the Low Overhead Simulation/Stimulation Capability (LOSSC) and use cases were developed to communicate the functional capabilities and training objectives required to support low-overhead training.  Reference the LOSSC Use Case attachments for more information about the original objectives and requirements.  These use cases provided the basis for development of the program's technical requirements, which are defined in the separate documents attached. These use cases and requirements, for example, define objective low overhead metrics and Mission Command systems with which the ALOTT applications must interface.<br><br>The Initial proof of concept software technology developed early to support the attached Use Cases may be obtained during the one-on-one discussions (a power point describing the design of the product is attached).<br><br>DISCUSSION:<br><br>PEO STRI is contemplating the award of a small business, single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract for the Army Low Overhead Training Toolkit (ALOTT) to support the Warfighter.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to&nbsp;obtain knowledge and information for project&nbsp;planning purposes.<br /><br />The Office of Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS OIG) has a requirement for subscription data on corporate ownership and economic activity. The anticipated period of performance has not been determined. <br /><br />As a precursor to the competitive process to acquire these services, OIG is conducting market research to identify potentially qualified business sources that can provide information on the availability and cost of commercially-available subscription data on corporate ownership and economic activity. Primary use of this data would be to develop and strengthen algorithms for detecting potential fraud, waste, and abuse in HHS programs. The data provider would also provide comprehensive data documentation and related support services to HHS OIG. <br /><br />Please see the attached document for additional information and specifics of this RFI.

Project:  436-13-102, Replace Windows Building 141 

Scope of Work

The VA Montana Healthcare System requires the services of a qualified Architect / Engineer (A/E) firm to supply a design facilitating the replacement of all windows in Building 141 at the Fort Harrison campus.  The design intent of the project is to replace or remove these windows to correct a building condition deficiency and increase occupant comfort by maximizing daylight harvesting while minimizing solar heat gain and required maintenance.  Replacement windows are to be double hung style that are lockable with interior blinds.  The replacement windows shall utilize aesthetic styling appropriate to the period of the building.  
A/E Requirements
The anticipated construction cost associated with this design is expected to range between $800,000 and $1,000,000. The VA expectation is that the A/E will provide sufficient design services to utilize this entire construction budget.  The A/E must conduct adequate site investigation, provide all necessary deliverables, site visits, construction document reproduction, and construction period services as described below within the constraints of the schedule provided during design.
	Site Investigation
The A/E is responsible to conduct appropriate site investigation to obtain all information necessary to complete design activities.  The VA will provide reference documents to the extent possible but does not guarantee the accuracy of such documents.  Responsibility to verify all necessary information to complete design services belongs to the A/E.
	Deliverables 
The A/E will provide itemized construction cost estimates beginning with the 30% submission and continuing through the construction documents from which the VA may choose to modify scope to reflect the anticipated construction budget, limiting design activities only to those items that can be provided within the cost limitations.  This cost estimate shall be carried forward and modified to reflect changes on each subsequent submission.  Design of the previously described systems must meet all applicable codes, regulations, and standards.  This includes but is not limited to NFPA Codes, NEC, EPA, DEQ Regulations, OSHA 1926, and TJC Standards.  Additionally, the A/E is required to meet all applicable laws and regulation not explicitly stated in this document.  Design efforts and products shall be conducted and produced in compliance with VA Publications including Master Construction Specifications, Design Guides, and CAD Standards (http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL).  Compliance with public law regarding energy utilization is required, therefore selected products must be modeled and have properties that meet or exceed the performance standard specified in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 by 30% as required by EISA 2007.    
A/E submissions are to comply with the requirements stated in PG-18-15 Volume C.  The design submissions shall consist of progressively more complete documents consisting of the following:
Schematic Design (30%)
This submission shall include a minimum of two alternates of window planning which designate which windows would be retained and which would be eliminated, both alternatives indicating the total fenestration area.  Additionally a minimum of three window product selections shall be provided, all meeting the minimum functional, aesthetic, and energy intents as previously identified.  Each option should have a corresponding cost estimate.  Submitted drawings are to provide floor plan and elevation views.  Specifications are not required with this submittal.  The VA will request modifications as appropriate and select a single window plan and no more than two window products on which the A/E will complete energy modeling as part of the 50% submittal.  The submittal shall be provided as three full format hard copies and are to be mailed.  Additional documents such as construction cost estimates and window specifications are to be provided electronically.
Schematic Design (50%)
This submission shall include complete energy modeling of the VA selected alternates as well as corresponding cost estimates.  30% drawing are to be expanded to provide general window details for each configuration of opening.  Initial specifications derived from the VA master specification are to be provided with this submittal.  The specification will include a table of contents, a drawings index, and a full submittal log in addition to the applicable specification sections.  The VA will select a singular option to advance to Design Development at this point.  The submittal shall be provided as three full format hard copy drawings and one bound specification as well as an electronic word document. Three full format hard copies are to be mailed.  All documents are to be provided electronically at this point and can be emailed directly to the VA COTR or hosted on an independent site to be accessed by the VA COTR.  
Design Development (90%)
In addition to advancement to the 50% drawings and specifications, this deliverable shall contain an initial phasing plan.  Project phasing will require design efforts to create a temporary relocation space to accommodate construction.  All necessary details and specification sections are to be incorporated into this submittal.  The submittal shall be provided as three full format hard copy drawings and one bound specification as well as an electronic word document. Hard copies are to be mailed and electronic submittals are to be emails or hosted on an independent site to be accessed by the VA.  Supporting documentation is to be supplied electronically.
Construction Documents (100%)
This set should incorporate all VA revisions comments previously submitted.  It should also provide a coversheet with signature blocks for the appropriate approvals.  The submittal shall be provided electronically in PDF format in addition to three full format hard copies.  If further revisions are required, these corrections can be made and submitted via PDF as individual sheets prior to final approval.  After approval signatures are obtained, the VA will electronically return the signed coversheet for production. 
Final Construction Documents - Production
The signed coversheet and completed drawings and specifications are to be provided electronically as both read/write (.dwg or .doc) and read-only as .pdf file types.  Submissions are to utilize the most recent version of AutoCAD.  Production is to consist of four full-sized drawing sets, four half-sized drawing sets, and four bound specifications.  Supporting documentation is to be supplied electronically.    All submittals shall be marked as "Construction Documents".
Site Visits
Through the duration of design, the VA will require two site visits.  These site visits will be made at the request of the VA and will serve as an opportunity for the A/E to directly communicate with and receive input from VA end users. Such visits are intended to be design review meetings.  Any site visits not directly requested by the VA does not constitute a required site visit.  During Construction Period Services, the A/E will be required to attend an initial construction coordination meeting, a phase 1 inspection, and a final inspection, providing for a total of three VA required construction period site visits.  Meetings to review submissions may be conducted via teleconference, but will not require a site visit.
Construction Period Services
In addition to the previously addressed site visits during construction period services, the A/E shall act in an advisory and consultant role.  All contractor submittals and shop drawings are to be routed through the A/E for approval prior to delivery to the VA Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR).  Requests for Information and Modifications requests may be forwarded to the A/E for technical review at the discretion of the VA COTR or the VA Contracting Officer.  Any necessary redesign efforts that are required as a result of unforeseen site conditions will be provided by the A/E at no additional cost to the VA.  Requested redesign efforts that constitute a change in project scope warrant additional fees and must be approved by the VA Contracting Officer prior to work being completed.  The A/E shall receive red-line drawings from the contractor after the final inspection from which to create a finished set of As-Built Drawings to provide to the VA in the most recent version of AutoCAD.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 1100737. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-56 dated April 2, 2012.</p>
<p>Funds are not presently available for this requirement. Award will be subject to if/when appropriated funds are available.<br /><br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 334510- Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees and is issued as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) requires a high frequency ultrasound system with post-warranty service/maintenance options inclusive of all parts, labor and travel for the entire system.</p>
<p>The High-Frequency Ultrasound System will be used to image anatomical and physiological features of small animals used as model systems for human disease and injury. The high frequency ultrasound system should enable the researcher to obtain in vivo anatomical, functional, physiological and molecular data simultaneously, in real-time and with resolution down to 30 &mu;m.</p>
<p>High frequency transducers <br />&bull; Transducers shall be included capable of frequencies ranging from 15 MHz to 55 MHz <br />&bull; Adjustable focus depths for each transducer.<br />&bull; Each high frequency transducer should be able to deliver a usable frame rate of 300-400 frames per second</p>
<p>Integrated imaging station <br />&bull; Allows secure positioning of the animal (rats and mice) on a heated handling table, which maintains the animal's physiological body temperature and overall physiological function. <br />&bull; Integrated platform with an isoflurane-based anesthesia system that can be connected to oxygen or air.</p>
<p>Monitoring of physiological function and data <br />&bull; ECG, heart rate, temperature and respiration should be recorded and displayed on the monitor screen alongside the images. This information should be able to be exported and saved. <br />&bull; ECG and Respiration gating can be controlled by the user.</p>
<p>M-Mode <br />&bull; M-Mode imaging should produce quantifiable images to characterize moving anatomy, such as a cardiac wall motion by selecting a line of the B-Mode image and observing it over time. <br />&bull; Should be able to sample volume size down to 50 microns <br />&bull; Should allow the user to steer the sample volume to any angle the user chooses.<br /><br />Doppler Mode Capabilities<br />&bull; The equipment should be capable of using Color Doppler Imaging to produce an image of directional flow in blood vessels. The system should overlay colors on the image of the blood vessels to represent the speed and direction of blood flow through the vessels. <br />&bull; In Pulsed-wave Doppler (PW) Mode, the transducer should be able to detect motion and then show the readings on screen in a spectral display. <br />&bull; The sampling rate for PW Doppler should range from 1-2 kHz to 125 kHz; and be able to detect velocities from a few mm/s to approximately 6 m/s. <br />&bull; The sweep speed parameter should be selectable within a range from 0.25 seconds at 4000 Hz to 5.1 seconds at 200 Hz.<br />&bull; 3D Power Doppler Mode will collect Power Doppler data during a 3D-Mode acquisition and be able to reconstruct a 3D volume that is integrated with the surrounding B-Mode 3D volume.</p>
<p>3D Imaging <br />&bull; 3D-Mode imaging should provide tools to create and manipulate three-dimensional renderings and make volumetric measurements of objects viewed with high-resolution ultrasound. <br />&bull; Acquires a series of 2-dimensional "slices" (as small as 10 &mu;m) and assembles them into a 3D data set that can then be visualized and manipulated. Targets (for example, tumor growth) can be segmented and volumetric measurements made. <br />&bull; 3D imaging can be used in B-Mode, Power Doppler Mode or Contrast mode imaging procedures. <br />3D acquisition functionality allows for precise control of step size, range and slice thickness. This functionality can be integrated with ECG and respiration gating to suppress heart and respiratory errors. <br />&bull; Range = # of slices x step size. <br />&bull; Maximum number of 500 slices.</p>
<p>Contrast Imaging <br />&bull; A suite of software analysis and quantification tools should be provided that enables perfusion imaging and targeted/molecular imaging research applications. <br />&bull; Software tools should allow quantification of relative blood volume, blood perfusion and vascular density. <br />&bull; Should be capable of molecular imaging studies: visualization and quantification of endothelial cell markers involved in angiogenesis and inflammation in vivo, in real-time. <br />&bull; Should be capable of detecting contrast agents such as microbubbles.</p>
<p>Post-processing tool for perfusion and targeted signal analysis <br />&bull; Perfusion parameters are derived from a curve fitting algorithm for both bolus kinetics and replenishment kinetics following destruction reperfusion <br />&bull; Perfusion parameters include a series of calculations for amplitude, time and combination of amplitude and time <br />&bull; Spatial rendering is available in the form of parametric maps <br />&bull; Data can be exported in TIFF, BMP, video files and CSV formats</p>
<p>Portability of system <br />&bull; The system should be portable from one room or lab to another.</p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administrations' (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), jointly with other World Health Organization collaboration centers, is involved in registration and quality control of influenza vaccines and performs serological studies to obtain evidence as to whether the current vaccines induce satisfactory antibody levels to the new epidemic strains. Human serum panels from vaccine recipients in the different countries are analyzed for the presence of antibodies to the HA antigens of representative circulating strains. The serology information obtained from the studies provides important information to support selection of representative circulating strains for vaccine production.</p>
<p>The antibody titers need to be tested by neutralization assay using live viruses. The neutralization test is performed in two stages: (1) a virus-antibody reaction step, in which the virus is mixed with dilutions of serum and time allowed for antibodies to react, and (2) an inoculation step, in which the mixture is inoculated into the appropriate host system (e.g. cell cultures, embryonated eggs, or animals).</p>

<DESC>The Institute's Transition Center offers the High Stress Assignment Outbrief program, which occurs in either scheduled large group sessions (MQ950) or ad hoc individual and small group settings (MQ951). The Outbriefs are designed to be two-way educational programs, combining a psycho-educational component and a structured protocol interview. The facilitator-led psycho-educational section covers the basics of decompression symptomatology, related pathologies, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, resources available to employees and family members, and suggestions for facilitating personal transitions in resuming civilian life, re-entering a more normative work environment, and reintegrating into personal relationships after service in a threatening and demanding overseas assignment. The interview follows a series of questions designed to elicit and collect information on the ever-changing circumstances and experiences of officers deployed to high stress posts.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING PROCURED UTILIZING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.<br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51.
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being procured using full and open competition.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Fire Research Division, requires a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer for a Netzsche Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA). The development of computer models aimed at predicting fire growth and spread, fire toxicity, and material flammability characteristics requires experimental data (in the condensed and solid phase) in order for these models to accurately predict these behaviors. Increased emphasis on the environmental, health, and safety of products (e.g., potential banning of gas phase fire retardants) is restricting the number of materials available for complying with fire safety requirements; however, the fundamental material property information (condensed and gas phase) necessary to determine suitable EHS compliant alternatives is lacking.</p>
<p>A Netszch STA F1 Juptier TGA was installed to accelerate the evaluation of new technologies aimed at reducing the flammability of materials. However, this instrument in its current configuration only helps understand the condensed phase behavior. To understand the entire picture gas phase analysis is required, which can only be accomplished with an FTIR attached to this TGA.</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) each, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer for a Netzsche Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) that must meet or exceed the following minimum specifications. All items must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award:</p>
<p>1. Hardware<br />&#61607; FTIR must connect and operate directly with the existing Netzsch STA F1 Jupiter.<br />&#61607; FTIR must be able to be operated independently of the Netzsch STA F1 Juptier.<br />&#61607; Vendor will supply all parts and labor needed for linking the FTIR to the Netszche.<br />&#61607; High resolution scanner (minimum of 0.4 cm-1)<br />&#61607; Capable of fast data collection (collecting at least 20 spectra/s with a minimum resolution of 17 cm-1)<br />&#61607; The connection between the FTIR and Netzsche must be heated and sealed to ensure no loss on gas products transferred between the instruments.<br />&#61607; Accessories needed for delivering energies (e.g., dry air) to the instrument from labs existing facilities.<br />&#61607; Diagnostic units install to help diagnose spectrometer components (e.g., status of lamp)<br />&#61607; Controllable transfer gas flow rate.<br />&#61607; Signal to noise resolution of at least 5.25*10-5 for 5 second spectra collection and 9.25*10-6 for 1 minute spectra collection.<br />&#61607; System size not to exceed 68 in (width) and 45 in (depth) due to space limitation.<br />&#61607; Accessories for ATR and analyzing liquids.</p>
<p>2. Software<br />&#61607; Software will allow for 2D and 3D data processing. <br />&#61607; Data processing, using vendor's software, can be performed during data collection for real time analysis or processing of previously taken data. <br />&#61607; The test results and analysis shall be stored and displayed in real time.<br />&#61607; The operator shall have the ability to export the raw data to a spreadsheet with the same information.<br />&#61607; Software is capable of routine FTIR analysis (e.g. Normalization, calculate derivative and average spectra, spectra subtraction, spectrum calculator, curve fit, peak Pick, spectra interpretation tool)<br />&#61607; FTIR software shall able to start and stay synchronized with the Netzsch TGA data and gases</p>
<p>3. Other<br />&#61607; Vendor shall provide owner's manual and list of replacement parts (with model numbers).<br />&#61607; Vendor shall provide a FTIR Library with at least 4500 spectra for polymers, merck, basf, gases, etc.</p>
<p>4. Warranty<br />The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, a one year warranty period for the system. Warranty work shall be completed on-site at NIST or at the Contractor's site, at the discretion of the Contractor. All costs and responsibilities associated with parts, labor, travel and shipping shall be covered under the warranty. The warranty shall commence upon final acceptance by the Government.</p>
<p>Line Item 0002: Installation: <br />The Contractor shall provide installation and testing for the system and software. Installation shall be completed on-site at NIST Gaithersburg and shall include, at a minimum, uncrating/un-packaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of the system, turn-key start up including all testing of the system and software, and demonstration of all performance specifications. <br /><br />Line Item 0003: Training:<br />The Contractor shall schedule and facilitate one (1) training session for NIST personnel on-site at NIST in Gaithersburg, MD. The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, and basic troubleshooting, including operation of the FTIR and analyze FTIR data for operating the FTIR in the independent and Netzsch linked experiments. The training may be completed at NIST immediately after installation and demonstration of performance specifications, however, not later than 30 days after successful completion of installation and demonstration of performance specifications.</p>
<p>Installation and training shall be scheduled in advance with the NIST Technical Contact to be identified at the time of award.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor shall provide a copy of the protest to both the Contracting Officer and the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131)<br />US COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS<br />2100 2ND SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two years, with three one-year options</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Manager is a member of one of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Asia, Africa (AFR), Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak), Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), and Middle East (ME). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the administration and management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to hire qualified personnel needed to assist and support OTI's regional teams with program implementation-related activities.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the Program Manager is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Program Manager is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Program Manager is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Program Manager has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee (e.g. the Sr. Program Manager), the Program Manager will:</p>
<p>At the GS-11 equivalent level:</p>
<p>&bull; Perform complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries;</p>
<p>&bull; Implement and manage assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts in overseas conflict or post-conflict areas for up to one month or more if required;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide backstopping and troubleshooting support to field-based staff through frequent communication;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI Program Assistants/Program Managers as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure completion of OTI project administration, budgeting and contracting action needs;</p>

<p>&bull; Manage and/or participate in the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and personal services contractors;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as COR (Contracting Officer Representative) for Task Orders with a contractor for Program Office services, ensuring OTI's requirements are met (serving as COR requires the successful completion of a USAID training course within the first 6-12 months of employment);</p>
<p>&bull; In limited circumstances, the incumbent may be required to provide assistance to organizations outside of OTI but within the current scope of work, where such assistance would enhance both OTI's goals and objectives as well as the incumbent's job skills;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative, personnel and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull; Respond to requests for information and taskers regarding OTI programs from within and outside the Agency in collaboration with OTI's Program Office;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTI's program goals;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions, the Department of State, other USG agencies and departments, NGOs, international donors, and others interested in particular OTI country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Initiate and manage the preparation of documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop, monitor, evaluate and recommend performance measures for country programs and individual projects, including the work of contractors and grantees;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting team leader or country or deputy country representative in his/her absence, for example.</p>
<p>At the GS-12 equivalent level:</p>
<p>&bull; Perform the same duties as the GS-11 equivalent level but with less supervision, greater decision-making authority, and greater independence of action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Program Manager will take direction from and will report to their respective OTI Regional Team Leader within the Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>

<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>The Government of the United States of America requires Health Insurance coverage for its employees as further described in C.1.2 in Colombia. The Government has determined that the prevailing practice by employers in Colombia is to provide for their employees health insurance protection and that the cost of such insurance protection is usually borne by both the employee and the employer on a 20% cost to employee and 80% cost to the employer basis plus an additional co-pay of ColPs$ 24,200 for both employee and dependents per event. Health insurance protection will be representative of locally prevailing compensation practice as further described in C.1.2. The specific health benefit coverage under this contract is set forth in Section C and the Exhibits in Section J.</p>

<p>Mfr: Ultimate Training Munitions</p>
<p>Justification: for Sole Source: The similated munnitions used in our training weapons are designed to be used in concert with the UTM bolt and magazine systems. The use of equipmtent from other manufactors could result inoparability, bodily injury or death if not properly fitted to our current weapons systems.UTMs are one of the first technologies specifically designed for force-on-force training. The munitions provide realistic cyclic rates in semi-automatic and automatic weapons which match that of "live fire" The muzzle velocity is an average of less than 3ft/lbs incurring minimal noise and emissions. UTMs do not have to be handled as hazardous waste. UTM Therefore the proposed equiment must match the equipment currently being used at Robins AFB.</p>
<p>Price(s) should be FOB Destination (Robins AFB GA 31098). In addition to price and delivery, quote should include your cage code, DUNS number, and taxpayer ID number. Requested delivery date is 30 days ARO or earlier.</p>

<DESC>This is to provide clarifications to previous posting.<br><br>The requirement for the MI-FI Air Cards will now read "Up to 15 MI-FI Air Card Internet Access."<br><br>The following are questions and answers that were submitted for clarification:<br><br>Question #1 :  Are the quantity requested existing lines and will the Government require porting of these numbers to a new carrier if the incumbent carrier is not chosen?<br>Answer # 1:  The quantities requested are for expansion capabilities.  The actual number of devices in use are 52 ea Cell phones and 110 Blackberry devices.  If at all possible, we would like to have the numbers ported in the event the<br>incumbent carrier isn't chosen.<br><br>Question #2:- The Government refers to a map to demonstrate critical and non-critical areas. Does the Government intend on providing offerers with maps to demonstrate these areas or is the Government referring to the vendors' maps?<br>Answer # 2:  The map was attached to the last updated posting.<br><br>Question #3:  The Government requests international coverage for 15 BlackBerries, but does not provide the number of minutes required annually for vendors to quote and the government to properly fund for these services.  Will the government be providing an estimate for budgetary purposes to all carriers, so this can be included for your funding documents?<br>Answer #3:  We have 8 actual devices that have international packages on them.  It will be hard to estimate the yearly international minutes due to the fact that<br>they all travel at different times and for various lengths each time. Please submit a price list for roaming rates to various countries or a price list that would accomodate these requirements. <br>

A PO will be issued, with a level of funding, to enable quick orders to be placed, rcvd, accepted, an invc submitted, and pymnt rendered against the funding doc. 3) All companies shall indicate TAA-compliance. As this is a law that the gvnmnt can only purchase U.S.-made or designated country end products, companies are considered TAA-compliant if they follow TAA guidelines. That said, contractors shall indicate TAA-compliancy in their response in order to be considered under this solicitation.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>27. For the training courses listed in the Solicitation that run from 1.0 to 4.0 hours, does the NIH plan on issuing task orders for a combination of classes that when combined, represent a normal 8-hour work day, or must the contractor price out individual courses on a stand alone basis, ie. assuming that on any given day only a single under 8-hr. class will be delivered?</p>
<p>- The NIH intends to award task orders on a quarterly basis. In it, those 1 to 4 hour classes may be included; however may or may not be performed on the same day. Courses to be held will in that task order will be coordinated with the contractor well in advance to the course being performed. The couses are to be priced out individually on a stand alone basis.</p>
<p>28. In regards to the solicitation, can you please tell me if the following CLIN Items require certifications or just the required numbers of hours in training:</p>
<p><span><span>CLIN 0002 - Bucket Op Training<br />CLIN 0014 - Hoist &amp; Crane Rigger Training<br />CLIN 0015 - Hoist &amp; Crane Inspection Training<br />CLIN 0016 - KubotaTunnel Cart Training</span></span></p>
<p>- Only training with OSHA requirements require certification. The other training requires the number of hours of training as indicated in this solicitation<br /><br />29. The RFP states four copies to be submitted but does not specify if they can be submitted electronically. Can they be submitted electronically?</p>
<p>- Because the RFP did not specify this previously, electronic copies will be accepted. They must be in either Microsoft Word or PDF format only. If you are submitting hard copies, please submit to the address listed in the PDF copy of the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />30. Must we submit the multiple referenced certifications or may we submit a letter confirming that we will comply with all of the selected ones?</p>
<p>- Proof/verification of the multiple referenced certifications needs to be included in the proposal submission. Copies would be nice, but a letter confirming compliance will be acceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;31. Can you please clarify the answer to question #30 "Proof/verification of the multiple referenced certifications needs to be included in the proposal submission. Copies would be nice, but a letter confirming compliance will be acceptable'. Is this referring to the instructor's certification credentials or page 30 of the RFQ Offeror Representations and Certifications provision?</p>
<p>- This is referring to the instructors' certification credentials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>b. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>Representations and Certifications:<br /><br />All offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (Feb 2012).

Past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 15.3.(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Proposals submitted in response to this request for proposal will be evaluated based upon the following non-price or non-cost factors, which are of equal importance:
Factor (A) Past Performance: sellers shall submit not less than two references for services performed during the past three years.  Each reference shall include: the company or agency name, address, contract or order number, point(s) of contract phone number and email address(es). References provided may be contacted by the Government.  Their statements will be used in the evaluation of the offeror=BFs proposal.  In addition, any information obtained by the Government from references outside of the offeror=BFs proposal may also be used, in a similar manner, in the technical evaluation of the offeror=BFs proposal to the extent appropriate. Past performance information provided by references, from Government records, or from other than the sources identified by the offeror may be used in the evaluation under any or all applicable evaluation factors.  In addition to the foregoing, PIPRS.gov will be used as a source of past performance information in the source selection process, in addition to any other past performance information required under this solicitation.  All past performance information will be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision.Factor (B) Quality Control Program:  Proposals must include the offeror=BFs proposed Quality Control Program for evaluation.  See the Statement of Work for the Quality Control Program requirements for this award.Factor (C) Operation Management Plan.  Proposals must include the offeror=BFs proposed Operation Management Plan for evaluation.  See the Statement of Work for the Operation Management Plan requirements for this award.(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
Award shall be made to the vendor whose proposal, conforming to this RFP, is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and the other non-cost or non-price factors listed above.  In determining which proposal offers the greatest value or advantage to the Government, overall technical merit will be considered less important than price or cost.  The degree of importance of price or cost as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality in the technical merits of the proposals.  Between acceptable proposals with a significant difference in technical merit, a determination will be made as to whether the additional technical merit or benefits reflected by a higher priced proposal warrants payment of the additional price or cost.Offerors must have completed ORCA registration and comply with the provision at 52.212-3.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Can you please send me the "Stock List Price" for P/N 3289522-3-1? I couldn't find it in the solicitation.</p>
<p>A. We are unable to release the stock list price at this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><br />Q. Many of [the 100% replacement parts listed in the Appendix A] show no availability or low quantities and we will either need to have those parts manufactured with the drawings or if Tinker can supply us with GFM.</p>
<p>A. We were able to find all but one item from the 100% Replacement parts list in stock, with sufficient quantities&nbsp;on DoD EMALL. NSN 5331-00-853-0246 was the only item we found with no stock. However, we were able to find it in Haystack.</p>
<p><br /><br />Q. Do you have the rights to the drawings for 3171197-2?</p>
<p>A. There is an unlimited rights "source control drawing" in JEDMICS for 3171197. It does not provide sufficient info for someone to make the parts, it just defines how large the sensor can be, and what temperature the sensor<br />should open, etc.</p>

<CONTACT>Michael Mcguire
<DESC>The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD), is issuing this solicitation, Number D12PS00214 as a Request for Proposals (RFP) on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS). AQD anticipates awarding a single Firm Fixed Price contract to Renovate the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station. The contract will be awarded for a base period of 120 days.  This is an acquisition for commercial products and services and will be conducted using the guidance in FAR 12, FAR 15 and FAR 36. The applicable NAICS code is 237110, "Water and Sewer Line and related Structure Construction". The small business size standard is $33.5 million. This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to large and small business concerns.
PURPOSE OF the contractSCOPE OF WORK: As part of its capacity building efforts in Iraq, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is working with the Government of Iraq (GOI) to renovate the Iraqi Ministry of Agricultures (IMOA) Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station, located in Wasit province.   This USDA project is being managed by USDAs Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and is part of an overall United States Government effort to build capacity in various areas within the Government of Iraq.  USDA is working to build the capacity of the GOI in agricultural research and extension, as well as other agriculture-related subject areas. In a general Letter of Agreement between the USDA and the Iraq Ministry of Agriculture signed March 3, 2011, USDA and the IMOA agreed to collaborate on the renovation of the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station.  The Al Sewaira Research Station is located in Wasit province approximately 60 km (35 miles) southeast of Baghdad and covers approximately 150 hectares (375 acres or 625 donums) of fertile land.  It is located approximately 2,150 meters from the Al-Dohan canal, which is its primary source of water for irrigation.  Irrigation water is currently supplied from the canal via an open trench from the Al-Dohan Canal.  The Al Sewaira Research Station was established to conduct research on water management techniques and other aspects of agricultural production.  Its experimental fields are also used for extension purposes.

<DESC>MODIFICATION TO EXTEND THE POSTING DATE TO APRIL 19TH, 2012<br />AND ON APRIL 12TH&nbsp;ADD TO&nbsp;POSTING VERBAGE&nbsp;BELOW.<br />&nbsp;<br />***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Sontek/YSI Incorporated, of Olympia., WA for two 250KHz acoustic Doppler profilers and accessories.<br /><br />***The sole source determination is based on the Center for Operational Products and Services (CO-OPS) needs to collect, analyze and distribute historical and real-time observations and predictions of water levels, coastal currents, and other metrological and oceanographic data. This purchase is for stationary mounted side looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) which provides information about currents critical for marine transportation within Humboldt Bay. They are being put in the area to improve the safety of marine transportation. Other products lack the particular features, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs. This equipment is already in use in the field by CO-OPs personnel and contractors with training to calibrate and repair the systems. SonTek/YSI is the sole manufacturer and only authorized supplier of this instrumentation. To introduce another system would require training of field personnel and contractors plus the added expense of purchasing additional parts to repair the systems at a cost to the Government. Therefore it is in the best interest of the Government to purchase the current equipment in use.<br />Other specifications for this project are specifically.<br />&bull; Unit must be 250 KHz with compass, tilt, temperature and 30 meter pressure sensor<br />&bull; Unit must have two transducer heads<br />&bull; Unit must have a max range of at least 180m<br />&bull; Unit should have an RS232/422 switchable data output with a baud rate of 1200 to 19200<br />&bull; Unit must have no internal battery<br />&bull; Unit must have a 7.5 inch diameter base<br />&bull; Unit must be 9.35 inches from bottom to the underside of the transducer head<br />&bull; Unit must be fully tested and approved for CO-OPS use
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the needed services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 4 days after publication of this posting. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

CONFORMED SYNOPSIS (SUMMARY)

ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO SEPARATE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast (NAVFAC SE), Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville, Florida intends to award up to four (4) Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for Professional Architectural and Engineering (A/E) design services. The contract will primarily provide design services for Department of Defense (DoD) and Non-DoD facilities located in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Guantanamo Bay Cuba, and Andros Island Bahamas.

Although less frequently, this contract could be used for design services at activities located within the entire NAVFAC AOR (worldwide).
 Design services will primarily be for preparation of Design Bid Build documents (100% plans and specifications) and Design Build Requests for Proposal (RFPs). Projects will include new facilities and renovation/modernization/repair of existing facilities. Project types will include general building construction (administrative and training facilities, dormitories, hangars, child development centers, fitness centers, etc.), airfield projects and waterfront projects. Other ancillary activities associated with providing the above services will include, but not be limited to, topographic surveys, geotechnical investigations, lead and asbestos surveys, hurricane damage facility condition assessments, cost estimates, and DD 1391 Military Construction Data documentation.

The duration of the contract will be for one (1) year from the date of initial contract award, with up to four (4) additional one-year option periods.
 The total amount that may be paid under each contract, including option years, will not exceed $30,000,000. The Government guarantees a minimum of $10,000 for the contract term of each contract awarded from this synopsis. The minimum guarantee is typically met by the issuance of the first task order. The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. In the event the estimated annual fee is not met, the Government reserves the right to carry-over any unused capacity to the following option year(s).

The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the A&E performance under the subject contract.
 The proposed contracts are being solicited as UNRESTRICTED, FULL AND OPEN to all large and small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) for this contract is 541330. The prime firm and consultants for each contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term (including option years, if implemented). The anticipated value of construction projects for this procurement will typically be less than $30,000,000 although larger projects may be included.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

Offerors will be required to provide a product sample as part of the proposal. The sample vehicle is not required to be fully production representative, however it must demonstrate that it is a mature design and with minor engineering effort, capable of meeting the production requirement. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement&nbsp;is 336112,&nbsp;with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.

8.  Market Research:  Market research was conducted by searching the VetBiz.gov database on February 16, 2012 to determine if Ray Group International is a SDVOSB.  This search concluded that Ray Group International is registered and certified and qualifies as a SDVOSB in accordance with the federal small business size standard for the applicable North American Industry Classification System Code 541511 Custom Computer Programming or Software Development.  It was verified on February 16, 2012 that Ray Group International is registered in the Central Contractor Registration database and is eligible to receive a Government contract.  The technical experts from the Office of Mental Health Services Suicide Prevention have determined that Ray Group International is technically capable of meeting the Government's requirements for this effort based on the fact that they have performed similar technical services for the VA in the past and they have proven the posess the necessary skills and capabilities to successfully perform the tasks under this requirement.

9.  Other Facts:  The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that this proposed action meets all the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 8127(c).  This acquisition is below the $5,000,000.00 threshold, Ray Group International is a responsible SDVOSB for performance of the services herein, and the proposed contract can be awarded at a fair and reasonable price.

<DONBR>NA
<DESC>Consistent with FAR Subpart 8.405-6(a)(1)(i), FSA's requirement for awarding the task order as only one source is because only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required. <br /><br />Consistent with the agency's existing collection agreements, this task order shall be a performance-based, firm-fixed price order in accordance with the terms and conditions of GSA Schedule GS-23F-0341N. The period of performance for this effort shall be from April 1, 2012 through September 30, 2012 with an estimated value of $1,000,000.00.<br /><br />In order to close CollectCorp' s contract FSA must be able to ensure that all invoices have been properly paid and that all accounts are recalled from the contractor. At this time, the Government is unable to confirm the accuracy of the debt collection system's ability to perform either of these tasks. In order to minimize the impact on the borrowers, it is FSA intention to authorize CollectCorp to keep working with the borrowers on their system until both of these functions have been validated as accurate. Consequently, the accounts cannot be properly transferred to another servicer until the debt collection system is able to perform the recall and invoice functions.
