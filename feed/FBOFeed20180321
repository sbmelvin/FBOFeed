This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer.
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 60 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. 
While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Research Unit 6 in Lima Peru is seeking to purchase primers and probes to be used for molecular diagnosis of Influenza and arboviral febrile viruses in the Virology &amp; Emerging Infections Department. Specifically, requirement involves detector primers (DNA targeting markers) for molecular techniques like PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) in real-time platforms and sanger DNA sequencing that are used for precise identification of human influenza viruses (Influenza A-matrix gene and B) and its subtypes (H3, H1pdm/SwH1N1, H1 seasonal and H5) (SOP N6-VIR-MB RV 014); sequencing full genome of influenza A using chain-terminator method of Sanger (SOP N6-VIR-MB RV 005) in order to obtain genetic maps for phylogenetic analysis of the virus in our region.
<p>All these NAMRU-6 assays have been validated using the TaqMan 7500/7500 Fast Real time PCR system and therefore, compatibility of the consumables is a requirement. The RT-PCR assays have been developed independently for each SOP and involve much time and effort by laboratory technicians, and supervisors for final approval.</p>
<p>Place of Delivery: NAMRU-6 - Lima Peru</p>
<p>If capable sources are not identified through this notice, then NAMRU 6 intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(i) to Biosearch Technologies, for the requirements of NAMRU-6.<br /><br />This pre-solicitation is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement.

<DESC><br />The Defense Security Service (DSS) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Oracle America, National Security Group (Oracle NSG) under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Other Than Full and Open Competition procedures, utilizing FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Subpart 13.5, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items, for the acquisition of subject matter experts (SME) required to inform the development, operations and maintenance of the Defense Insider Threat Management and Analysis Center (DITMAC) Multi-Domain Database Platform (MDDP).
<p>Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) authorizes the DoD to contract without full and open competition under certain circumstances. For this acquisition, other than full and open competition is permitted per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B).</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) states that "For DoD...services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A)	Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, <br />or <br />(B)	Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B))</p>
<p>Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) states "in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, or the continued provision of highly specialized services, such property or services may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in-</p>
<p>(i)	substantial duplication of cost to the United States which is not expected to be recovered through competition; <br />or <br />(ii)	unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs.</p>
<p>With regard to the substantial duplication of cost, the FAR does not define &lsquo;substantial.' However the widely accepted definition in Webster's dictionary is &lsquo;of considerable importance, size, or worth.' Thus far, the DITMAC has provided funding in Operations and Maintenance and Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation funding in order to bring this single stream DoD-wide MDDP to fruition equal to 24% of the total value of this follow-on effort. The Contracting Officer (CO) has determined that a quarter of the value of the contract is deemed of considerable size to warrant a sole-source follow-on, as that amount of funding would be duplicative in nature and not in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>In addition, the FAR does not define &lsquo;delay' or &lsquo;unacceptable.' However, the widely accepted definition of &lsquo;unacceptable' is not acceptable, not pleasing, or welcome and the definition of &lsquo;delay' is: a period of time by which something is late or postponed. If this requirement was to be fulfilled via competition, the DITMAC will have a stop work on version 3.x of the system that the entire DoD is anticipating. Each month of stoppage will result in a minimum of 1.5 months of delay in getting the system fielded (loss of expertise, forcing a ramp-down of development and a subsequent ramp-up). As a competitive requirement of this magnitude, the resultant delay would be equal to one year, one month, and two weeks. Potentially, disrupting the entire effort due to the loss of technological expertise in the interim and resulting in a disruption of critical technology that the DoD requires to mitigate the internal and external threats to the United States by not having the MDDP in place.</p>
<p>This requirements meets the stipulations in 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) set forth above.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals. No solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can meet the requirement are encouraged to identify themselves and provide a substantive statement with descriptive literature and any other supporting information to the CO within three business days of publication of this notice. All information received within three days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government to determine if the more than one firm can meet the Government's requirements and is capable of providing technically acceptable services. Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via e-mail only. A determination not to compete the described requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Any questions or comments should be directed via e-mail ONLY to Ms. Ren&eacute;e S. Stahl at renee.s.stahl.civ@mail.mil. Thank you for your interest.</p>

<SOLNBR>12034318Q0098
<CONTACT>Karen Ruklic, Phone 208-983-5144, Fax 208-983-4098, Email kruklic@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This contract requires planting 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 gallon shrubs as well as 3 &amp; 5 gallon conifers across approximately 13 acres of re-contoured, coarse-textured dredge mine spoils (some areas have limited soil) in Reach 2 of Newsome Creek. The substrate ranges from sand to large cobble that is approximately 12 inches in diameter. The area has been reshaped to provide upland, terrace, floodplain, and wetland surfaces. Coarse wood has been spread on site, some of which will need to be moved to facilitate access for planting, but will need to be replaced to provide floodplain roughness. It is anticipated that machine assisted planting using a small excavator or similar piece of equipment will be feasible in most areas, and hand power-auger planting will be feasible in areas not accessible to heavy equipment. Stockpiled residual soil (government supplied) is located on-site and shall be used to amend planting holes in highly cobbled areas. All work shall be performed in compliance with the solicitation terms, conditions, specifications, drawings and attachments. This includes furnishing all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals except those designated as Government furnished. Plants shall be furnished by the Government.
<p>This project is located on Newsome Creek in Idaho County, Idaho upstream of the Newsome Town Site, approximately 10 miles northwest of Elk City, Idaho.&nbsp; Access to the site is from Idaho State Highway 14 to Newsome Creek Road 1858 which passes through Newsome Townsite. Beyond Newsome Townsite, past MP 7 of Road 1858, a 0.9-mile long primitive access route to the right provides access to the project.&nbsp; The project site is curerntly snow-covered and accessible only by foot.&nbsp; A formal site visit is planned during the solicitation period.</p>
<p>Work may commence on August 15, 2018. An earlier start date is prohibited due to the potential negative effect on plant survivability. All instream work (including crossing the stream channel) must be performed between August 15, 2018 and September 30, 2018. All work must be completed by October 15, 2018.</p>
<p>The solicitation shall be issued in early May. The acquisition has been set-aside for small businesses.</p>

<DESC>Introduction
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is seeking information through this Request for Information (RFI) for the development of a Payload Separation System (PSS) and Payload Interface Adapter (PIA) for primary and co-manifested payloads on the Space Launch System (SLS). This RFI focuses on Payload Separation Systems of various sizes and capacities needed for Block 1B configurations to allow for deployment of the payload from the Payload Adapter (PLA), and is open to responses from all commercial entities. Responses to this RFI are intended to provide input for an examination into the technology development, design, qualification, and manufacture of separation systems that meet the needs of the SLS Program.</p>
<p>The key metrics of interest to NASA for these concepts are affordability (for Design, Development, Test, Evaluation, and Production), reliability, and performance (i.e., mass). Human rating of hardware will be required for systems flown with the Orion configuration. The intent is to understand capabilities, Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), environmental constraints, and operational characteristics of available PSS-type systems. NASA is interested in a first launch of the PSS with the SLS Program as early as 2022, with follow-on flights at a rate of approximately one per year.</p>
<p>Industry response to this RFI is requested within the context of the requirements and general approach described in the following sections.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The first launch vehicle being designed, developed, and built as part of the NASA SLS Program is designated as the Block 1 configuration. A follow-on vehicle with increased lift capability, designated as Block 1B, is also being developed. For this upgraded configuration, the vehicle core stage, core stage engines, and boosters remain unchanged, but the Block 1B vehicle will replace the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) with a more powerful upper stage called the Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) to deliver heavier payloads beyond low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>Block 1B includes two configurations that will require unique payload separation systems, as shown in Figures 1 and 2:<br />1. Orion spacecraft with a Co-Manifested Payload. A PLA is currently under development which will connect the EUS to a separable Universal Stage Adapter (USA) that provides a structural interface between the EUS and Orion. The PLA will enable the vehicle to carry a co-manifested payload with a required capability of 10 metric tons inside the USA, between the EUS and Orion.<br />2. Cargo-Only Primary Payload. This configuration will utilize a PLA with a required payload capability of 40 metric tons. A cargo fairing takes the place of Orion and the USA.</p>
<p>Multiple versions of the PLA with different upper diameters, mass constraints, and load capabilities may be required. As shown in Figure 3, the PLA is composed of a Payload Attach Fitting (PAF) and a <br />PSS. Payload Separation Systems of various sizes and capacities will be needed for both Block 1B configurations to allow for deployment of the payload from the PLA.</p>
<p>PSS Description</p>
<p>The PSS should be a mass-efficient separating interface between the PAF and the payload which accommodates Co-manifested and Primary Payloads. The PSS should be designed, developed, built, and certified for flight consistent with NASA design, construction, workmanship, and qualification standards and with other technical and programmatic requirements associated with human rating considerations, including configuration management, reliability analysis, and safety assessment processes. Existing systems with proven flight pedigree that have not been designed to NASA standards are suitable if rationale is provided demonstrating how they meet equivalent standards, or an assessment is furnished of what impacts would be required to become compliant. Affordability approaches to minimize the development cost to NASA and deliver cost-efficient production and operations are requested.</p>
<p>Requested Response Topics</p>
<p>The specific objective of this RFI is to solicit information that may potentially enhance NASA's planned approach for PSS procurement and assist in formulating the acquisition strategy. Responses are requested for the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Information on separation systems with payload interface diameters between 1500 and 4500 mm. Of specific interest are low shock (&lt;1000 g's), cost effective existing designs with proven flight heritage capable of between 6 and 10 metric tons. Push-off systems, preferably internally integrated, should be included. Potential interface diameters being considered include 1575, 2624, and 4394 mm, but NASA is open to other sizes within the 1500 - 5000 mm range. Information on the load and environmental capabilities of available separation systems is sought to assist with evaluation of options for the SLS separation systems.</p>
<p>2. Concepts for separation/push-off systems with up to 40 metric ton capacity, including load and environmental capabilities.</p>
<p>3. Concepts for a mass efficient non-separating PIA structure that would allow a 1575 mm separation system to be used with a 2624 mm payload adapter interface, as shown in Figure 4.</p>
<p>For all areas, responders are requested to assess the compatibility of their designs and processes with applicable NASA requirements listed in Table 1, including factors of safety, and suggest an approach for dealing with differences between their design and construction standards, and those in Table 1.</p>
<p>Responses are requested for, but not limited to, any of the following topics:<br />&bull; Configuration, technology assessment, conceptual design, and capabilities; see Table 2 for specific data requested</p>
<p>&bull; Overview of corporate capabilities and flight history that support the development of separation system concepts and related structures</p>
<p>&bull; Suggested rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) acquisition Engineering Cost Estimate (ECE) including top-level schedule and required funding profiles by fiscal year for two cost categories: Design, Development, Test, and Evaluation (DDT&amp;E) and recurring Production and Operations (P&amp;O). DDT&amp;E and P&amp;O costs are requested to be shown separately, not as one cost.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Proposed long-term affordability considerations that include minimizing variable production costs</p>
<p>&bull; Suggestions for potential cost sharing opportunities between industry and the Government</p>
<p>&bull; Specific NASA or Industry Standard modifications, tailoring, or alternative approaches that your organization recommends for NASA to meet our key metrics of affordability and performance</p>
<p>If a respondent wishes to provide a broader input beyond the topics described below or beyond the technical scope of the hardware described above, then it is requested that such alternate responses be submitted separately. However, if a respondent includes an alternate approach than that described above, the respondent shall identify which, if any, of the constraints above could not be met or would need to be revised to accommodate the alternate approach. The respondent should also identify the cost implications, both impacts and savings, associated with the suggested changes.</p>
<p>Response Instructions</p>
<p>The information obtained will be used by NASA for planning and acquisition strategy development and will be used on a non-attribution basis. Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by NASA for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. The information provided in responses to this RFI will not be made public. NASA does not plan to respond to the individual responses. <br />This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only, and the Government does not presently intend to award a contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. As stipulated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. <br />Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned, and respondents will not be notified of the result of any assessment. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Any responses to this RFI that contain export controlled information should be properly marked as such.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this RFI can be found at https://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this RFI, an ECE is defined as an estimate with line item breakout and rates that provides a financial estimate by fiscal year, to be reported in FY18 dollars.</p>
<p>Sketches have been provided in this RFI for clarification purposes, but are not intended to limit design space. All diagrams are notional mission concepts and subject to change.</p>

<RESPDATE>040518
<CONTACT>Tracy M Bisson, Phone 3019758448, Email tracy.bisson@nist.gov
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
<p>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Scienta Omicron, Inc; 240 St. Paul Street, Suite 301, Denver, CO 80206 for the purchase of a Variable Temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscope (VT STM) for NIST's Single Atom Devices Laboratory of the Engineering Physics Division (EPD). The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The NIST Engineering Physics Division (EPD) requires a Variable Temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscope (VT STM) that can operate with low thermal drift and high imaging/spectroscopy stability to enable advanced performance scanning tunneling imaging, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, patterning, and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. In addition, we need the highest energy resolution, patterning and imaging available to push the fundamental limits of STM patterning and depassivation performance at variable temperatures.</p>
<p>The UHV variable temperature STM will be used to deterministically place phosphorus atoms into Si lattice sites using scanning tunneling microscope to develop a scalable solid state quantum computation system in silicon. The capability of characterizing the phosphorus doped nanostructures in-situ using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) can provide not only full knowledge of the donors' special positions and environment, but also atomically precise mapping of quantum transport properties and donor coupling.  The system must include full UHV capabilities down to 1x10-11 torr and a tip processing station to ensure clean ebeam cleaned and heated tips.</p>
<p>Scienta Omicron Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this product.  The reason is their system is the only one that meets all the minimum technical specifications to include 50K extensibility, scan ranges at room temperature. This system is also the only one with full compatibility and exchangeability with the existing Omicron sample holder, tip holder, tip carrier, and Omicron Matrix/Scala controller compatibility. Market research methods including a sources sought notice posted on FBO indicated that Scienta Omicron Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of a product that meets this requirement.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on April 5, 2018.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to tracy.bisson@nist.gov .  No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: 317nm laser and 461nm Lasers 
<SOLNBR>SB1341-18-RQ-0293
<RESPDATE>040518
<CONTACT>Tracy M Bisson, Phone 3019758448, Email tracy.bisson@nist.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Toptica Photonics, 5847 County Rd. 41, Farmington, NY 14425 for the purchase of a 317nm laser and 461nm Lasers for NIST's Quantum Measurement Division (QMD). The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>NIST requires a Toptica 317nm laser and 461nm Lasers for studying Rydberg interactions in ultra-cold strontium atoms for the purposes creating enhanced interactions for improved metrology.  The Laser Cooling and trapping group in the Quantum Measurement Division (QMD) is building a new capability to study these interactions.  To meet this mission and generate the necessary ultra-cold gases of strontium atoms, a 461nm laser system of a sufficient power, narrow linewidth and stability is required to laser cool the strontium atoms. In order to generate the necessary Rydberg interactions in ultra-cold gases of strontium atoms, a 317nm laser system of a sufficient power, narrow linewidth and stability is required.</p>
<p>Toptica Photonics is the sole source Contractor for this product.  The reason is they are the only company capable of providing lasers with the required specifications needed for the research. These specifications include that the 461nm laser must be able to trap and cool the strontium atoms via  also providing  a single-frequncy laser system with 800mW of light, narrow linewidth. To ensure longterm stability the SHG cavity should have a monolithic design, with auto-alignment of the fundamental beam into the doubling cavity. The 317nm laser must be capable of exciting the Rydberg excitation. For this system we require a single-frequncy laser system with 300mW of light, and narrow linewidth. To ensure longterm stability the SHG and FHG cavities should have a monolithic design, with auto-aligment of the SHG beam into the FHG doubling cavity. Toptica Photonics does not provide these lasers through any of their resellers, so there is only one responsible vendor.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a presolicitation notice for the Concrete Wall Scour Repair project, located at the Townshend Dam, Townshend, Vermont. The project is planned to be issued in April 2018, and will be set aside for Small Businesses. The construction period will extend over Summer and Fall 2018. The estimated magnitude of this project is between $100,000 and $250,000. <br />The location of work to be performed under this contract is the Townshend Dam, located in Townshend, Vermont.</p>
<p>A void (scour pocket) was identified in September 2016 during an underwater inspection near the left concrete gravity wall at the outlet works exit structure at Townshend Dam. The potential failures that could result from an increased advancement of the scour pocket could affect the structural integrity of the concrete gravity wall and the slope stability of the embankment material. The cause of the scour pocket is assumed to be hydraulic based.</p>
<p>This project consists of the following components:</p>
<p>&bull; Dewatering the upstream conduit<br />&bull; Removal of loose debris<br />&bull; Drilling holes for dowel installation into surrounding concrete and bedrock<br />&bull; Installing dowels and grouting into place<br />&bull; Installing forms along front of "plug"<br />&bull; Pumping concrete into the void<br />&bull; Removing forms</p>
<p>This solicitation will be available on or about 4 April 2018. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILALABLE UNTIL THE SOLICITATION IS RELEASED.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov).

<RESPDATE>040518
<CONTACT>Julie Morris, Phone 5095277227, Email Julie.M.Morris@usace.army.mil
<DESC>Construction project entitled: Heise-Roberts Levee Rehabilitation.  The work is located near Rigby, Idaho.  This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract.  100% performance and payment bonds will be required.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $36,500,000.  Solicitation is open to women-owned small business concerns.
<p>Summary of Scope of Work:</p>
<p>There are eight discrete locations along several miles of the Upper Snake River.  Five locations totaling 2,995 feet are found on the left-bank between River Mile 815.4 to 851.0, Jefferson County, Idaho.  Three locations totaling 700 feet are found on the right-bank between River Mile 833.0 to 843.3, Madison County, Idaho.   Where the river impinges the levees, high velocity flows from the 2017 run-off caused significant erosion and riprap displacement.  Construction requires restoring the levee to the as-was condition by re-constructing portions of the levee that eroded away and replacing the armoring on the riverward side.</p>
<p>All eight sites have incurred similar damages.  Riprap on slopes and toes eroded away during spring 2017 high flows.  This has caused the slopes to become steeper than 2H:1V, which are unstable for riprap.  Some riprap remains, but does not constitute a competent revetment surface.  This displaced riprap has exposed the levee shell material underneath which needs to be protected with quarry spalls before riprap placement.  The contractor will cover fill material and exposed levee fill with one foot of quarry spalls and then riprap (2-4' diameter).  The volume of quarry spalls and fill is 13,482 cubic yards and riprap placement 8,738 cubic yards. Riprap will be hauled from a local pit by the contractor to the sites that vary from 4 miles to 14 miles one way.   River depth varies significantly throughout this reach. Some sites could be 12 to 20 feet deep at the toe of riprap placement.  The estimated period of performance is July 2018 - September 2018.</p>
<p>All on-site work shall be performed in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1).</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for establishing and managing an effective on-site Safety and Health program in accordance with EM 385-1-1 that will require the development and submission of a comprehensive project specific Accident Prevention Plan for Government acceptance.  In addition, the contractor will be required to develop and submit for Government acceptance Activity Hazard Analyses for each phase of work and a project specific Fall Protection Plan that comply with EM 385-1-1.</p>
<p>A Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) employed by the prime contractor shall be required for each shift of the contractor's on-site operations.  The SSHO shall possess a minimum of 5-years experience in construction safety on similar projects, shall have completed the 30-Hour OSHA Construction Safety training within the last 5-years, and shall have completed at least 24-hours of formal safety training each year for the past 5-years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The contractor will be required to use the Government-furnished Construction Contractor Module (referred to as QCS) of the Resident Management System (RMS) to record, maintain, and submit various information throughout the contract period.  QCS is a Windows-based program that can be run on a stand-alone personal computer or on a network.  The Government will make the QCS software available to the contractor after contract award.</p>
<p>The project will involve the development and management of contractor furnished submittals for items such as pre-construction plans, product data, test reports, and contract close-out documentation as required by the technical specifications of the contract.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous work within the project includes the delivery of As-Built Drawings and Operations &amp; Maintenance manuals to the customer.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information - Market Research to support Qualified Products List (QPL) of the MC-6 Personnel Parachute System
<p>1. This is not a solicitation for bids/proposals but a Request for Information (RFI). This RFI is not a commercial solicitation per FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>2. This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the Product Manager - Soldier Clothing &amp; Individual Equipment (PM SCIE), through the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Natick Contracting Division (NCD), to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10 to begin Pre-Award Qualifications for the MC-6 Personnel Parachute System in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.2.</p>
<p>3. To be considered for this requirement, respondents are required to submit a Technical and Management Proposal which will be reviewed by the Government. After approval of this proposal, respondents shall submit two (2) complete QPL samples of either the MC-6 system or any components and assemblies they wish to qualify. Both of these submissions are at the respondent's expense. Manufacturers who have previously been on the T-11 or MC-6 QPL may request a waiver on the parts they were previously qualified. Information concerning these submittals is found in the INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF QPL SAMPLE SUBMISSION of this proposal, and in MIL-DTL-6645, paragraph 3.2, Qualification Requirements. QPL sample waiver sample criteria is found in paragraph 2.f of INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF QPL SAMPLE SUBMISSION.</p>
<p>4. Patterns required for the manufacture of the components are available in electronic format (CAD) and will be distributed to all respondents who have a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) on file with the Contracting Officer. Requests for the CAD drawings may be submitted to Mr. G. Mark Whiteman at g.m.whiteman.civ@mail.mil</p>
<p>Non-Disclosure Agreements may be requested from Mr. Matthew Buchanan at matthew.r.buchanan6.civ@mail.mil</p>
<p>5. Respondents must submit their QPL samples in accordance with the Technical Data Package (TDP) and the instructions attached herein. The TDP will be sent upon receipt of the Non-Disclosure Agreement by the Point of Contact (POC).</p>
<p>6. The evaluation of the QPL samples, documentation, and a site inspection is forecast to take up to 8 months per manufacturer. This time frame is dependent on the accuracy and completeness of contractor's proposal and sample submissions.</p>
<p>7. Prospective Manufacturers shall notify the primary POC listed below before shipping any documentation or QPL samples for qualification. To aid in the traceability, timeliness, documentation and processing of the QPL submission, manufacturers should also include the method of shipment and any relevant tracking information.</p>
<p>8. Only manufacturers who are recertified or added to the QPL for the entire system at the time of an anticipated contract award can be considered for award of future Government acquisitions for the MC-6 Personnel Parachute System.</p>
<p>9. Prospective manufacturers are allowed to submit QPL samples for evaluation at any time. For consideration of complete MC-6 system qualification, the samples will not be reviewed until the technical and management proposal is submitted and accepted by the Government. Sample evaluations will occur on a first-delivered, first-served basis.</p>
<p>10. The Government intends to recertify all manufacturers on the QPL for the MC-6 Personnel Parachute Systems every four (4) years. Previously qualified contractors are required to requalify for consideration of future contract awards.</p>
<p>11. PM SCIE is forecasting the award of a Multiple Award 10-year Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity Firm Fixed Price contract for systems in 2FY19; however, this is subject to change.</p>

<p>Automated Vital Signs Monitoring and Patient Biosensors at Naval Medical Center San Diego</p>
<p><br />DISCLAIMER <br />THIS NOTICE IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Solicitation, an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement. This RFI is a request for interested parties to describe their product, technical capabilities, delivery as well as demonstrated tools and processes. All information received in response to this RFI marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned and Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for NMCSD. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>All information received in response to this RFI marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.<br />Purpose:</p>
<p>The Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research for information and planning purposes to determine the existing market capability of businesses that are able to provide the requested equipment, AUTOMATED WIRELESS VITAL SIGNS MONITORING AND/OR PATIENT WEARABLE BIOSENSORS, as specified below, at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD), to include product demonstration at NMCSD - dates to be determined - to have Government employees inspect, request additional information and sample equipment. The Government intends to review all proposed suggestions. All interested, capable, and responsible businesses are encouraged to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND<br />The NMCSD Material Management Department is tasked with conducting market research for automated vital signs biosensors/patient wearable technology. As the inpatient clinical team cares for higher acuity and higher volumes of patients on the inpatient floor, a solution is sought to ensure patients are monitored as continuously as possible while minimizing workload on clinicians and aiding in early identification of patient deterioration. We seek to establish a centralized "Medical Operations Center" where continuous vital signs and patient monitoring data can be used to prevent the problem of "failure to rescue" with such data also used in predictive analytics models for patient safety. Using Government provided space, a select number of potential vendors will be invited to provide product demonstrations including question and answer sessions with hospital staff members. <br />Respondents should identify their product capabilities that would help fulfill the currently specified requirements. The information gathered, if deemed successful, will be used to formulate final requirements, which may subsequently be posted in a solicitation for competitive bids. Currently, our command inpatient wards rely on an intermittent, approximately every four hour vital signs spot-check (Heart Rate, Temperature, Blood Pressure, Respiratory Rate, Pulse oximetry, and assessment of Level of Consciousness). Per hospital criteria, select patients are further monitored via telemetry and/or continuous pulse oximetry. We have established a Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) program that categorizes level of critical or near-critical illness based on these intermittent vital signs data to identify at-risk patients. However, because of the intermittent nature of vital signs checks, there are gaps in earlier detection. The automated technology solution should enhance clinical workflow efficiency. We propose to launch pilot program of Automated Vital Signs wearable biosensors on the ward 4W, with a maximum bed-capacity of 30 patients, average Length of Stay for 4 days, sustainable for at least one year. <br />The description below outlines preliminary requirements for automated vital signs wearable biosensors at NMCSD.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS<br />The Government requests that the contractor or contractors provide Automated Vital Sign Biosensors with the following minimum characteristics:<br />1. Patient wearable and wireless, allowing for freedom of movement <br />2. Single patient use biosensor<br />3. Capability to work with clinical information systems and encrypt data<br />4. Measure Patient Vital Signs: Skin Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respiratory Rate, Pulse Oximetry, Accelerometer/Fall detection<br />5. Local unrestricted access to patient data and ability to use data for predictive analytics.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL PREFERENCE CHARACTERISTICS</p>
<p>1. Cables Are Compatible With Hardwired Monitor Systems;<br />2. Ability To Download Data to Current Monitoring System/Electronic Health Record;</p>
<p>NOTE: This RFI is only soliciting information on Automated Vital Signs Monitoring Patient Biosensors that are able to meet the above requirements. <br />All questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted by email to the Contract Specialist at robert.m.salomon2.civ@mail.mil</p>

Description of Work 
The contractor will develop survey questions to determine wait time for services inside VHA and in the non-VHA market (private healthcare / Medicare / Medicaid).  The contractor will collect wait time information from VHA and non-VHA providers for comparison and provide a report on the differences in wait times for services. The contractor will need to develop questions, identify markets, identify providers and capture responses in 96 markets for seven specialties (family medicine, psychiatry, psychology, urology, gastroenterology, cardiology and orthopedics).  It is estimated that 11,000 to 14,000 surveys will need to be completed.  The period of performance is expected to be 200 days.  
Technical Requirements 
Ideally, the contractor should have experience performing surveys of wait times for Government-provided medical services and medical services provided by private healthcare.  Having an understanding of VHA specialty and primary care scheduling processes and experience reporting findings to VHA leadership and Congressional committees would also be beneficial.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is seeking capability statements and any teaming arrangements, such as mentor/prot&eacute;g&eacute; program and/or joint venture arrangements from all interested parties, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for a full and open competition for support for the Marshall Operations Systems, Services and Integration (MOSSI) acquisition at MSFC. The Government reserves the right to conduct a Small, 8(a), Women-Owned (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto.<br /><br />This acquisition will combine the efforts of the current MSFC Mission Operations &amp; Integration (MO&amp;I) and Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC) contracts. The MOSSI acquisition will provide support and products for the development and execution of spaceflight operations that are the responsibility of the Payload and Mission Operations Division (PMOD) within the Human Exploration Development and Operations (HEDO) Office. Customer and stake-holder support is provided for mission ground systems development and operations in support of NASA programs, project offices, staff offices, NASA contractors, payload developers, educational institutions, international partner space agencies, and individuals within these organizations. Other private and public industry companies with capabilities for new space markets are also potential customers.<br /><br />The scope of the MOSSI effort includes all life-cycle phases (A-F) for capability and operations development, implementation, and close-out. The selected contractor will be tasked to provide operations support for all mission phases (e.g., planning, testing, simulations, pre-launch, ascent, checkout, mission operations, de-orbit and descent, landing and post-landing, system sustaining, decommissioning). The MOSSI core mission service provides payload operations support to the International Space Station (ISS) Program. Support will also be required for new or evolving NASA programs including Space Launch System (SLS) and other satellite projects.<br /><br />The contractor will perform International Space Station (ISS) Payload operations and will provide the capability to accomplish preparation, planning, training, and execution of on-orbit payload operations and post-flight and post-increment functions.<br />MOSSI includes the management, development, and implementation of the Payload Operations Integration Center (POIC) major Information Technology (IT) investment as defined by Office of Management and Budget (OMB).<br /><br />The development activities involved in this contract will encompass the entire life-cycle of ground systems development. Typical activities include: operations concept analysis; requirements definition and analysis, design, development, test, and implementation.<br />The systems operations and maintenance functions include: sustaining engineering of developed systems for both local and remote locations; operations activity preparation and simulation; mission evaluation activities; hardware and software maintenance; systems and facilities operations; data collection, processing, distribution, and storage; decommission, transition, and close-out of all systems.<br /><br />This work is presently being integrated by the Government and is performed under two separate contracts; the Mission Operations &amp; Integration (MO&amp;I) contract NNM13AA29C with Teledyne Brown Engineering, and the Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC) contract NNM17AA12C with COLSA Corporation. <br /><br />Attached separately is a draft version of the MOSSI performance work statement (PWS) and a listing of capacity parameters that may be used for understanding the complexity of the effort. Interested parties are requested to provide comments on the PWS requirements document. Of particular interest are comments relative to the management and technical integration of the effort along with the management of a major IT investment. <br /><br />Interested parties are requested to submit statements of experience relevant to the attached PWS. Including but not limited to the following areas: Human spaceflight operations and integration experience; High-risk, hazardous human operations and integration activities in remotely-controlled closed environments other than space; or Unmanned spaceflight operations and integration experience. Interested parties are also requested to submit capability statements relative to the socioeconomic categories specified in this notice (or resubmit if previously submitted) demonstrating the capability of the potential offeror and potential teaming partners to successfully perform and integrate the technical requirements to maximize efficiency and reduce costs. Previously submitted statements may be resubmitted with any changes to the previous submission highlighted for ease of reference.<br /><br />The size standard for the established NAICS code of 541715 is 1,250 employees.<br /><br />The estimated award date for this contract is late FY2019. <br /><br />No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation.
<p>The requirement is not only considered a commercial type service. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited or provided. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. All responses shall be submitted to Jane Thomas-Bush, Contracting Officer at jane.thomas.bush@nasa.gov, telephone (256) 961-2117.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with eLearning Brothers, LLC for eleven (11) Master Package software license renewals and the procurement of two (2) additional licenses for the National Weather Service (NWS) Training Center (NTC) in Kansas City, MO for the base period of performance of March 30, 2018 - March 29, 2019, plus up to four, one-year option periods.
<p>Justification for Sole Source<br />NOAA/NWS has a requirement to renew their current eleven (11) eLearning Brothers Master Package license and add two (2) additional licenses to meet the increase in in NTC staff needs.   The NWS NTC currently uses this software to develop and maintain training modules for NWS employees.  NTC staff uses eLearning Brothers Master Package to create and maintain multiple types of products which support both in class and online class materials for NWS employees.  Current projects in use by NTC using these licenses include New Hire Orientation, M&amp;S course material, and DSS Boot Camp among others.</p>
<p>ELearning Brothers, LLC is the sole proprietor and distributer of the Master Package software license.  This subscription software provides an all-encompassing solution for most of the photos, illustrations, templates, and pre-made interactions for a variety of eLearning development software including HTML5 based scripts, Articulate, Camtasia, and Captivate.  The government does not know of any other subscription service that offers the full range of capabilities presented by eLearning Master Package.</p>
<p>Not renewing and adding the licenses will result in slowed productivity by the NTC and delayed delivery of important training to NWS employees.  Additionally, NTC would lose the training documents already stored and use via eLearning Brothers Master Package.  Furthermore, it would severely inhibit the ability of NTC to develop online training for the Fiscal Year 2018 and beyond.  These software licenses will give the NTC staff collaborative access to this software.</p>
<p>Sources Sought<br />This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide the data service may submit substantiating documentation in writing within five (5) days of this notice.  Responses can be sent via e-mail to elliott.waxman@noaa.gov.  Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>DOC, Eastern Region Acquisition Division requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM).  No award can be made to a company not registered in SAM.  For additional information and to register in SAM, please access the following web site:  www.sam.gov.

The information provided in this notice is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.  The Government will not provide debriefs on the results of this research, but feedback regarding the decision to set aside or not set aside the procurement will be accomplished via pre-solicitation synopsis or solicitation for these services, as applicable.

<RESPDATE>040418
<CONTACT>Clint Sade, Phone 2024338426, Email clint.sade@ssp.navy.mil
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice supporting Market Research. This notice is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation exists at this time. The Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) seeks a contract on a sole-source basis in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.15 with a certified Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) for subject matter expertise regarding Open Skies (OS) post-flight assessments (PFA) products and imagery effectiveness. The anticipated NAICS code for this requirement is 541690- Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.
<p>The assigned NAICS code is one in which the Small Business Administration (SBA) has determined that WOSB concerns are substantially underrepresented in Federal procurement, as specified on the SBA's Web site at http://www.sba.gov/WOSB and as further defined in FAR Subpart 19.15 - Women-Owned Small Business Program. Therefore, SSP is hereby requesting only qualifying WOSBs (including Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) concerns) respond to the following market research tool for the collection and analyses of information to determine WOSB/EDWOSB's capability to provide the subject requirement, as stipulated in the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF NOTICE: The Sources Sought is being used as a Market Research tool to determine potential sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a possible RFP. The Government is not obligated and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. Responses are strictly voluntary. We are only requesting capability statements from potential contractors at this time.</p>
<p>Responders should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly. Failure to provide a response does not preclude participation in any possible future RFP for which a business is eligible to participate in, if any is issued. It is the responsibility of the interested businesses to monitor the FEDBIZOPS website for additional information pertaining to any potential acquisition and provide security clearances, if necessary, to perform efforts within the Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: Per SECNAVINST 5710.26, the Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) and Director of the Naval Treaty Implementation Program (NTIP) ensures that Open Skies (OS) post-flight assessment (PFA) products are generated following each OS overflight of the United States (U.S.). These products evaluate imagery of Department of the Navy (DON) activities to determine the effectiveness of precautionary measures and provide feedback to activities where a concern may exist. OS overflights of the U.S. are typically conducted by the Russian Federation. The contractor must provide support to NTIP for imagery analysis, consisting of two (2) full-time equivalent (FTE) support personnel for this effort. It is intended that the contractor will be supporting approximately seven (7) to ten (10) overflights per calendar year. However, additional support may be required for another FTE, pending mission requirement changes. Consequently, the level-of-effort anticipated to support this effort is for 3,840 man-hours per year (2 FTEs assuming a burdened 1,920 man-year). An additional 1,920 man-hours/level of effort may also be required or included in the resultant contract per year, if overflight requirements increase. Although NTIP is located within SSP Headquarters in Washington, DC, the primary location for the actual work will be at the Open Skies Media Processing Facility at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton Ohio. The contractor shall ensure personnel are skilled in imagery analysis for electro-optical digital imagery, infrared, and synthetic aperture radar and that they maintain and keep these skills up-to-date, as technology emerges or changes.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The current proposed period of performance is estimated to be one base year plus four (4) option years, starting in FY 2019.</p>
<p>RESPONSE DEADLINE: Interested sources shall submit a capability package by 2 P.M. EST Wednesday, March 4, 2018 within 12 pages or less containing: 1) company name and address, 2) company point of contact, 3) email address, 4) phone number, 5) company capability specifics addressing each task statement within the PWS, 6) a current list of related past performance within the past 5 years. Proposed contractor support must have a SECRET clearance or higher.</p>
<p>Electronic responses are acceptable if prepared in Microsoft 2010 compatible format or newer or Adobe PDF. Email electronic responses to the POC listed below with "Sources Sought 119OSIS1" in the subject line of the email.</p>

HYPACK is a hydrographic software package that provides all the tools necessary to complete a hydrographic, side-scan, ADCP, and magnetometer survey.  HYSWEEP is fully integrated into HYPACK as an additional module that is specifically needed for multi-beam calibration, data collection, and data processing. Ongoing hydrograph GIS missions at UMESC require the purchase of additional HYPACK/HYSWEEP software modules due to their compatibility with already owned UMESC hydro-acoustic equipment.  HYSWEEP is fully integrated to almost all multi-beam systems, which provides flexibility when purchasing different multi-beam and side-scan sonar systems.  UMESC relies on HYPACK/HYSWEEP software modules for conducting crucial hydro-acoustic surveys used in the collection of data for developing high resolution bathymetry, river sedimentation changes, and benthic habitat maps.  Two additional HYPACK/HYSWEEP software licenses are needed in FY 2018 to keep up with the additional hydro-acoustic, side-scan, and multi-beam data processing being performed by UMESC staff in support of multiple ongoing research projects both during and beyond FY 2018.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

The Contractor shall provide Basic Life Support (BLS) Ambulance Service and Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS/ALS) Ambulance Service, as specified herein, for eligible beneficiaries of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Ann Arbor Medical Center (VA), 2215 Fuller Rd, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48105 including its Community Based Outpatient Clinics. Services shall be provided on a twenty-four hour per day, seven day per week basis.

The Contractor shall perform required services in accordance with the standards of the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services (CAAS) http://www.caas.org/ and established principles and ethics of the medical profession.

The contractor shall transact all business, there under, with the Contracting Officer (CO) and/or the Contracting Officer s Representative (COR) or his/her designee, and in no case shall deal directly with or solicit from beneficiaries of VA.
1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
(a) The services of this contract shall be used primarily for but not limited to; trips between the Ann Arbor VA Medical Center including its Community Based Outpatient Clinics, other VA medical centers, clinics both inside and outside of the state of Michigan, The University of Michigan Medical Center, Transportation to and from nursing homes, and patient homes both within and outside Washtenaw county, MI may be covered under this contract on a limited basis.  The VA does not guarantee any of these estimated quantities or any percentage of these estimated quantities; however, it is believed they are a realistic expectation of our requirements for the period of this contract.
(b) Contractor shall provide or subcontract at contract rates all requests for SMT transport received from the Ann Arbor VA medical center and its Community Based Outpatient Clinics including but not limited to transportation requirements both locally and from outlying areas. In addition, the Contractor shall make available as needed a bariatric cot which shall be provided to VA, when requested by VA.
(c) Contractor shall notify the COR as soon as possible of those instances in which the Contractor knows that he will be unable to provide the required service at any specific time.  This notice shall enable the VA to secure the service elsewhere to meet the requirements.  In the event the Contractor has the required number of BLS/ALS ambulances out on service runs for this Medical Center, the Contractor shall be required to sub-contract to other providers to ensure SMT transportation services are provided. 
(d) Immediate Notification: It is the responsibility of the Contractor to immediately notify the AAVAMC ordering office when unable to make a pick-up or delivery by the exact time specified for previously scheduled trips; or unable to dispatch an ambulance to a designated pick-up point within the required time frame for unscheduled requests for services.  The immediate notification shall include the reason for the delay and whether the pick-up or delivery can be made at a later time and if so, specification of that time.  However, it shall be the  sole discretion of the AAVAMC ordering office to accept the later pick-up or delivery time, and based upon the reason for delay, present the delay for payment reduction or refuse the later pick-up or delivery time and order the services from another source (the applicable ordering office shall be the sole entity for determining when to request the services from another source), and present the reason for the delay to the CO as an occurrence that may be subject to default.  Based upon the reason for the delay, the Contractor may be charged with excess costs incurred by the AAVAMC in ordering the service from another source or other appropriate contractual action may be taken by AAVAMC.  However, if the Contractor states that he/she will provide additional ambulance(s) upon a specific request of the VA and is unable to provide the additional ambulance(s) within one hour of the request, and if the Contractor fails to notify the VA ordering officer of this inability to so provide, the Contractor shall be required to pay any difference in costs.  Failure to notify the VA of any instance of inability to provide a required ambulance may reflect upon the Contractor s ability to perform under this contract and may constitute sufficient cause for termination of the existing contract.
(e) For purposes of clarification, the Contractor shall be responsible for having sufficient BLS/ALS ambulances and qualified personnel to meet the estimated annual requirements of this Medical Center.  The Contractor shall not be required to maintain a standby group of vehicles at any one time, but should use good business judgment in having sufficient BLS/ALS ambulances to best meet our estimated requirements.  If the Contractor provides more than the minimum number of vehicles required by this contract at any time, upon a specific request of VA during the contract period, the Contractor shall charge and VA will pay for such additional services only in accordance with the prices or rate of the Schedule by the Contractor.

Ambulance Transportation Services:
The Contractor shall be responsible for providing all vehicles and personnel, necessary to meet all ACLS/ ALS and BLS transport requirements of this Contract.  The Contractor shall be authorized to utilize another ambulance service company, as a subcontractor (certified to be within all requirements of this Contract) to complete these transportation requests only if prior approval for the subcontractor has been received from the CO.  The Government has a business relationship with the Prime Contractor only.  Only the Prime Contractor may bill the Government for services.  All bills for this subcontractor service will be paid directly to the Prime Contractor at the Contract rate, and the Prime Contractor shall make payment to the subcontractor at their agreed rate.  In the event the Contractor is unable to perform services or have services performed as required, the Contractor shall immediately notify the COR and provide a justification for non-performance.  The VA reserves the right to re-procure services which cannot be performed by the Contractor, in accordance with the terms, conditions, and schedule of this Contract.  The Contractor is responsible for excess re-procurement costs which may result from the Contractor s inability to perform the required service.  Payment of re-procurement costs shall not relieve the Contractor from any other provision in this Contract covering inspection, acceptance and deductions from payment.  The VA will be the sole judge in determining when services will be re-procured.  The failure of the Contractor to perform services within the required time frames and in accordance with terms and conditions may also provide cause for termination of the Contract for  cause,  (see FAR clause 52.212-4(m)). 

Vehicle Response Times:  
The Contractor shall be at AAVAMC or its Community Based Outpatient Clinics within 30 minutes after notification for an Emergency Advanced Cardiac Life Support/Advanced Life Support Transport (ACLS/ALS) and/or Emergency Basic Life Support Life Support (BLS) vehicle.  Exceptions to the 20-minute expectation (i.e., weather emergencies, traffic emergencies, etc.) will be investigated and analyzed, including the identification of corrective actions if applicable.  As determined appropriate, Contractor shall take corrective actions to ensure timely response. The Contractor shall respond to all calls immediately for emergency ground ambulance transport service for the AAVA Medical Center.  The Ann Arbor VA Medical Center contractor shall provide and respond to all emergency calls in accordance with Federal, State, and Local regulations, governing dispatch of emergency medical (ambulance) vehicles and medical care of on-board Patients, to include the use of sirens and other measures to ensure timely arrival at the designated VA Medical facility.

The Contractor shall be at AAVAMC or its Community Based Outpatient Clinics within 60 minutes after notification for ground ambulance transport service for a Non-Emergency Advanced Cardiac Life Support/Advanced Life Support (ACLS/ ALS) vehicle and/or Non-Emergency Basic Life Support Vehicle (BLS).  Exceptions to this time requirement will be assessed similar to paragraph 1 above. 

Response Time Compliance Rate: The Contractor shall maintain, at a minimum, a 95% compliance rate on responses to pick-up or deliver during the Contract year.  Failure of the Contractor to perform in accordance with this compliance rating may constitute sufficient cause for termination of the Contract for  cause,  (see FAR clause 52.212-4(m)) or other appropriate contractual action

If the time period for pick-up, stated herein, is physically impossible due to location of Patient, the Contractor shall contact the COR and inform him/her of the anticipated time required for pick-up and delivery of said Patient.

Should the VA determine that immediate transportation is essential to prevent loss of life or serious bodily harm, transportation services may be procured without referral to the ambulance Contractor.  However, in these extremely rare cases, no charge shall be levied against the Contractor.
BASIC LIFE SUPPORT (BLS) ambulances shall be staffed, at a minimum, with two EMTs.  Ambulance shall be on-site within one (1) hour after Contractor receives a request for BLS ambulance.  The contractor shall be required to provide a minimum of three BLS ambulances at any given time; however, additional ambulances requested shall be furnished, if available, and at the contract price.

ADVANCED CARDIOVASCULAR LIFE SUPPORT (ACLS) ambulance shall be staffed with two attendants.  One shall be a Paramedic and the other shall be a Paramedic or Certified Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with controlling capabilities for Endotracheal Intubation, IV Therapy, Cardiac Monitoring, Defibrillation, and Drug Therapy.   Ambulance shall be on-site within thirty (30) minutes after Contractor receives a request for ACLS ambulance.  The contractor shall be required to provide a minimum of one ACLS ambulance at any given time; however, additional ambulances requested shall be furnished, if available, and at the contract price.

Authorized Medical Center Personnel: Prior to performance, the COR shall provide the Contractor with a list of names or position titles and phone numbers of authorized Government personnel who may request services and receive calls from Contractor regarding Contract performance.  This list will be updated and submitted to the Contractor as changes occur.  The Contractor shall ensure that requests for services are received from authorized medical center personnel.  Services rendered in response to requests from other than authorized personnel shall be at the risk of the Contractor and any cost related thereto shall be borne by the Contractor.
Mileage Threshold for Ground Ambulance Services:  The Mileage Threshold for the AAVAMC is a 25 mile radius from the designated pick-up point for each trip (i.e., Contractor is required to pick-up Patient at the VA, the Mileage Threshold would be a 25 mile radius from the VA).  Charges for travel within this Mileage Threshold shall be inclusive with the base rate.  One way mileage for travel beyond the 25 mile Mileage Threshold shall be claimed under the applicable mileage rate.
Contractor Reimbursement:
Reimbursement for mileage outside the Contract Mileage Threshold of coverage, shall be at the mileage rate stated in the price schedule, and shall be based upon the miles from the pick-up point to the specified destination.  Any mileage from the place of business and/or location of vehicle and the pick-up point, or from the delivery destination back to the place of business and/or location of next trip are not considered as a separate item of this reimbursement, but would be expected to be incorporated into the mileage rate that is the Contractor s responsibility as part of the administrative costs (or costs of doing business).  Trip mileage under the contract shall be determined by using the internet web site of Bing Maps; Google Maps will be used when Bing Maps is not available.  Allowable charges for mileage outside the Contract Mileage Threshold areas of coverage shall not exceed +5% of the current Rand McNally Standard Mileage Guide.
Should the VA make a determination that a previously scheduled trip may be cancelled, and a vehicle has already been dispatched to the designated pick-up point, VA may notify the Contractor to cancel the order.  For orders that are cancelled while the Contractor is already in route to the designated pick-up, the Contractor shall be entitled to receive cancellation rate for the trip, as provided in Schedule of Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs.  This charge shall not include any mileage charge.
If the Contractor fails to meet the time requirements in this Contract, AAVAMC will not be charged for these instances. 
Other Charges:  It is understood that the prices listed in the accepted Schedule of Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs shall be inclusive of all ferry, bridge, tunnel or road toll charges.  Contractor shall not bill the VA for any such separate charges. If the Contractor s place of business is located beyond the local telephone call zone of the VA, the Contractor agrees to accept telephone orders for service on a collect basis.  It is estimated that approximately seventy (70) orders will be placed by telephone per month.

WAITING TIME:  For time lost in waiting at either or both ends of a trip, due to causes beyond their control, the Contractor shall be reimbursed at the rate set forth in the Pricing Schedule, for each quarter hour in excess of the first quarter hour from the time the Contractor reports to the designated person.

<SOLNBR>DEAC0909SR22505(3)
<RESPDATE>040518
<CONTACT>Cynthia Hughes, Contract Specialist, Phone 8039529355, Email cynthia.hughes@srs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Operations Office (SR) intends to extend the current contract with Savannah River Remediation, LLC (SRR) at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The current contract with SRR ends May 31, 2018, and is anticipated to be extended for up to ten (10) months, from June 1, 2018, through March 31, 2019. This proposed extension will enable DOE-SR to continue critical requirements for treatment and disposal of liquid waste at SRS while DOE supports the Government Accountability Office protest process and fosters competition for award of a new Liquid Waste (LW) contract.
<p>The proposed extension is based upon the exclusion found at Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 and 41 United States Code 3304(a)(1), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the limited time frame. To DOE's knowledge, only SRR has the requisite knowledge, experience and capability to provide these critical, highly specialized services without interruption during the acquisition cycle for transition to a new contract. Essentially, SRR is the only company qualified to show a new contractor the current operational parameters of the LW system.</p>
<p>THERE ARE NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested, responsible sources may submit information about their capability to perform this requirement, which shall be considered by the agency. Capability statements must be received by the response date and time of this notice. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount:  The estimated amount of this procurement is $23,226.50, which has been certified on Purchase Request No.: 655-18-2-036-0128 to purchase (41) Units, Irradiated Blood Platelets.

 These Irradiated Blood Platelets are used during scheduled surgical procedures and in  the treatment of patients.  This item will be purchased from Michigan Blood, 1771  Tittabawassee Road, Saginaw, MI 48604-9341
 The item is required to be delivered on or before February 11, 2019
Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:  
 This facility needs blood products. This specific need is for irradiated blood  platelets. The product must be available to this institution within 60 minutes of order  per Directive 2010-018 Facility Infrastructure Requirements to Perform Standard,  Intermediate, or Complex Surgical Procedures. 
 In addition, the blood product must meet all applicable FDA and AABB requirements  for blood products. The product must come  from non-paid donors.  
 Michigan Blood is the only vendor that can currently meet the requirement pertaining  to the delivery within 60 minutes of the order being placed for irradiated blood  platelets.  This is an emergent procurement request.  
Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:  Reviewed FPDS-NG, GSA, MedSurg Online Catalogs, NAC, for vendors with related items without success. A google search was also conducted only to provide ineffective results.  There are currently no SDVOSB or VOSB organizations that are authorized to distribute this proprietary product.  This is an emergent procurement.   

Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

These buildings are available for outlease under the EUL or Historic Reuse Program (HRP). The EUL and/or HRP projects are to be a long-term outlease or exchange. 

The historic reuse authority is derived from Title 54 United States Code Sections 306121-306122 (formerly Section 111) that allows the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to manage, outlease, or exchange historic facilities (available land, buildings, and other resources) in a manner consistent with VA s obligation to maintain historic assets. VA s implementation of this authority is known as the Historic Reuse Program or HRP.  An HRP agreement can be either a long-term outlease (up to 99 years) of facilities under VA s jurisdiction of control to a public or private sector entity or an exchange of historic properties.  This program is administrated by the Land Acquisition Strategic Utilization service (LASU) within the Office of Construction and Facilities Management s Office of Real Property (ORP).

Enhanced Use Lease Authority :, Title 38 United States Code Sections 8161-8169, allows the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to outlease facilities (available land, buildings, and other resources) to provide supportive housing that engages tenants in on-site and community-based support services for Veterans or their families who are at risk of homelessness or are homeless.   Enhanced-Use Leases are long-term leases (up to 75 years) of facilities under VA s jurisdiction of control to the public or private sector for veteran supportive housing. This program is administrated by VA s Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM).
The objective of this development opportunity includes but is not limited to:
To provide an innovative solution within current authority to preserve a VA-owned, historic property;
To enable a productive use of these properties that do not involve VA capital dollars and benefits all stakeholders; and
To meet VA s obligations under Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) to better preserve and protect the property. 

To maximize achievement of these objectives VA may execute its authority to lease the Subject Property for cash or historic preservation services, or exchange the Subject Property for other comparable historic real property, or any combination thereof.

Firms must hold appropriate licensure for these jurisdictions. The value of most projects is generally between $500,000 and $10,000,000. Several facilities are designated as historic properties, landmarks, or memorials. Most WHS construction projects are completed under MACC IDIQ task order awards.</p>
<p>The majority of the work is performed in the DC Metro Area including the Pentagon, Mark Center, and leased spaces in Arlington, VA. Some projects are performed at the Raven Rock Mountain Complex (RRMC) in Adams County, PA, and outlying properties in Washington County, MD.</p>
<p>Types of projects may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Renovation within occupied commercial and industrial buildings <br />&bull; Sustainment, restoration, and modernization of existing facilities and infrastructures <br />&bull; Design and installation of furniture, fixtures and equipment <br />&bull; Installation of energy management controls as necessary to provide turn-key construction solutions<br />&bull; Renovation and/or installation of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems <br />&bull; Exterior work, to include concrete and limestone installation or repair, and asphalt paving</p>
<p>Projects often require construction contractors to team, partner with, or subcontract Architect-Engineering (A-E) Design Firm(s) to provide design, development, and coordination of projects. Task orders may have specialized design and construction experience required.</p>

The contractor and design team(s) will have to maintain their facility clearance throughout the duration of the contract.</p>
<p>2. Bonding and performance&nbsp;capacity. Provide your firm's bonding capacity for single awards and in total. Describe&nbsp;your firm's available performance capacity in terms of annual dollars and projects. (For example, the firm could accommodate approximately "X" new projects valued between $X and $X per year after considering existing obligations).</p>

<p>5. Experience: Submit three (3) Design-Build or Design-Bid-Build projects with a completed value between $1 million and $10 million to demonstrate experience in performing efforts of a similar size, scope and complexity (new construction or major renovation) completed within the last seven (7) years. To establish the breadth of experience for multiple project types, at least one new construction and one major renovation project should be included. One project should demonstrate experience in the design and construction of a project that received third-party certification from an organization with an auditable process such as LEED, Green Globes, or similar.</p>
<p>Submissions&nbsp;should contain the following items for each project:</p>
<p>&bull; Include Contract Number, if applicable<br />&bull; Indicate whether Prime contractor or Subcontractor<br />&bull; Contract Value<br />&bull; Completion Date<br />&bull; Government Agency <br />&bull; Project Description.

<p><strong>DOI-AAAP-0050 Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (Feb 2016)</strong><br />a. FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation. One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15.<br />b. The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS. CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report. Once the report is processed, it is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past performance as part of a source selection action.<br />c. We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer (CO) with the name, position title, phone number, and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s) for the contract no later than 30 days after award. Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the Contractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before returning the report to the Assessing Official (AO). Information in the report must be protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.<br />d. When your Contractor Representative(s) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically generated email with detailed login instructions. Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS is available at https://www.cpars.gov/. <br />e. Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the AO will complete an interim or final past performance evaluation, and the report will be accessible at https://www.cpars.gov/.  <br /> 1. Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the evaluation without comment. <br /> 2. Your comments should focus on objective facts in the AO's narrative and should provide your views on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance. <br /> 3. All information provided should be reviewed for accuracy prior to submission. <br /> 4. If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating No comment in the space provided, and then selecting "Accept the Ratings and Close the Evaluation".<br /> 5. Your response is due within 60 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR. On day 15, the evaluation will become available in PPIRS-RC marked as "Pending" with or without comments and whether or not it has been closed.<br /> 6. If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 60 days, it will automatically be returned to the Government and will be annotated: -The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date). The contractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment.- <br />f. The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:<br /> 1. Protect the evaluation as source selection information. After review, transmit the evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS. If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contact the CO for instructions.<br /> 2. Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization. Ensure the evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of your control.<br /> 3. Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, pre-award surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.<br />g. If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the CO no later than seven days following your receipt of the evaluation. The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or other means during your 60-day review period.<br />h. A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.<br />(End of Local Clause)</p>

<DESC>CAFB is looking for a comprehensive project to achieve energy assurance and resiliency while making progress towards its energy intensity goals in line with EO 13693, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 8287, and the DOE Third-Generation ESPC IDIQ contract. By enhancing energy assurance, CAFB will make progress towards meeting Air Force and Federal mandates to reduce energy use intensity and increase use of renewable energy. To achieve its energy and water conservation goals, CAFB is interested in any Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) defined in Attachment J-3 of the DOE Third-Generation ESPC IDIQ contract, with the exception of two (2) technical categories: TC.15 - Energy Cost Reduction through Rate Adjustments and TC.20 - Future ECMs. CAFB, along with any other ESCO-identified opportunity, is specifically interested in evaluating the following ECMs: TC.1 - Boiler Plant Improvements, TC.2 - Chiller Plant Improvements, TC.3 - Building Automation Systems (BAS)/Energy Management Control Systems (EMCS), TC.4 - Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning, TC.5 - Lighting Improvements, and TC.10 - Distributed Generation. CAFB has included 215 buildings with a total of 2,984,704 square feet available for inclusion in this project. The intent is to optimize the combination of conservation measures (with various levels of cost and savings) to achieve more substantial energy savings within a given facility. The selected ESCO is required to perform all operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of all installed ECMs for the life of the contract, as required by 42 U.S.C. &sect; 8287.

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE</p>
<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employee referred to IHS through this contract.</p>
<p>Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being performed under this contract<br /><br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>Acceptance Period: Your proposal must stipulate that is predicated upon all terms and conditions of this RFP. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

Provision 52.212-2  Evaluation-Commercial Items (Oct 2014) applies to this acquisition.   <br /> (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /> <br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;<br /><br />(ii) price;<br /><br />Award shall be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror.<br />To be considered a technically acceptable solution for a parts procurement, the quoted parts shall meet the solicitation requirements including required parts, delivery dates, and terms and conditions stated in the solicitation.

<p>A past performance evaluation will be conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b) (3).  The Government intends to utilize the Government wide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for the past performance evaluation as a basis for anticipating successful/unsuccessful performance on this required effort.  To be considered acceptable for past performance, a search of the PPIRS shall reveal no negative past performance information for the recent and relevant records.  In the event that there are no recent and/or relevant PPIRS records, the quoter' s past performance record shall be considered "unknown."

To be considered recent, the effort must have been completed within the previous three (3) years from date of this draft award notice.

At the quoter's discretion, additional past performance information may be submitted with the quote as a supplement to PPIRS.  If furnished, this submission will be evaluated in accordance with the procedures described above.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate quoted pricing for reasonableness utilizing techniques described in FAR 13.106-3.  <br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the <br />total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br /><br />10.

<p>(1)	The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2)	The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3)	The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4)	The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1)	Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2)	Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3)	Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b)	The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i)	If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A)	Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011	Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a)  Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b)  If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO.	SUPPLIES/SERVICE	QUANTITY	UNIT	UNIT PRICE	AMOUNT<br />0001	Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse	20	EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.   Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.  If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).  The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.  The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.  The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.  The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.  This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2)	The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i)	If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3)	The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1)	The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011	Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a)  Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b)  If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO.	SUPPLIES/SERVICE	QUANTITY	UNIT	UNIT PRICE	AMOUNT<br />0001	Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse	20	EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable <br />clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.<br /> <br />(m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall--<br /> <br />(1) Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The <br />Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and<br /> <br />(2) Require subcontractors to--<br /> <br />(i) Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and<br /> <br />(ii) Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>252.204-7011	Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a)  Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b)  If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO.	SUPPLIES/SERVICE	QUANTITY	UNIT	UNIT PRICE	AMOUNT<br />0001	Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse	20	EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.   Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.  If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<p>(1)	The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2)	The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3)	The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4)	The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1)	Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2)	Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3)	Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b)	The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i)	If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A)	Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011	Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a)  Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b)  If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO.	SUPPLIES/SERVICE	QUANTITY	UNIT	UNIT PRICE	AMOUNT<br />0001	Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse	20	EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.   Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.  If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).  The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.  The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.  The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.  The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.  This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
