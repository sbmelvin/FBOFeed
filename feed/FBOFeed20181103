<ARCHDATE>03082019
<CONTACT>Grant Knutson, Sr. Program Officer, Phone 2027726495, Email knutsongm@mcc.gov
<DESC>The United States of America, acting through the Millennium Challenge Corporation ("MCC") and the Government of Mongolia (the "Government") have entered into a Millennium Challenge Compact for Millennium Challenge Account assistance to help facilitate poverty reduction through economic growth in Mongolia (the "Compact") in the amount of approximately 350 million USD ("MCC Funding"). The Government, acting through the National Secretariat for the Development of the Second Compact Agreement between the Government of Mongolia and the US Millennium Challenge Corporation ("National Secretariat") and later through the Millennium Challenge Account - Mongolia ("MCA-Mongolia") (either, the "MCA Entity"), intends to apply a portion of the MCC Funding to eligible payments under a contract for which this Request for Proposals ("RFP") is issued. Any payments made by the MCA Entity under the proposed contract will be subject, in all respects, to the terms and conditions of the Compact and related documents, including restrictions on the use and distribution of MCC Funding. No party other than the Government and the MCA Entity shall derive any rights from the Compact or have any claim to the proceeds of MCC Funding. The Compact and its related documents can be found on the MCC website (www.mcc.gov) and, once established, on the website of the MCA Entity.
<p>The 350 million USD Compact addresses one of the country's most binding constraints to economic growth: costly access to water and sanitation. The Compact will assist the Government in meeting the projected demand for water in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar for residential consumers and commercial and industrial users through a Water Supply Project, consisting of three closely related investment activities:<br />&bull; A Downstream Wells Activity, to construct new groundwater wells with attendant transmission lines, reservoirs, and an advanced water purification plant;<br />&bull; A Wastewater Recycling Activity, to construct a new wastewater recycling plant and pipelines to provide high-quality treated wastewater that can be used instead of fresh water by water-intensive industries, thereby increasing the amount of fresh water available for household consumption; and<br />&bull; A Water Sector Sustainability Activity, to support policy reforms, capacity building, and technical assistance to improve the long-term sustainability of Ulaanbaatar's water supply.</p>
<p>The Government has authorized the National Secretariat, a unit in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to represent it. On behalf of the Government, the National Secretariat conducts this procurement for the consultancy services to perform program management, design management and construction supervision for the Water Supply Project. At a later date, the Government expects the MCA-Mongolia to assume certain responsibilities from the National Secretariat and to oversee implementation of the Compact.</p>
<p>This SPN for RFP follows a General Procurement Notice that appeared in dgMarket, UNDB Online, and Mongolian daily newspapers National Post and Today on July 09, 2018.</p>
<p>The National Secretariat now invites proposals from legally constituted consulting firms to provide the consulting services referenced above ("Proposals"). More details on these consulting services are provided in the Terms of Reference. This RFP is open to all eligible entities ("Consultants") that wish to respond. Subject to restrictions noted in the RFP, consultants may associate with other consulting firms to enhance their capacity to successfully carry out the assignment. Please note that the Government has also released a RFP for Consulting Services for the Preparation of Detailed Designs/ESIA/RAP for the Bulk Water Supply Expansion. The Consultant or (Consultants) that perform the services requested in that RFP will be excluded from providing supervision services or design review services in the contract to be awarded as a result of this procurement.</p>
<p>Through this Request for Proposals ("RFP"), the Government intends to hire a consultant to serve as (i) the program manager for pre-construction, construction and construction related activities and (ii) the employer's technical representative for the infrastructure projects and construction supervision engineer for MCA-Mongolia, a special purpose entity that it will establish to oversee and manage the implementation of all aspects of the Compact. This consultant will be called the Program Management Consultant ("PMC"). The role of the PMC will be:<br />&bull; Program Management: To support MCA-Mongolia in managing and implementing all the components of the Water Supply Project; in developing clear reporting lines; and in ensuring high levels of accountability and transparency, effective communication, and timely professional decision-making; and<br />&bull; Construction Supervision: To fulfill the role of Employer's representative and Engineer for the FIDIC-based contracts for any design and construction activities under the Water Supply Project and ensure project quality, in full consultation with MCA-Mongolia and as defined by this TOR and associated Contract Agreement.</p>
<p>A winning Consultant will be selected under the Quality and Cost Based Selection ("QCBS") method. The evaluation procedure for this method is described in sections of the RFP in accordance with the MCC Program Procurement Guidelines, which are available on MCC's website (www.mcc.gov/ppg). The evaluation procedure, as described, will include a review and verification of qualifications and past performance, including a reference check, prior to the contract award.</p>
<p>The RFP includes the following Sections:</p>
<p>PART 1 - PROPOSAL AND SELECTION PROCEDURES<br />Section I Instructions to Consultants <br />This section provides information to help potential Consultants prepare their Proposals; it also provides information on the submission, opening, and evaluation of Proposals and on the award of the proposed contract.</p>
<p>Section II Proposal Data Sheet<br />This section includes provisions that are specific to this procurement and that supplement Section I, Instructions to Consultants.</p>
<p>Section III Qualification and Evaluation Criteria<br />This section specifies the qualifications required of the Consultant and the criteria to be used to evaluate the Proposal.</p>
<p>Section IV A Technical Proposal Forms<br />This section provides the Technical Proposal Forms which are to be completed by a potential Consultant and submitted separately as part of a potential Consultant's total Proposal.</p>
<p>Section IV B Financial Proposal Forms<br />This section provides the Financial Proposal Forms which are to be completed by a potential Consultant and submitted separately as part of a potential Consultant's total Proposal.</p>
<p>Section V Terms of Reference<br />This Section includes the detailed Terms of Reference that describe the nature, tasks, and duties of the consulting services to be procured.</p>
<p>PART 2 - CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT AND CONTRACT FORMS<br />Section VI Contract Agreement and General Conditions of Contract<br />This section contains the form of Contract proposed to be entered into between the MCA Entity and Consultant.</p>
<p>Section VII Special Conditions of Contract and Annexes to Contract<br />This section contains the form of those clauses of the Contract that supplement the GCC and that are to be completed by MCA Entities for each procurement of Consulting Services. This section also includes an Annex to the Contract (Annex B: Additional Provisions) that contains provisions that are a part of the Government's and the MCA Entity's obligations under the Compact and related documents which, under the terms of the Compact and related documents, are required to be transferred onto any Consultant, Sub-Consultant or Associate who partakes in any MCC-funded procurement.</p>
<p>Please note that a Pre-Proposal Conference, a site visit and review of files in a Data Room will be held as described in the Proposal Data Sheet ("PDS") in Section II of this RFP.</p>
<p>To register and request the RFP, interested parties should send an e-mail with the subject line "Request for Mongolia PMC &amp; CS RFP", to the Procurement Agent at PA-Mongolia@charleskendall.com, with copy to Procurement Specialist at the National Secretariat at enkhtungalag.togtokh@mca-1.org.
