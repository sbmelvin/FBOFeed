<DESC>The attached synopsis is for Mississippi River Channel Dredging with a Hydraulic Pipeline Dustpan Dredge and Attendant Plant.  The work consists of furnishing, delivering, and operating one fully operated hydraulic pipeline dustpan dredge and attendant plant for the removal and satisfactory disposal of shoal material.  The primary dredging region will be any point on the Mississippi River between Cairo, Illinois (Mile 953.8 AHP) and New Orleans, LA. (Mile 106 AHP).  Dredging may be required at secondary locations between Cubit's Gap (Mile 4.0 AHP) and Southwest Bar Channel (Mile 22.0 BHP); and tributaries of the Mississippi River.  Only one contract will be awarded from this solicitation.  Award will be made on the basis of the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 9, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements, and is judged to represent the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.  The contract will consist of one year to construct or prepare a dredge, one base year, plus three option periods not to exceed 12 months for each period.  Each option will be one year in length. Total length of contract including one year to prepare a dredge will not exceed five (5) years if base and all three options are exercised.  If construction of prepared dredge is completed within one year, upon mutual agreement between the Contractor and the Government, notice to proceed with dredging assignments may be issued within the first 12 months of the contract.  Any work performed during the initial 12 months will be paid for at the applicable contract prices of Base Year (12 Months) of Section 00010.  The base and all options will be added together to form one total price.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options.  The value of the proposed work for the base and all options is Not-To-Exceed (NTE) $48,000,000.00.  No payment will be made for the construction or modification of an existing hydraulic dredge.  This procurement will be an unrestricted solicitation.   For the purpose of this procurement to qualify as a small business concern, in addition to being independently owned and operated and not dominate in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, the concern must have had average annual sales receipts for the preceding three fiscal years not exceeding $20.0 million or other criteria as prescribed by the Small Business Administration.  The supplies or services to be procured under this solicitation are classified in Standard Industrial Classification Code 1629.  To be considered small for small for purpose of Government procurement, a firm must perform at least forty (40) percent of the volume dredged with its own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 with a small business size standard of $20.0 million.  This solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and will be unrestricted with an Evaluation Preference for Hubzone Small Business concerns.  The RFP will be issued on/about 31 Jan 2012.  The documents for this RFP will be posted on Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI).
