<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />A repository of human cells, selected for their possible aid in understanding the process of aging, was established by the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development in 1974. This repository came under the National Institute on Aging (NIA) control in 1976 and has since been expanded to include animal cultures as well as human. The repository has served the aging research community by providing investigators with cultures of high quality, well-characterized and uncontaminated cell lines for studying the biology of aging.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) supports research on the biology of aging and age-related conditions and diseases. The purpose of this acquisition is to continue the operation of the Aging Cell Repository which serves as a resource to facilitate biogerontology research by providing high quality, uncontaminated, well-characterized, cell lines to investigators.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The principal goals the Government hopes to achieve through this contract include: 1) collection of biological specimens from a broad spectrum of species, including humans and non-human primates and other animal species, that exhibit some feature that makes them valuable for biogerontology research; 2) from these biological specimens, prepare cell cultures of high quality, i.e., uncontaminated, well characterized, and clinically documented; 3) generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from cell lines in the cell repository; 4) store the cell cultures under very specialized conditions, i.e., in liquid nitrogen; and 5) remove from storage, expand, and distribute to investigators upon request.</p>
<p>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>Quarterly Progress Reports to include the description of the work performed during the reporting period; and a Final Progress Report to include the status of the aged cell bank at the end of the contract period will be required.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is one 12-month base year with four 12-month option years. The anticipated award date is February 1, 2015.<br /><br />OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS<br /><br />The Government is expected to use procedures in FAR Part 15. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>

A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate, under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, with Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Coriell), Camden, New Jersey for the Development and Maintenance of an Aged Cell Bank requirement. The Government will use procedures in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code will be 541712 (500 employees). This effort will be for a 12-month base period with four 12-month option periods on or about February 1, 2015.</span></strong></span></strong></p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The NIA supports research on the biology of aging and age-related conditions and diseases. The purpose of this requirement is to continue the operation of the Aging Cell Repository which serves as a resource to facilitate biogerontology research by providing high quality, uncontaminated, well-characterized, cell lines to investigators. The importance of this resource lies in the unique collection of cell lines for aging research and the research opportunities they present.</p>
<p>The proposed contractor is the only source that meets the needs of the NIA is that there is significant risk in moving such a large collection of cryopreserved cell lines. Support for a noncompetitive, sole source acquisition is based on the risks inherent in moving the aged cell bank and on the past performance of the current contractor. One of the primary requirements for the NIA aged cell bank is high quality cell lines from diverse animal models and human populations. The current bank has been built up over the past forty years to the point where it has many unique and irreplaceable cell lines. The bank has over 2,600 cell lines, which represents over 114,000 individual vials. These vials are stored at three different sites for safety reasons - cells are stored in 63 different liquid nitrogen tanks at the primary site, 11 liquid nitrogen tanks at the on-site back-up facility, and 117 boxes at the off-site back-up facility. There are also over 2,000 buffy coats from 600 subjects in a centenarian study stored in 12 liquid nitrogen tanks, and over 38,000 vials of DNA stored in 12 freezers. It is essential to maintain the quality of the cell lines, and because cryopreserved cell lines are very sensitive to even slight changes in temperature during storage, moving them carries a real risk. Many of the cell lines are irreplaceable and loss of even a portion of the cell lines would set back the research endeavors of the biology of aging research community. The cost to replace those lines for which replacement is possible would be prohibitive. Since inception, approximately $26,000,000 has been invested in the aged cell bank - in today's dollars, replacement would cost many-fold that amount. And the loss of time and therefore valuable research to try to start over would seriously impact aging research productivity.</p>
<p>Coriell has been the contractor for this resource since its inception in 1974. Coriell is recognized as a leader in the field of cell repository research and service for biomedical research. Coriell has developed new methodologies to enhance the characterization of the cell lines, which increases their value to the research community. The quality control at all stages of the work scope have been the highest possible and Coriell has worked with the Government and the research community to acquire new cell lines of value to the aging research community. <br />In addition, Coriell pioneered many of the techniques used in biomedical research use of cell cultures, and has provided solutions to problems encountered by researchers. Coriell offers a wide variety of service to the Aged Cell Bank that increase the value of the cell lines, including molecular fingerprinting to confirm identity of the cell lines, genomic and chromosomal analysis, isolation of high-quality DNA and microarrays. They are uniquely positioned to keep the NIA Aged Cell Bank on the cutting edge of research technology, and have implemented new technologies in previous contracts that have characterized the cell lines in-depth, aiding the use of these cell lines in research.</p>
<p>Optimal culture conditions are essential to faithfully mirror the biological nature of the cell lines and Coriell is the leader in developing standardized culture conditions based on the needs of each cell line. Millions of dollars of current funded research projects depend on the integrity of the cell lines, and many more millions of dollars of research will build on the findings published from the research using these cell lines. Therefore, it is essential to maintain this cell bank with the leader in the field.</p>
<p>Since this is a sole source requirement, the solicitation will not be made available through the Government Point of Entry (GPE). However, the solicitation can be obtained by sending an electronic request (via email) to Fred Ettehadieh at fred.ettehadieh@nih.gov. In return, the requestor will receive a copy of the solicitation in an adobe format. In addition, a draft Statement of Work is attached for further clarification of the requirements of the Aged Cell Bank. No telephone or facsimile responses will be accepted. All requests must be sent no later than 12:00 P.M. (EST) on August 1, 2014. Otherwise, the Government will not be obligated to respond to requests after the above mentioned due date.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-14-001 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-14-001.</p>

<DESC><p>The development of animal models is a key element in the successful development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical, radiological, and nuclear (CRN) threats, particularly since efficacy of products directed against most of these threats cannot be verified using clinical studies. In 2002, the FDA amended its regulations for drugs and biologics to permit approval or licensure of MCMs based on substantial evidence of effectiveness in animals when adequate and well-controlled efficacy studies in humans cannot be conducted because it would be unethical to expose healthy human volunteers to lethal or disabling toxic CBRN substances. This change in the regulations (21 CFR 314.600 for drugs and 21 CFR 601.90 for biologics), commonly referred to as the "Animal Rule," made the design and conduct of adequate efficacy studies in appropriate animal models of paramount regulatory importance, since the inference of efficacy in humans necessary for drug approval or licensure is based solely on efficacy data derived in animals. Demonstration of the safety of the medical countermeasure (drug or biologic) is done in normal, healthy adult humans and in some cases safety in a related pathology particularly if the drug or biologic is already approved for the related pathology.</p>
<p>The United States Government (USG) seeks appropriate Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) laboratories that are adequate and available to establish new or existing animal tests and/or models for the development of CRN MCMs. In these models, the challenge dose generally should be the same as that which produces the human disease or condition and the pathophysiological mechanism of its toxicity should be reasonably well-understood and mimic the human disease/condition as closely as possible. When these models are used to test the efficacy of potential MCMs for CRN agents, the mechanism of action of the countermeasure will need to establish the utility of the animal model as a surrogate for humans. BARDA anticipates that contracts awarded from this RFP will serve to facilitate the animal model development of medical countermeasures and/or supportive reagents and assays for regulatory acceptance in the U.S.</p>
<p>HHS, through ASPR and BARDA, anticipates multiple awards of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The anticipated period of performance for any resultant contracts will be for a total of up to 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. Offeror's will be required to respond to Sample Request for Task Order Response (RTOR) documents as part of their proposal.</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility</p>
<p>Offerors must meet the following mandatory criterion for eligibility for an award: <br /><br />1. Federal, State, and/or local licenses as required for the operation and control of a clinical level irradiation facility with qualified personnel for the operation, assigned safety restrictions, domestic and instrument calibration per licensed Health Physics authority. (Applies to RadNuc Only)</p>
<p>2. Federal, State, and/or local licenses as required for the storage, use, and disposal of select agents such as chemical agents and radionuclides and training of all associated staff responsible for the use of such material. (Applies to both Chem and RadNuc)</p>
