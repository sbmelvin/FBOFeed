The main responsibilities of the Field Coordinators will include, but not be limited to: (1) Providing timely review, assessment, and recommendation of family reunification requests to the designated FFS; (2) Assisting the FFS in ensuring that children are placed in the least restrictive setting while receiving appropriate services; (3) Conducting regular 	site visits to designated DUCS-contracted care providers; (4) Participating in weekly case staffing meetings with care providers and FFS; (5) Participating in monthly collaborative meetings with local DHS officials, care provider staff, legal service providers, and the designated Federal Field Specialist; (6) Providing targeted child welfare based technical assistance to care provider staff, as directed by DUCS staff; (7) Referring at-risk children for suitability assessments and follow up services, in collaboration with care provider and FFS; and (8) Making placement referrals and recommendations for children who require more specialized levels of care, such as long-term foster care and residential treatment centers, in collaboration with care provider and FFS.

Use of third party software that has not been tested by the Department nor has been proven in concert with Department specific server configurations may result in OS\application conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and ultimately render the "thin" solution inoperable. Citrix offers the deparment an online licensing system with built in tracking. Also, the Citrix ICA protocol, which is the backbone of how thin clients communicate to the Citrix Server "Farm", requires only a small amount of bandwidth (22K) for minimal operations. This allows the deparment more flexibility in where and how thin clients will be deployed. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the softwaremust be a Citrix brand and provided by a Citrix reseller. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed above as a key component of the Deparment's networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of Stat's enterprise network infrastructure use of third party software that has not been tested by the Department nor has been proven in concert with Department specific server configurations may result in OS\application conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and ultimately render the "thing" solution inoperable. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Deparment's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a single source requirement for use of a particular brand, the acquisition for the Lease to Own Purchase of a Canon Image Runner Pro 1770 VP Network Production System, from IKON Office Solutions, Inc, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the sole vendor certified to sell and service the 100 Image Runner systems in the state of Oklahoma.  The Image Runner high-speed duplication system is used to assist in printing FAA purchase orders, training materials, reports and directions. FAA currently has four (4) Canon 110 Image Runner, high capacity stacker, extra paper module and post processor printers.  All equipment must work together with work flowing back and forth between different printers and servers. The FAA conducted a market analysis in May 2002, of products available to meet their requirements.  As a result of the market analysis, IKON was the only vendor proposing equipment with fully open architecture that provided equipment that would interface/connect with the proposed equipment.   The FAA requires a local response time of 1 to 2 hour for service due to the critical nature of many printing requirements.  IKON is the sole vendor certified to sell and service the Canon 110 Image Runner systems in the state of Oklahoma and has the technical staff on board locally to meet response time requirements. The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with IKON Office Solutions, Inc, (IKON) Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in accordance with Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4, Single Source Selection.   This survey supports our determination to solicit and negotiate with only one firm.  This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a request for proposals.

The United States Government intends to award a lease extension, using other than full and open competition to Pathway Ventures, LTD/Crossroads Office Park.  The extension will be for 11,905 rentable square feet of fully serviced space and 35 parking spaces for a term of twelve months.

The Government has a continuing need for this space until such time as a new lease can be awarded.  It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the Government?s intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Andrea Cooney, Realty Specialist, at andrea.cooney@gsa.gov or to her attention at GSA, Property Acquisition & Realty Services Division (4PEC), Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351.  Any written comments are to be received within fourteen (14) days of publication of this notice.

Responses are due by close of business July 13, 2007.

<CONTACT>Loren Frei, Contract Specialist, Phone 206-526-6370, Fax 206-526-6025, Email Loren.Frei@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) on a sole source basis with Digital Angel Corporation in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) only one responsible source, for the development of a replacement FDX-B PIT-tag transceiver that can operate multiple antennas for in-stream applications. The Government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 15. All prospective vendors must have (1) experience designing FDX-B PIT-tag transceivers for fisheries applications, (2) experience designing multiplexing PIT-tag transceivers, and (3) experience designing PIT-tag antennas for stream applications.  The requirements under this contract consist of the following tasks:
 
(1) Develop a document that describes the overall multiplexing transceiver including functional level descriptions of both the master controller and an individual antenna controller node. This document will include a description of all of the features of the multiplexing transceiver system as well as all of the host interfaces.  The deliverable shall be a document describing the system design within one month after a contract is issued.
(2) Development of the Antenna Controller Node - Functional Engineering Prototype:  The contractor will design and develop a ?stand alone? ACN. Each ACN will be able to operate independently and provide a serial output that contains received tag information.  The design will include all aspects of the ACNs:  hardware (both analog and digital), software, communication protocols, and the design criteria for the antennas that will be attached to them.  Each ACN must minimally be able to operate a 20 ft x 4 ft antenna.  The water-tight enclosure for an ACN will also be developed, but not prototyped.  The deliverable will be a functional engineering prototype of a stand-alone CAN without a water-tight enclosure, and will include a functioning 20 ft x 4 ft antenna. The deliverable will be required within five months after award of the contract.
(3) Development of the Master Controller - Functional Engineering Prototype: 
The contractor will design and develop the MC.  During this phase the MC hardware and software will be developed including the communication protocols to the ACNs and to the host.  At this point, the software will include the basic tag-recording function as well as limited reporting and diagnostic capabilities. The deliverable will be a functional engineering prototype of a system with one MC and two ACNs (and their antennas), and will include prototype water-tight enclosures.  This deliverable will be required 6 months after item (2) above has been accomplished.

(4) Final design completion with delivery of a complete system:
The contractor will incorporate additional reporting and diagnostic capabilities to the system.  In addition, the hardware for the ACN or MC will be modified as necessary. The deliverable will be one complete transceiver system that includes one MC and a minimum of six ACNs in their final enclosures.  Furthermore, it will include the full complement of diagnostic capabilities and be delivered with the different types of manuals (e.g., user and maintenance) requested by the fisheries community in the requirements document.  Delivery of the complete system is required within 5 months after item (3) above has been accomplished.

The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract.  The NAICS Code is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All interested concerns must submit documentation in writing demonstrating their capability, expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the necessary work to Loren.Frei@noaa.gov no later than August 13, 2007.         See Numbered Note 22.  

All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered in CCR please access the following web site:http//www.ccr.gov. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dunn & Bradstreet Number.

UMBC will continue the development of a 3-dimensional air quality system and the enhancement of the aerosol remote sensing algorithm.  This task involves transitioning and enhancing Infusing Satellite Data into Environmental Applications (IDEA) to NESDIS/STAR computers for real time applications.  This acquisition for Other Than Full and Open Competition is pursuant to the authority permitted under Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 6.302-1, (1) Citations:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c (1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c), Only one responsible source.

The algorithm development in performing this task requires contractor to:  Adapt current IDEA algorithm based on MODIS AOD, EPA, PM2.5 measurements and a trajectory model to run on NOAA/NESDIS computers; Develop algorithms to improve GOES operational AOD product into IDEA; Test continuity between MODIS and GOES AOD input on the stability of the IDEA analysis; Modify the IDEA algorithm to incorporate the future GOES-R AOD data on a 30 minute basis; and Modify IDEA to incorporate GOES-R ABI proxy AOD data, and simulate 5-minute GOES updates to test the impact of this additional computational load on throughput and storage.

The tasks fall under ORA/SMCD Sensor Physics Branch?s air quality program.  The task requires a research scientist to be physically located at NOAA/NESDIS/SMCD, with experience in remote sensing and knowledge of air quality issues.  Experience in meteorological modeling, FORTRAN, IDL, and UNIX operating system is essential.

<CONTACT>Kathleen Munroe, Contracting Officer, (781) 271-6091, email:  Kathleen.Munroe@hanscom.af.mil; Ann Marie Bastek, Contract Specialist, (781) 271-6938, email:  Ann.Bastek@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>This is a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for the award of a sole source contract to The Boeing Company to develop a transponded multi-band Ka/Ku satellite communications (SATCOM) terminal to be installed onboard the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle and integrated with its Airborne Integrated Communications System (AICS).  The  Electronic Systems Center of Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) intends to contract for FAB-T architecture based hardware, software, and waveforms designated for the Global Hawk, F-22, F-35, and wide-body aircraft using the FAB-T Contract (F19628-02-C-0048) awarded to The Boeing Company, 3370 Miraloma Avenue, Anaheim, CA. under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  In this case, the USAF may deem products and/or services to be available only from the original sources in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized products or services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (see 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B). The Air Force anticipates the issuance of this modification to the FAB-T contract by January 2008 for the development of the SATCOM terminal to include development of both a Ka/Ku multi-band antenna subsystem (reflector, pedestal, and radio frequency (RF) chain) and chassis with internally mounted 3U-sized electronic modules based on the established Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminal (FAB-T) architecture's employed VPX standards.  These internally mounted 3U modules shall act in unison to process and support the transmission/reception of a United States Air Force (USAF) developed asymmetric high data rate  (HDR) transponded Ka SATCOM waveform, Common Data Link (CDL) based Ku SATCOM waveform, the USAF's multi-platform (MP) CDL program, and line-of-sight (LOS) Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant waveforms ported from the US Army's Multi Role Tactical Common Data Link (MR-TCDL).   In order to synchronize with Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) satellite schedules, an Engineering Development Model (EDM) of the complete terminal system shall be ready for installation onto the Global Hawk during the FY11 timeframe.   In conjunction with a future competitively awarded Antenna System, these 3U VPX modules shall also be used as the basis for developing form factor modules to be integrated into F-22 and F-35 communications suites to form a fighter based SATCOM terminal system.  To fulfill "family of terminal" concept objectives, these modules shall employ the FAB-T developed Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) SATCOM waveform code for low probability intercept/low probability detection (LPI/LPD) communications.  To support widebody aircraft (e.g. E-8 & E-3A), a standardized Air Transport Rack (ATR) form-factor chassis populated with these 3U VPX modules shall be developed and employed with either variants of the FAB-T Increment 1 developed Large Aircraft Antenna (LAA) or a TBD competitively awarded antenna system.  As with the Global Hawk and fighters, these ATR-packaged 3U VPX modules shall be  capable of supporting the FAB-T developed AEHF, transponded HDR Ka, CDL-based Ku, and/or Global Broadcast System (GBS) SATCOM waveforms along with ported MR-TCDL and multi-platform (MP) CDL developed LOS waveforms.   Fighter and wide-body EDM capabilities shall be ready for installation in the FY13 timeframe. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should this notice be construed as a commitment.  Any US commercial company who firmly believes that they are capable of meeting the stated Government objectives and timeframes within this NOCA may identify their interest to the Government.  Interested firms are requested to submit a statement of qualifications, along with supporting documentation to:  653 ELSG/KCK, Attn: Ms Kathleen A. Munroe, Contracting Officer in writing or by electronic transmission to:  Kathleen.munroe@hanscom.af.mil or Ms. Ann Marie Bastek, Contract Specialist, ann.bastek@hanscom.af.mil.  Responses must be received no later than 15 calendar days after the date of this publication and should not exceed ten (10) pages on 8 ½ x 11 inch paper with type no smaller than 10 pitch.   An Ombudsman, Col Russell Blaine, Director, Commander's Staff, 781-377-5106, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal and proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the Contracting Officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman should be contacted only with issues or problems that have previously been brought to the attention of the program manager and/or Contracting Officer and could not be satisfactorily resolved at that level.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely  for the purpose determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 26.

<DESC>In support of RAF Alconbury and RAF Upwood, the government intends to award a contract for linen services.  This is a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation. There will be no public bid opening. This is a Request for Proposal (RFP), Performance Price Trade-Off (PPTO) solicitation. Award will be based upon Best Value to the Government in accordance with FAR 15 and the terms in the solicitation. This will be awarded unrestricted. The NAICS code for this requirement is 812320.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package.  The entire solicitation, including the performance work statement, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.   Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 19 September 2006 and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and attachments.  Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation.  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov/ and http://orca.bpn.gov/. Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 an ombudsman had been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.  The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g. agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting (10 MSG/LGCB), United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado, intends to award a Sole Source commercial purchase order in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14, 22 Nov 06.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 811219 and the size standard is $6.5M.

The Government has determined Spectrum Surgical Instruments, Inc. is the only source that can satisfy this agency's requirement. The requirement is for a follow-on contract to continue the services of a comprehensive surgical instrument repair, sharpening and education program which has attributed to documented trends showing a vast improvement in risk management in the surgical unit at the 10th Medical Group Medical Group, USAFA.  One on-site visit will be scheduled to inspect, repair and sharpen an estimated 4000 instruments within the designated time of five business days.  All instruments must be inspected.  Customized educational modules using a digital mapping service will be utilized to develop a comprehensive training program using quality issues documented during the visit and a site-specific training will be conducted during the same week.   The requirement also includes a need for instruments, to include power cords, orthopedic power drills and saws, endoscopic and arthroscopic scopes, to be mailed to the contractor for repair and loaner equipment be available within 24-48 hours when needed.  An extensive list of loaner equipment equal to inventory owned by 10th Med Gp. must be available at no cost to the Government.   

All responsible sources believing they can provide the all-inclusive, necessary service and loaner equipment without causing a regression to the previously unacceptable state of potential risk to patients may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.   This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.     

Any company that feels they may be able to provide a comprehensive program and service that meets the needs of the Government must submit their data (2 pages or less) to support their claim.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

Questions should be addressed to Donna Kichton, Contract Specialist, USAF Academy (719) 333-4143 or via e-mail at donna.kichton@usafa.af.mil.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.

SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

The solicitation cited above can only be obtained accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS). FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies. In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR. The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity. Since October 1, 2003 it is federally mandated that any business wishing to do business with the federal government under a FAR-based contract must be registered in CCR before being awarded a contract. In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually. You may access CCR at www.bpn.gov. Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS. No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites. You may access FedTeDS via https://www.FedTeDS.gov. You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled ?Register with FedTeDS? and then choosing the ?Vendor Registration Form? hyperlink. At a minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: Your company?s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Power Identification Number (MPIN), which you can get from your company?s CCR point of contact, your company?s DUNS number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B number), your telephone number and e-mail address.

Also, beginning January 1, 2005, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), all vendors will be required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information at your convenience via the internet at http://orcap.bpn.gov. Potential offerors should refer to the solicitation package regarding instructions involving the use of ORCA.

Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website for amendments, if any, to the solicitation.

The General Services Administration Central Heating & Refrigeration Plant (GSA CHRP) provides steam and chilled water to over 100 government facilities in the Washington DC area.  The General Service Administration Heating Operation and Transmission District (HOTD) has five (5) high pressure Boilers and one (1) Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) that produces 250 psi of saturated steam at 400? F.  Because the production of steam is GSA HOTD?s sole purpose and main source of revenue, it is imperative to minimize, if not eliminate, down time caused by any failure during the operating season.  Therefore, GSA HOTD needs a contract vehicle that requires a contractor to provide emergency response services that cover all possible failure points in a Boiler.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed prices type contract with Time and Material provisions for services (including labor) for the development of a threat evaluation software system to improve maritime domain awareness in a selected Area of Responsibility (AOR) as required by the Commander Navy Europe/Commander Sixth Fleet, Naples, Italy.  This is a 100% Small Business set aside under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 541511.

The services will include developing and applying a fully compatible and interfaced with maritime detection data inputted from deployed equipment, tools, instruments, or other data sources, and authorized to operate in a military or a coalition network environment (classified or non-classified). The contractor shall provide a computer based threat evaluation system together with any other complementary, associated, supporting or bundled programs that will analyze ocean going cargo vessels for security implications in support of comprehensive maritime domain awareness efforts. The system shall allow for utilization of business rules developed in collaboration with coalition/Alliance partners, be approved by the US Navy and access external data to allow accurate, in depth and reliable threat evaluation and analysis, realistic and practical recommendations for interdiction, boarding or other appropriate action. Features shall include: Automatic data stream to identify and geolocate vessels; allow specification of parameters controlling which vessels to evaluate i.e. (geographic bounds, flag state, vessel type or size etc.); allow for access to external data to discover vessel, crew, cargo and voyage data; allow user developed threat evaluation rules and scoring to be applied to data automatically; shall display an operational picture with indications of threat status for all vessels based on a logical combination of scores derived from the application of each threat evaluation rule; and allow ?drill-down? to display logic behind the threat status for each vessel. EXAMINATION OF SOURCE SELECTION PLAN Offerors are invited to examine the Navy?s Source Selection Plan (SSP), located at <http://www.fedbizops.gov>.  It is not unusual for an SSP to contain some matters not specifically described in the solicitation, and vice versa.  For instance, the SSP will often identify the evaluation weighting scheme in greater detail, and may include the forms used by the Technical Evaluation Board in reviewing proposals. Despite these variations, both documents are intended to operate in harmony.  If any Offeror discovers an actual conflict between the provisions of the SSP and the Solicitation, this matter must be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer before the proposal submission date.  Please keep in mind that a conflict involves provisions that are inconsistent or mutually exclusive, not merely containing more detailed or additional information.  In the event that the SSP and the solicitation are in direct conflict, the provisions of the solicitation will apply, except for those matters referenced in the SSP that may be mandated by law or regulation.  

N.B.: If the Offeror cannot access the SSP from the address provided above, immediately contact the Contracting Officer or the Government?s designated representative identified in. The proposed request for proposals (RFP) N00189-07-R-0032 will be posted on or before 12 July 2007 with a response date of 30 days thereafter. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.   Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that the prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make the offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on behalf of the NESDIS Office of Research and Applications (ORA) intend to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.  This acquisition for Other Than Full and Open Competition is pursuant to the authority permitted under Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 6.302-1, (1) Citations:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c (1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c), Only one responsible source.

The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind speed processing software called the APLINDAA SAR Wind Retrieval System (ANSWRS) was developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) for the NESDIS Alaska SAR Demonstration.  This system is currently providing near-real time high resolution coastal winds to the National Weather Service and other users.  The system has been installed at NESDIS in the Alaska SAR Demonstration at JHU/APL and at other sites. The ANSWRS system was developed based on research and algorithm development done at JHU/APL.  JHU/APL has modified the SAR winds system to handle input of various wind direction models, as well as the calculation of high winds in hurricanes and will now extend the system further to optimize the assimilation of wind directions to combine model wind directions with those derived from the SAR data itself and to improve algorithm performance in hurricanes.  

There are five task involved in the extension and improvement of the APL/NOAA SAR Wind Retrieval System:  Task 1 enhancement of ALOS Wind Retrievals; Task 2 Operational System Critical Design; Task 3 Enhancement of SAR Wind Direction Estimates; Task 4 Integration of Wind Products with Mentor Project; and Task 5 ANSWRS Maintenance.

The level of effort is part time for a Principal Staff physicist for 16 months.  Extensive knowledge is required of the APL/NOAA SAR Wind Retrieval System software and associated web hosting system for wind projects and meteorological analyses.  Computer skills necessary to carry out the work are proficiency in Interactive Data Language, Unix, Linux, and HTM1.  Knowledge of the theory and practical experience in deriving wind measurements from SAR data are required.

<ARCHDATE>08062007
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Andrea Brunsman, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-9699
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation, Clean Air Market Division anticipates conducting a competition under FAR Part 13: Simplified Acquisition Procedures to procure monitoring services for the acquisition of speciated atmospheric mercury data from sites throughout the US.  EPA anticipates awarding up to 10 purchase orders for this work.  Over the past 5 years, a number of states and academic mercury scientists have been measuring speciated atmospheric mercury at sites located throughout the United States and Canada.  While  most measurements are generally based on automated and/or manual methods as described by Landis et al., 2002, the specific protocols by which measurements are taken can vary across sites, and in some instances, are undocumented.  Thus, accurately comparing measurement data across sites is currently  a significant challenge.  Common protocols for mercury sampling and analysis are needed to facilitate the inter comparison of site data over time.  Moreover, a centralized archive for data distribution is needed to enable mercury policy assessments, evaluate and improve mercury deposition models,  and enhance mercury research.  To meet some of the mercury data and information needs, EPA is collaborating with the mercury scientific community, including the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) membership of federal agencies, states, tribes, academic institutions, and other  organizations to establish a new, national, standardized network to monitor mercury in the atmosphere.  The network seeks to measure air concentrations of mercury in its gaseous and particulate forms, event-based mercury wet deposition, and meteorological and land-cover variables needed for  estimating dry deposition fluxes.  The network envisioned will serve many functions: "	facilitate the calculation of wet, dry, and total deposition; "	provide data for evaluating predictive and diagnostic models and for assessing source-receptor relationships; and  "	build a data set for analyzing  spatial and temporal trends. Under this requirement the contractor shall provide mercury monitoring services for the operation of Tekran mercury analyzers (2537A, 1130, 1135) to produce and distribute to EPA datasets of raw and validated atmospheric mercury concentrations in speciated forms:  elemental, reactive gaseous, and particulate; and meteorology data needed for estimating dry deposition.  EPA also requires a quality assurance plan and associated documentation for all aspects of data collection, as required by EPA Order 53601.A2.   The North American Industry Classification  System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620. The anticipated purchase orders shall be fixed price for a period of 12 months with one possible 12 month option period. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be posted on the Internet on or about July 10, 2007. Proposals shall be due approximately  fourteen (14) days after the RFQ issuance date. Please refer to the EPA website for the status regarding this procurement. Telephone requests or inquires will not be taken.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to enter into negotiations with of Dr. Kara Nelson of UC Berkeley.  In response to recommendations made by the NRC, the US EPA is currently seeking methods that can enumerate infectious helminth ova in biosolids that is more sensitive, more rapid, and easier to perform than using a microscope based approach.  The EPA is interested in developing and validating an ITS-1 rDNA qPCR-based detection method to quantitate viable helminth ova in biosolids and wastewater.  Dr. Kara Nelson, of UC Berkeley, has developed a method that has previously demonstrated to accurately quantitate viable larvated Ascaris ova in water in ten days and has the potential to perform similarly in biosolids and wastewater matrices.  The U.S. EPA believes that Dr. Nelson, at UC Berkeley, is the only known source to possess all the materials necessary to perform this method and thus the only laboratory equipped and capable of performing the tasks stated in the contract.  The period of performance is expected to be from the date of award for twelve months.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541710 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 personnel.  No request for quotation is available and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  All interested, responsible, sources that believe they can satisfy this requirement, must respond within 15 days of the date of this announcement.  Interested vendors shall: 1) include information on the proposed services which clearly supports the requirements outlined above and; 2) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government an order will be placed with Dr. Kara Nelson of UC Berkeley.  Response to the U.S. EPA, ATTN: Joel P. Smith, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), RTP-POD, ORD Service Center (Mail Code: E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC  27711 or smith.joel@epa.gov.

<SUBJECT>D -- General maintenance and enhancement of portions of the entire DSAMS system
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-DNAR70126

<CONTACT>Lisa Davis, Contracting Officer, Phone (703) 604-0893, Fax (703) 602-1671, Email Lisa.Davis@dsca.mil - James Washington Jr, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-604-6566, Fax 703-602-1671, Email James.Washington@dsca.mil
<DESC>The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), 201 12th  Street, Arlington VA 22202 intends to solicit for service to support the continued maintenance and enhancement of a very large (~60,000 function points) and complex software application known as the Defense Security Assistance Management System (DSAMS).  DSAMS is managed and maintained by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on behalf of over 2,500 users in the Army, Navy, Air Force, DSCA and other Defense Agencies.  

DSAMS was built in three major development phases, with each subsequent phase adding functionality to a single DSAMS system.  The Case Development Module (CDM) and Case Implementation Module (CIM) were deployed into full production for all three Military Departments (MILDEPs) and Defense Agencies in 1999 and 2000, respectively, and are in a stable maintenance mode.  The Training Module (TM) was deployed into full production for the Army and Navy in October 2006 and is expected to still be in a post-deployment stability phase (e.g., incorporating deferred changes) at the inception of this contract. Development of TM functionality for the Air Force has been partially completed, with full deployment intended at the earliest opportunity (currently targeted for October 2008).  

The primary support required for this contract is to help maintain the portions of DSAMS that have been deployed so far, help complete the TM portion for the Air Force to allow a successful deployment at the earliest opportunity, and help maintain the complete system thereafter.  Deployment means that DSAMS is now used to support the business function  and the legacy system is no longer used for that purpose.  DSAMS has already replaced five legacy systems completely and parts of others. 

DSCA plans to issue a performance-based Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract.  This requirement will be solicitated as a total 8(a) set aside, no exceptions.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541519 with a size standard of  $23 Million.  The period of performance will consist of a based period of 12 months from date of award and (4) four option periods consisting of 12 months each. The solicitation will be made available on the DSCA website on or about 23 Jul 2007. The DSCA web address for downloading the solicitation is as follows: http://www.dsca.mil/programs/biz-ops/business_operations.htm.  A link to this website will also be posted on Fed Biz Opps.  Fed Biz Opps can be accessed by the following web address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  NO PAPER COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED.  NO TELEPHONE/FAX REQUESTS WILL BE HONORED.  Once the solicitaion is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review both web sites frequently for any updates/amendments to any documents.  Instructions will be provided in the solicitation on how and when to submit questions regarding the requirement.  All prospective offerors must have a Commercial and Government Entity Code (CAGE Code) and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as prescribed in DFARS 252.204-7004, in order to be considered for award.  Offerors may register at the following website: http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Detention and Removal Operations (DRO), intends to pursue a sole source logical follow-on contract with FLYTECOMM, 1043 North Shoreline Blvd, Suite 201, Mountain View, CA 94043.   

DRO has a requirement for real-time situational awareness capabilities to facilitate surface tracking (i.e. motor vehicles) and the status of DRO of detention and removal operations facilities (e.g. number of detainees and available bed space).  This Surface and Facilities Tracking System is intended to supplement and extend the current aviation centric real-time law enforcement situational awareness capabilities that are delivered to the agency via the FLYTECOMM Travel Advisory System (TAS).  The proposed enhancements must be capable of full integration with TAS.    

The fully integrated system enhancements must also be accessible via the public network to facilitate DRO law enforcement operations.  To that end, the system platform must have an established track record of portable, yet secure access with an execution history that has been reviewed by accredited third parties to meet or exceed published information assurance and security standards set forth by NIST.  FLYTECOMM?s TAS meets these requirements.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a purchase order on a sole source non-competitive basis to Dr. Michael Pecht, 7027 Hunter Lane, Hyattsville, Maryland.  Dr. Pecht shall inform and advise FDA on how to develop regulatory scope for medical device hardware and software reliability and maintenance.  The FDA regulates medical devices which contain software.  These devices, their behaviors, their risk mitigations and their engineering controls are best described as very complex systems.  The medical device software provides instructions to the overall medical device system which determine its behavior when presented with all reasonably foreseeable external stimulus.  In order to determine what the effect upon safety and effectiveness might be of the software, it is necessary to examine the way in which the device moves from state to state.  For even moderate complexity systems this state transition study can be lengthy.  Software reliability is the term used in the software development community to describe mathematically rigorous analysis techniques used to prove assertions of software reliability, safety and repeatability.  Dr. Pecht shall assist FDA in developing a guidance document on medical device software reliability of the complex safety and effectiveness attributes so necessary to protect the public Health.  Dr. Pecht has the expertise necessary for this requirement.  He has consulted for over 50 major international electronics companies, providing expertise in strategic planning, design, test, IP and risk assessment of electronic products and system.  FDA anticipates a one year period of performance.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.   However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a purchase order on a sole source non-competitive basis to HyClone, 925 West 1800 South, Logan, Utah 84321.  The FDA will purchase fetal bovine sera from HyClone.  The grade of fetal bovine sera designated as ?defined,? manufactured only by the HyClone subdivision of Thermo Fisher Scientific, is critical for success of many of FDA?s research efforts.  HyClone ?defined? serum is strictly necessary to maintain continuity with ongoing experiments and assays being developed by FDA scientists.  This source is necessary because of the large volume of work with primary, non-transformed mouse lymphocytes, which do not function and die without sera of this quality in the growth media.  This supply of sera was originally chosen because it is the only source on the market in the U.S. to meet the following specifications, all of which are essential for our research purposes: endotoxin (per limulus amoebocyte lysate - gel clot), <10 EU/mL; hemoglobin (spectophotometric), <10 mg/dl; complete sterility testing per current USP and EP; filtration through serial 40 nm (0.04 ?m) pore-size rated filters, resulting in over 8 logs of viral load reduction, as demonstrated by complete virus testing (per 9 CFR 113.53) with all major bovine viral adventitious agents (bluetongue, bovine adenovirus, bovine parvovirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, rabies, reovirus, cytopathogenic agents, and hemadsorbing agents) determined to be negative; and exhaustive biochemical characterization (including assessment of progesterone, isulin, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, gamma globulin, phospholipids, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT], thiamine [B1], riboflavin [B2], pyridoxine [B6], nicotinic acid [niacin], vitamin H [biotin], vitamin A [retinol], carotene, total vitamin E [tocopherol], cyanocobalamine [B12], pteroylglutamic acid [folate], vitamin C, 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D, pH, total protein, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, inorganic phosphorus, osmolality, iron, selenium, IgG, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, magnesium, glucose, copper, total iron binding capacity [TIBC], and percent saturation).

<DESC>The Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) serves as the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) legal advisor and represents the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE before various courts, boards, and tribunals.  

OPLA is an integral part of ICE's operations with respect to both its immigration services and its enforcement components. 
OPLA has determined that its operational success depends, in part, on expansion of its current document management capabilities.  The federal courts and immigration courts are both rapidly moving into paperless environments.  OPLA needs to do the same in order to function in these environments.  

OPLA requires an expanded capability to manage its enormous document repository by leveraging existing technology and expanding the document management capabilities of the its General Counsel Electronic Management System [GEMS] case load application.  A key management tool within the existing application is Interwoven iManage WorkSiteNT. ICE intends to acquire an Interwoven iManage WorkSite NT Enterprise License for an additional 14,950 users.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent by the Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronic Program Office (PMA-209) to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0024 with Rockwell Collins Government Systems (RCGS), 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA  52498.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is assigned responsibility for the planning, programming, budgeting, procurement, installation, operation, and support of the Air Combat Electronics programs.  This effort covers the requirements to provide Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209).  The A-10 lacks a robust Line-of-Sight (LOS) secure communications system to fully  integrate with composite combat forces.  An ability to reprogram voice communications in flight provides reliable means of disseminating real-time updates with isolated forces and Command and Control (C2) assets.  Current operations in mountainous and other inhospitable environments are under increasing risk of compromise requiring reduced response times during unconventional air support missions, reduced logistical challenges with sustainment of current equipment and improved interoperable connectivity with communications equipment fielded and used by forces being employed both on the ground and airborne.  The net effect of a secure robust LOS communications capability will be a highly reliable, responsive Close Air Support and Combat Search and Rescue, with lower maintenance enjoyed by materiel improvement.  This effort further defines and modifies the approved T-1 Documentation and recommended changes to the previously defined A and B Kits.  As Rockwell Collins is the sole developer of the ARC-210 Family of products and related ancillary equipment and maintain the proprietary rights to this radio, they are the only capable source of providing the requested changes.  Effort will be performed within 6 months ARO.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.

<SUBJECT>70--RFI - Additional Gateway Funcationality
<SOLNBR>VA-200-07-RI-0034
<ARCHDATE>07132007
<CONTACT>Kari Cozzens Contract Specialist 512-326-6494
<DESC>Request for Information VA-200-07-RI-0034 The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Network and Security Operations Center, Falling Waters WV., is requesting information for a capability to perform various tasks relating to HTTP, HTTPS, FTP over HTTP, native FTP, IM and P2P protocols.  The VA has a requirement to evaluate the content of all protocols passing through its gateways from the intranet to the Internet to ensure that data leaving the VA's intranet complies with the VA's data exchange policies for: VA Protected Information (VAPI); information protected by the security and privacy provisions of the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); and the VA's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for the Internet.  The objective of this request is to identify an appliance or appliances that are capable of performing a set of general functions as outlined in section 2.1 and will provide the additional specific functionality: &quot;	HTTP / HTTPS User Authentication Functionality (see section 2.2 below) &quot;	Antivirus / Anti-Malware Scanning Functionality (see section 2.3 below) &quot;	HTTP, HTTPS and FTP Content Evaluation Functionality (see section 2.4 below) &quot;	Detailed Usage Log Functionality (see section 2.5 below) &quot;	URL Filtering Functionality (see section 2.6 below) &quot;	IM and P2P Filtering Functionality (see section 2.7 below) 1.0	Architecture Background The VA infrastructure consists of four national gateways that process outbound and inbound Internet traffic.  Traffic from internal VA users destined for Internet resources travels through the VA internal network to one of the national gateways.  Each national gateway is built to have identical capabilities and consists of appliances from multiple vendors which provide existing capabilities.  The national gateways utilize routing and content switching to direct traffic through the gateways.  The VA has a requirement to positively identify internal VA users who utilize the national gateways for Internet resources and ensure all traffic adheres to VA Internet usage policies.  The additional functionality the VA seeks must be hosted on appliances that effectively interoperate with existing gateway components; must be manageable by existing gateway management systems; must be capable of lights out operation; and must be able to scale to the VA's throughput and performance requirements. 2.0	Added Functionality 2.1	General Only appliances will be considered.  Server based applications will not be considered during this RFI process due to the maintenance support overhead and workload associated with maintaining server based applications.   Please do not submit an appliance for consideration if the appliance is unable to satisfy those requirements identified as &quot;MUST support . . .&quot; or &quot;MUST be capable of . . .&quot; or &quot;MUST have ability to . . .&quot; and so forth as listed here in this general requirements paragraph AND as listed in the functionality specific requirements paragraph found in the remainder of section 2. Please specifically identify by RFI paragraph number the functionality your appliance is able to support.   The following general requirements have been identified as either mandatory or desirable: &quot;	If solution provides remote command line access it MUST support SSH Version 2. &quot;	Solutions that access websites via HTTP MUST be capable of caching data to optimize bandwidth utilization. &quot;	All appliances MUST support remote upgrade, restore, and downgrade functionality without physical access to the appliance being required. &quot;	Selected vendor MUST be willing to establish a FIPS 140-2 compliant secure access from their Tier 2/3 engineering support group to the VA Gateway if remote support is required by such vendor.&quot;  Actual access to the vendor's device will be controlled by the VA through the use of ACLs. &quot;	Solution should support 2-factor authentication in those cases where authentication with the appliance is required. &quot;	Solution should be able to log configuration changes and positively identify by their VA Active Directory credentials the user making the change, timestamp and specific details on the configuration change made. &quot;	Solution should have the ability to require the use of FIPS 140-2 TLS protocol for all HTTPS sessions &quot;	Solution should support RADIUS or TACACS for management authentication and authorization  &quot;	Solution should have a dedicated Ethernet port to be used for device management traffic &quot;	Solution should have copper Gigabit Ethernet ports used for production traffic &quot;	Solution should either have a serial console compatible with standard asynchronous terminal servers or be compatible with remote KVM access and be equipped with lights out management &quot;	Solution should currently support IPv6 or have a documented roadmap to IPv6 with full support by June 2008 without requiring hardware upgrades or hardware changes &quot;	Solution should be able to support SNMP Version 2 although support for SNMP Version 3 is preferred &quot;	Solution should support transparent proxy via WCCP or content switching &quot;	Solution should provide automated alerts for hardware, system, and application levels such as syslog, SNMP traps or email notification &quot;	Solution should allow downgrades to previous releases &quot;	Solution should allow configuration backup and restore options &quot;	Solution should be based on a hardened appliance &quot;	Solution should provide a centralized configuration management capability such that configuration changes only need to be made to one appliance or on a central management console and those changes are then replicated to the other like devices in the gateways. &quot;	There should be a way to verify that configuration changes have been successful replication to the other like devices in the gateways. &quot;	Any software upgrade, restore, or downgrade should not require physical access to the device in question.  All appliances MUST support remote upgrade, restore, and downgrade. 2.2	HTTP / HTTPS User Authentication Functionality Content filtering web proxy appliances in the gateway are configured to enforce the VA's AUP.  The devices currently record the IP address of the user along with access information in a format similar to a Squid log.  There are, however, a number of devices throughout the VA network that perform network address translation (NAT) on the source IP address obscuring the original source of Internet traffic.  Additionally shared workstations and the use of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) further complicate positive identification of users.  The VA has a requirement to positively identify the VA Active Directory credentials not simply the source IP address, of individuals accessing the Internet and positively linking a user to logged access attempts.  The solution must be able to record this information for use in investigations and disciplinary action where necessary.   In addition to satisfying the general requirements identified in paragraph 2.1 above, the solution submitted in support of the HTTP / HTTPS User Authentication Functionality requirement the following functionality specific requirements have been identified as either mandatory or desirable: &quot;	Solution MUST positively identify the VA Active Directory credentials, not simply the source IP address, of individuals accessing the internet and positively link user to logged access attempts.  &quot;	Solution MUST create audit entries documenting specific user activity of sufficient detail to allow for positive identification of user activity in an investigation. &quot;	Solution MUST not require end-user browser configuration to support this requirement. &quot;	Solution should not require the installation of a client on the end-user system to support this requirement. &quot;	Solution should be configurable to permit access to predetermined URLs without positive identification. &quot;	Solution should not require the user to re-entering their credentials every time a site is accessed. &quot;	Solution should support secure web form authentication. &quot;	Solution should support accurate user authentication while in transparent proxy mode. &quot;	Solution should support monitoring and active modes. &quot;	Solution should support IP spoofing. &quot;	Solution should support use of the HTTP X-forwarding header. &quot;	Solution should support on-box URL filtering as well as caching. 2.3	Antivirus / Anti-Malware Scanning Functionality The VA national gateways currently provide antivirus scanning for SMTP traffic and limited scanning for HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP traffic.  The VA has a requirement to scan all HTTP, HTTPS, FTP over HTTP and native FTP protocols in order to identify, thwart and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious software passing through the gateway.   In addition to satisfying the general requirements identified in paragraph 2.1 above, solution submitted in support of the HTTP / HTTPS User Authentication Functionality requirement the following functionality specific requirements have been identified as either mandatory or desirable: &quot;	Solution MUST have the ability to identify and filter malicious code transmitted over the HTTP protocol.  This includes all HTTP traffic using non-standard ports and TCP port 80. &quot;	Solution MUST have the ability to identify and filter malicious code transmitted over the HTTPS protocol.  This includes all HTTPS traffic using non-standard ports and TCP port 443. &quot;	Solution MUST have the ability to identify and filter malicious code transmitted over the FTP protocol.  This includes all FTP traffic using non-standard ports and TCP ports 20 and 21. &quot;	Solution should provide centralized configuration management, system monitoring and reporting of all devices. &quot;	Solution should support monitoring and active modes &quot;	Solution should support IP spoofing &quot;	Solution should support use of the HTTP X-forwarding header &quot;	Solution should have ability to distinguish and block any IM or P2P traffic transmitted over ports 80 and 443 &quot;	Solution should support on-box URL filtering as well as caching. &quot;	Solution should be able to scan 2,500 to 5,000 connections per second per appliance 2.4	HTTP, HTTPS and FTP Content Evaluation Functionality Currently the gateways provide content filtering for HTTP traffic.  HTTPS and FTP traffic pass through the gateway without content filtering.  The VA has a requirement to evaluate the content of HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP traffic to ensure that data content complies with the VA data exchange policy regarding the protection of VAPI and enforcement of the VA's AUP for the Internet as defined by VA Directive 6001, Limited Personal Use of Government Office Equipment Including Information Technology.   In addition to satisfying the general requirements identified in paragraph 2.1 above, solution submitted in support of the HTTP, HTTPS and FTP Content Evaluation Functionality requirement the following functionality specific requirements have been identified as either mandatory or desirable: &quot;	Solution MUST have ability to identify and block VAPI transmitted in clear text (unencrypted) over the HTTP protocol.  This includes all HTTP traffic using non-standard ports and TCP port 80. &quot;	Solution MUST have ability to identify and block VAPI transmitted over the HTTPS protocol.  This includes all HTTPS traffic using non-standard ports and TCP port 443. &quot;	Solution should have ability to identify and block VAPI transmitted in clear text over the FTP protocol.  This includes all FTP traffic using non-standard ports and TCP port 20/21. &quot;	Solution should be configurable to ignore content filtering of HTTPS traffic being passed to URLs of valid financial institutions. &quot;	Solution should have ability to identify and act upon non-RFC compliant HTTP and HTTPS traffic tunneled over ports 80 and 443 &quot;	Solution should provide centralized configuration management and system monitoring of all devices. &quot;	Solution should support monitoring and active modes &quot;	Solution should be able to scan 2,500 to 5,000 connections per second per appliance 2.5	Detailed Usage Log Functionality Devices in the gateway currently log information to a syslog server. That information is available to the VA for audit review and forensic purposes.  The VA has a requirement to collect user access and activity information from the devices in the gateway, consolidate that information, and download the information to a central location to allow the generation of VA defined detailed reports and ad hoc inquires and reports.   In addition to satisfying the general requirements identified in paragraph 2.1 above, appliances submitted in support of the Detailed Usage Log Functionality requirement the following functionality specific requirements have been identified as mandatory: &quot;	Solution MUST be able to identify authenticated VA Active Directory credentials, timestamps, source IP address, protocol and method (HTTP GET, HTTPS CONNECT) and should provide duration of connectivity.  &quot;	Solution MUST have ability to provide multiple levels of administrative access. &quot;	Solution MUST support centralized customized reporting capabilities. 2.6	URL Filtering Functionality The VA has a requirement for URL filtering. In addition to satisfying the general requirements identified in paragraph 2.1 above, appliances submitted in support of the URL Filtering Functionality requirement the following functionality specific requirements have been identified as either mandatory or desirable: &quot;	Solution MUST be capable of blocking HTTP, HTTPS or FTP traffic, as appropriate, and provide URL filtering capabilities based on VA content policies &quot;	Solution MUST have ability to distinguish and block any IM or P2P sessions transmitted over ports 80 and 443 &quot;	Solution MUST support categorization filtering &quot;	Solution MUST support configurable white list and black list filtering &quot;	Solution should support monitoring-only (transparent) and active modes &quot;	Solution should selectively provide rate limiting functionality based on URL and other criteria. &quot;	It is desirable that the solution be capable of scanning other protocols beyond HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP &quot;	It is desirable that the solution will be able to distinguish and block any IM or P2P sessions transmitted over other ports and protocols. 2.7	IM and P2P Filtering Functionality The VA has a requirement to filter IM and P2P traffic. In addition to satisfying the general requirements identified in paragraph 2.1 above, appliances submitted in support of the IM and P2P Filtering Functionality requirement the following functionality specific requirements have been identified as either mandatory or desirable: &quot;	Solution MUST have ability to distinguish and block any IM or P2P sessions transmitted over ports 80 and 443 &quot;	Solution should support monitoring and active modes &quot;	It is desirable that the solution will be able to distinguish and block any IM or P2P sessions transmitted over other ports and protocols. 3.0	Contact Information for this RFI Interested parties shall submit a capability statement for a decision support solution, company name, point of contact, address, DUNS number, and a brief company background.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NOTES: The solicitation, specifications and drawings will be available on the World Wide Web on or about 18 July 2007, at  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. PRESOLICITATION NOTICE for FA8601-07-R-0045, Project Number ZHTV 050033B,  Repair 2nd Floor Fire Suppression/HVAC-Phase II ABW HQ , Facility 30010,  Area C,  WPAFB.  Period of Performance is 365 days. The overall estimated  price range is between $ 1M and $ 5M. The solicitation is an unrestricted  acquisition, full-and-open competition. In accordance with DFARS  252.204-704 “Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR),” Contractor  must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished  at http://www.ccr2000.com/index.cfm, or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax:  1-703-696-0213. SCOPE OF WORK:  This project renovates the interior and installs fire  suppression that doesn’t currently exist.  It includes complete  replacement of the HVAC and electrical systems.  The fire alarm is so  outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The requirement  for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The renovation will  correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room with inadequate  egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient  use of space. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors. NOTES: 1. The solicitation, specifications and drawings will be available  on the World Wide Web on or about 22 June 2007, at  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. 2.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. a. The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted in  response to RFQ N00178-07-Q-3024 issued on 19 June 2007 and to extend the closing date.  b. The quotation closing date has been extended to 5 July 07. c. The questions and answers are identified as follows:   (1)  QUESTION:   Can the response to the subject Solicitation be submitted via email?  ANSWER: YES. (2) QUESTION:Can the wind velocity requirement for the fully extended 100’+ elevated tower in the self-supporting configuration as specified in Item 8 of the Solicitation be reduced from 80 mph to 50 mph given the buyer’s intended loading? No wind reduction in the guyed configuration or during the raising/lower process is requested.  ANSWER: 80 mph wind speed requirement can be lowered to 50 mph. Technical reasoning is supported by no increase in chance (of 1%) of experiencing 50 vs. 80 mph gusts at locations for use of equipment. (3)QUESTION: As a Buyer cost savings suggestion, would a “painted” trailer sub-structure and perimeter framing with galvanized diamond plate decking be considered as opposed to an all “galvanized” trailer structure? ANSWER: Previous tower purchases of painted frames have significantly rusted through paint when exposed to shore-based marine applications. Trailer sub-structure and perimeter framing along with tower sections, etc. are required to be galvanized. Word format to DLGR_NSWC_XDS13@navy.mil, or via FAX (540)653-6810, Attn:  XDS13-5.  Reference RFQ Number N00178-07-Q-3024 on all correspondence.

These installations include but are not limited to: Naval Station Pearl Harbor (includes Pacific Command; Commander, Pacific Fleet; Commander, Navy Region Hawaii; Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet; Fleet Industrial Supply Center, Pearl Harbor; Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Pacific; Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility; Naval Security Group Department, Kunia; Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility; Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command Activity Pacific; Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific and Hawaii; and Navy Exchange); Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai; 15th Air Lift Wing, Hickam AFB; Schofield Barracks; Fort Shafter; and Marine Corps Base Hawaii (includes MCBH Kaneohe Bay; and Camp Smith).  To register for the Industry Forum, please visit the website at:  https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/navfacpac. 

In 2004, the combined military branches in Hawaii controlled 236,303 acres.  On the island of Oahu, the military controls 85,718 acres.  Collectively in calendar year 2006, the military consumed 1,198,800 MWhrs with a consolidated electric bill of $187 Million.
Specifically, the DoD desires to acquire power generated from conventional and alternative fuel sources, and renewable energy sources as defined in Executive Order 13423 ((renewable energy) means energy produced by solar, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean (including tidal, wave, current and thermal), geothermal, municipal solid waste, or new hydroelectric generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project).  Energy displacement projects, such as solar water heaters that displace heating energy, are not part of this scope, unless innovatively combined with another generating technology.  The current requirement is for all generation to be produced on the military installation.  It is the desire of the DoD that the generation plants will be developed, constructed, owned, operated and maintained by a non-federal government entity or entities.
The desire of the DoD is to purchase power without any direct interest in the ownership or responsibility for the operation or maintenance of the generation assets.  The DoD may consider several procurement authorities and contract formats to accommodate this acquisition; for example, a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), a Public Private Venture (PPV), and/or an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL).  The DoD may consider other alternatives if deemed beneficial to the government.
Specific sites for potential distributed generation plants will be shared at the Industry Forum.
Finally, it is the DoDs intent to purchase power at a rate which is lower than what is currently being purchased for the base. Currently the electricity rate for DoD installations ranges from $0.14/kWh (installations on the island of Oahu) to $0.30/kWh (installations on the island of Kauai).
Specifically, the DoD is currently interested in identifying risks and advantages associated with awarding a contract(s) for the procurement of power, including, but not limited to; awarding a contract within a timeframe where current Federal and State Tax Credits can be applied. Unless extended by Congress, the current deadline for receiving the Federal Renewable Tax Credit is December 2008. Perceived risks are supply of material, construction timelines, Renewable Energy Credit (REC) sales and pricing, and capital financing availability.  Responses to this RFI should address these and other issues that the responder feels should be brought to the attention of the DoD.
The DoD would also like to ascertain whether the sale of power to other parties other than the DoD is either desirable and/or feasible.  In that regard, responses should address specifically what capacity or size of generation asset would be envisioned, and what acreage of land would be developed.  Furthermore, the DoD requests information in regards to an alternate arrangement for a PPA where a site for the distributed generation system would be unspecified. Responses should include considerations of site and location, limitations of site and location, market demand for power, power transmission and distribution costs, and any other pertinent information the responder deems should be brought to the attention of the DoD.  The DoD plans to provide site specific information, including capacity or size of generation asset required and acreage of land available, at the Industry Forum.
The DoD requests that interested parties submit a Statement of Interest and as a minimum provide the following information: (1) Name and location of company, type of business; (2) capability and relevant experience; (3) financial capacity to develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a distributed generation system of desired magnitude; and (4) points of contact.  It is the Governments intent with this RFI to receive Industrys Input as stated in the Statement of Interest Questionnaire.  Marketing brochures or elaborate descriptions of the company are neither necessary nor desired.
The Forum concept is to focus on the acquisition of Distributed Generation for DoD installations in the State of Hawaii.  The intent of the Forum is to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regards to soliciting proposals for Distributed Generation (DG) for various military installations in the State of Hawaii.
All information submitted will be considered proprietary and for official government use only.  Interested parties are encouraged to mark their submissions accordingly.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL (RFP), AND A CONTRACT AWARD WILL NOT BE MADE DIRECTLY FROM THE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF INTEREST. HOWEVER, INFORMATION COMPILED WILL BE REVIEWED AND CONSIDERED JOINTLY BY DOD IN THE FORMULATION OF A STATE-WIDE ACQUISITION STRATEGY AND POTENTIALLY A FUTURE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS WHICH ADDRESS DODs LOCAL INTEREST IN DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND UTILIZATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. The Statement of Interest is due thirty (30) days after this posting date. The maximum length of the Statement of Interest is seven (7) pages.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO), Falls Church, VA, is conducting market research to identify other (non-DoD) Federal agencies, private sector sources (industry), and academia that can provide assistance to DISA in acquiring information technology (IT) capabilities supporting command and control functions and operating in a services-based (services oriented architecture (SOA)) environment, in new and agile ways.  DISA already has numerous processes to identify and obtain such capabilities and services from DoD organizations and traditional DoD industrial partners.  DISA is looking for innovative suggestions to acquire similar services from non-traditional sources and intends to employ a capability broker, as described later in this RFI, to assist and advise the JPMO and Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO). Recognizing that desired capabilities are continually emerging, NECCs market research efforts are expected to continue throughout the life of the program.  The insights gained from this market research will support efforts to reduce program risk, maintain schedules, and control acquisition costs while gaining access to new and more effective technologies. 

The NECC program works particularly closely with DISAs Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program since the programs technologies and architectures are closely associated. Additional general  information regarding the NECC program can be found at the following web site: http://www.disa.mil/necc/overview.html. Additional general information regarding the NCES program can be found at the following web site: http://www.disa.mil/nces/. 

Many capabilities, services, and technologies, both those that respond directly to warfighter needs and those that do so indirectly through improved infrastructure operations, will not originate within the Defense Information Systems Agency. Academia, non-DoD related private sector commercial organizations (including those that are consumer-focused), the Federal civilian agencies, the national laboratories, and other communities are actively doing work of potential value to the NECC program. The NECC program is creating a construct to learn about such work, determine which functionalities could become Capability Modules (CMs), and implement the way-ahead with potential provider organizations. CMs are defined as are small, loosely coupled, militarily useful services (pieces of software) resident on the Global Information Grid (GIG) that can be coupled or mashed to suit a particular mission, place, and time.

The NECC program will solicit best practices, lessons learned, ideas, and requirements and specifications through a variety of information sharing activities. To date, NECC has held broad outreach events and numerous one-on-one exchanges with companies and organizations.  NECC intends to continue this information exchange between the Government and other sources.  DISA still needs private and public sector assistance in finding and delivering capabilities and services to meet DoDs requirement using an agile  procurement process that will occur on a smaller scale than in the past. 

One particular aspect of the NECC program will be the employment of a third party capability broker.   Once DISAs NECC program defines capability architecture, NECC will use the capability broker to identify and nominate specific technologies and capabilities from the public sector outside DoD, the private sector, or other organizations/activities. NECC may acquire some computing capabilities as a managed service or buy easy-to-implement commercial solutions, and subdivide large projects into smaller components that can be combined using service-oriented architecture (SOA) specifications and standards. 

The capability broker is an individual or small team of personnel who will continuously review the market for technological opportunities to meet capability needs of NECC. The broker may be, for example, a small or large business, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center, or an academic organization. Prospective brokers shall identify any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, as described in FAR Part 2 and FAR Subpart 9.5, when responding to this Request For Information (RFI).  For additional information, see DARS Clause 52.209-9000, Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest (OCCI) (December 2005), which is likely to be in any resulting solicitation and contract. DISA comes to the table with technically capable engineers and acquisition experts to contribute to the process. A new approach is to include commercial companies which have led in using emerging technical solutions and processes, to assist DoD in applying commercial best practices to result in a higher success rate for IT initiatives.

The Defense Information Systems Agency is requesting information from appropriate companies or other parties interested in the NECC capability broker strategy. DISA is particularly interested in innovative and creative ideas for: identifying SOA-enabled software services or capabilities components of potential military C2 utility; for engaging with originators of such components; for acquiring components in a developmental, test, or operational state at little or no incremental cost to the Government; for techniques for configuration management and control, and performance management, of third-party software in a distributed, web-enabled environment, etc. 

NECCs requirements for speed, agility and adaptability prohibit proprietary solutions or tightly coupled systems. NECCs preference is for a loose SOA framework to link modules that NECC can add and subtract from at will. Previously, the Government acquired monolithic systems using proprietary technologies. The pace of technological change and the evolving nature of how the military uses IT, combined with tightened budgets and the urgency of the war effort, require a new approach. 

The Defense Information Systems Agency is requesting white papers that include (1) a cover page identifying the company or party CAGE code (if a CAGE code is applicable), street address, proposed NAICS code and size standard, and the names and telephone numbers of the technical point of contact and the overall point of contract for the company or party (in the case of a partnership, please provide the appropriate CAGE code and POC information for the lead company), (2) a summary statement of the companys or partys experience/capabilities, and (3) a discussion of related company or party experience in the areas described above. The white paper should be prepared in Microsoft Word format and is limited to fifteen (15) pages. Submissions are required within thirty (30) days of this announcement and may be made by e-mail or mailing your response to: Ms. Lynne Houde, DISA PEO-C2C, PO Box 4502, Arlington, VA 22204 or 
Email:LYNNE.HOUDE@DISA.MIL.

The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. No solicitation documents exist at this time. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this advertisement. This is a request for information/market research announcement for planning purposes only. The Government will not reimburse costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request. Although proposal terminology may be used in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the Government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.

This notice is part of Government market research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the art of the possible from industry, other Department of Defense organizations, other Federal agencies, industry, and academia. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for the NECC program. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company or industry proprietary information contained in responses should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that publicly releasable and proprietary information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one source to establish the capability and requirements for any future acquisition, so as to inadvertently restrict competition.

<DESC>Requirements:
1)	Easily relocatable structures, either intact or through quick/non-labor intensive disassembly.
a.	Used for aircraft maintenance structures, where the aircraft arrangement on the ramp changes to optimize operations and parking to accommodate new missions.
b.	Used as vehicle maintenance facilities where our vehicle motor pools are consolidating, yet will most likely move again as we expand our land and footprint.
2)	Ability to reconfigure to allow flexibility for future utilization
a.	Used as multipurpose facilities to support current functions that are slated to relocate as we execute our master plan
b.	Storage warehouses that can grow and shrink as our base population grows and shrinks
3)	Compact storage (nesting or folding of components).
4)	Minimum 17? sidewall height to allow full width capability to construct two-story mezzanine/storage/admin space.
a.	Internal structures will be self supporting and not attached or part of the requested structure/shell.
b.	Due to land constraints, we must utilize multi-story (2) administrative facilities, or have the ability to construct a mezzanine office in a high bay warehouse or maintenance facility.
5)	Vertical sidewalls, or near vertical (w/in 1 ft) to provide fully usable space
a.	More efficient for second story for story and high bay warehouse.
6)	Width of 40-60 ft, with variable lengths.  We intend to standardize to allow future ?mix and match? of components for future requirements
a.	Length and width of aircraft, components, and vehicles dictates a minimum 40 ft width.  Add space for material handling equipment (i.e. forklift operations) and anything smaller than 40 ft isn?t feasible or efficient use of our limited space. 
7)	Insulated, or easily to insulate using common industry materials and manual application
a.	Power usage is becoming critical on BAF.  We experience hot summers and cold winters and rely on electric heat and cooling.  We are unable to control the climate of our large open bay maintenance facilities due to the enormous power necessary to heat or cool these un-insulated spaces.  The fabric sides make it difficult and ineffective to attempt to insulate. 
8)	Wind and snow loads of: 20 PSF and 33 PSF respectively
a.	We get lots of wind, and a little bit of snow with some ice.
9)	Metal siding and roofing (no fabric structures)
a.	Provides a better environment and is more durable.

<DESC>DOE is seeking Expressions of Interest related to the digitization of legacy technical R&D reports of DOE and its predecessor agencies. THIS IS AN EXPRESSIONS INTEREST NO PROPOSALS ARE ALLOWED. Submission of a response to this request is not a pre-requisite for an interested party to participate in a follow-on solicitation should DOE, in its sole discretion, elect to issue such solicitation. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI), is seeking Expressions of Interest (EOI) from qualified sources (including U.S. commercial, not-for-profit, or joint ventures), that can provide digitization services in support of its large scale legacy digitization initiative.  This initiative encompasses digitizing OSTIâ€™s sizeable collection of approximately 850,000 reports (50 million pages). The work scope will include a formal non-monetary collaboration which will provide mutual beneficial results to both parties. The work must be performed at the DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) facility located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. OSTI is a DOE program within the Office of Science, whose mission is to advance science and sustain technological creativity by making R&D findings available and useful to DOE researchers and the American people. Should DOE, in its sole discretion, elect to issue a solicitation, DOE intends to require qualified interested parties to demonstrate that they have or would be able to obtain all required personnel and equipment to accomplish, at a minimum, the following (at contractorâ€™s expense): â€¢ For each digitized item, create a machine-readable file via an Optical Character Reader (OCR) that will accompany the digitized item. â€¢ Provide to OSTI an electronic copy of each digitized item together with the OCR file. â€¢ Accommodate special handling required of fragile documents. â€¢ Index the digitized copy via the Site Map protocol already adopted by OSTI, so that contractor can offer contractor's customers the ability to search the legacy collection. â€¢ Integrate an electronic means of attribution to OSTI within the digitized copy of each document. â€¢ Provide periodic status reports outlining progress. â€¢ Within a 5 year timeframe, complete the digitization of the entire OSTI legacy collection. In response to any future solicitation, all qualified interested parties would be required to undergo a Foreign Ownership Control and Influence (FOCI) review.  In addition, background checks would be required on all personnel performing work. DOE reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner DOE determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the creation of a competitive solicitation.

<CONTACT>Reggie James, Contracting Officer, 202-586-1487, reggie.james@rw.doe.gov;Reggie James, Contract Specialist, 202-586-1487, reggie.james@rw.doe.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to obtain comments from potential vendors of facilities or services (e.g., railroad owners, designers, construction contractors, railroad maintainers and railroad operators) related to the design, construction and operation of a railroad in Nevada to facilitate shipping spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level radioactive waste (HLW) to a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  Because the existing rail network does not connect directly to Yucca Mountain, a new rail line to Yucca Mountain from one of the existing main rail lines in Nevada needs to be built.  Industry standards would be used for designing, constructing, and putting into operation a railroad connecting the national rail system to Yucca Mountain.  Figure 1 shows the existing lines and possible corridors for a new rail line. On April 8, 2004 (69 FR 18565) DOE issued a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Alignment, Construction, and Operation of a Rail Line to a Geologic Repository at Yucca Mountain, Nye County, NV (Rail Alignment EIS).  The proposed action was to determine a rail alignment and construct and operate a rail line to Yucca Mountain from a site near Caliente, Nevada.  On October 13, 2006 (71 FR 60484) DOE issued an Amended Notice of Intent to expand the scope of the Rail Alignment EIS to also analyze a newly proposed Mina corridor. An overview of the program and information related to Transporting Nuclear Waste is available at (http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/). With this notice, the DOE is seeking comments from potential vendors concerning the appropriate strategy for a competitive procurement that supports the objectives of the high-level waste management program and is attractive to potential offerors. Your comments will help DOE refine the procurement strategy and will provide a basis for the discussions with potential vendors in the initial stage of the process.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), on behalf of the National Institute of National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small business organizations interested in this requirement.  This acquisition may be solicited as full and open or as small business set-aside including 8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veterans as defined by the Small Business Act.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Small Business sources are sought that possess the capability to provide support services described below for the NCRR.  The new contract is anticipated to be awarded on September 30, 2007 for a period of five years. 

As part of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research process to Reengineer the Clinical Research Enterprise, NIH issued an RFA for institutional Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA).  The purpose of the CTSA initiative, which is a joint NCRR and NIH Roadmap activity, is to assist institutions to forge a uniquely transformative, novel, and integrative academic home for Clinical and Translational Science.  These new Clinical and Translational Science entities are expected to serve as a magnet that concentrates basic, translational, and clinical investigators, community clinicians, clinical practices, networks, professional societies, and industry to facilitate the development of new professional interactions, programs, and research projects. It is anticipated that these new institutional arrangements, coupled with innovative advanced degree programs, will foster the development of a new discipline of Clinical and Translational Science that will be both broader and more pervasive than the classical and separate domains of translational research and clinical investigation.  When fully implemented in 2012, about 60 CTSA programs will be supported.

As part of this cooperative initiative, CTSA awardees will participate in trans-CTSA Steering Committees in areas of broad interest to discuss and address national issues through sharing and cooperation.  Although NIH anticipates that awardees will differ in their internal structures and emphasis, informatics, human protection, training, and clinical service are envisioned to be areas of shared interest with national level Steering Committees for each area.  Project management and technical support of these Steering Committees in their cooperative activities will be necessary for accomplishment of shared projects.
The purpose of this acquisition is to seek small business organizations capable of providing project management and technical support for the institutional CTSA program.  The Contractor shall provide technical support to the NCRR Division of Clinical Research for CTSA activities where the current staffing and research management resources are limited.  Contractor activities shall include: 1) project management/executive secretary staffing for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working groups; 2) establish, maintain, and manage a web based password protected collaborative workspace for above groups; 3) establish, maintain, and manage a public CTSA web site for dissemination of activities and products; 4) logistics and meeting support services for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working Group meetings; 5) provision of qualified subcontracted or consultant technical expertise in a timely fashion; 6) administrative management and oversight for the review process of informatics pilot projects; and 7) provision of contract closeout and orderly transition.  

Interested firms that are classified under NAICS code 541710 should furnish capability information addressing the following:  

(a)	the experience of the organization in performing other similar contract programs

(b)	ability to prepare Annual Performance and Operating Plans 

(c)	the ability of the organization to effectively and quickly obtain and manage subcontracts, for highly specialized technical services not performed in-house, and maintain complete and effective labor, technical, and management control of the program

(d)	the ability of the organization to provide high level project management staffing  for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working Groups; the personnel must provide careful attention to detail, organizational skill, excellent oral and written skills, ability to work independently, and working knowledge of a variety of technical areas related to clinical and translational research

(e)	the ability of the organization to provide appropriate project management and planning processes, including staffing, scheduling, reporting, and cost control; ability and experience of the organization to effectively transition at the start and end of similar contracts and to adapt quickly to different workload levels over time

(f)	experience and competence in managing the independent review and evaluation of scientific and technical proposals in a timely fashion, including the provision of evaluation reports

(g)	the ability of the organization to develop and revise technical documents, in the most efficient and cost-effective manner

(h)	the ability of the organization to provide IT support services, including programming, website development and hosting and database development; the ability to provide password protected web based collaborative work space for collaborative groups with appropriate attention to IT security issues.

(i)	the ability of the organization to arrange and support professional meetings in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, including consideration of travel and other meeting-related tasks and expenses; ability to provide access to and management of various mechanisms for virtual meetings, including but not limited to, telephone and video conferencing

(j)	the ability of the organization to meet with NCRR staff at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland with as little as two hours advance notice


This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and none is available.  An original and two copies of the capability statement should be submitted to:

<SUBJECT>S--Management and Disposal of solid waste
<SOLNBR>RFI889607099
<RESPDATE>071907
<ARCHDATE>06272008
<CONTACT>Tekla Vines Contracting Officer 8085724486 tekla_s_vines@nps.gov;
<DESC>I.  BACKGROUND A.  The National Park Service (NPS) announces a market survey to obtain market information from potential contractors regarding business type, size, and capabilities to accomplish refuse collection and disposal services for waste generated at Kalaupapa National Historical Park, located on the Kalaupapa peninsula of the island of Molokai.  Waste generation estimates range from approximately 92 tons per year currently to up to 249 tons per year in the future.  To reduce the environmental impacts of waste disposal, the NPS plans to implement a comprehensive program that includes three components:   1) recycling; 2) composting and; 3) disposal.  Based on the waste composition, it is estimated that 26% of the tonnage generated can be recycled, 37% composted and the remainder 37% to be disposed of.  It is also estimated that approximately an additional 60-65 tons per year of construction & demolition (C&D) debris from building maintenance activities will be generated from Kalaupapa for disposal.  The NPS will collect, process and package the waste at Kalaupapa to facilitate transportation and disposal.  The information gathered from this Sources Sought notice will be used in the formulation of the acquisition strategy for this requirement.    A period of performance of a 12-month base period plus four 12-month options is anticipated.     The Contractor shall be responsible for providing all necessary management, supervision, personnel, equipment necessary to pick up the waste as described below, and transport it to a certified disposal or recycling facility for disposal, and transporting empty containers back to Honolulu dock for shipment on  the annual NPS barge to Kalaupapa. II.  SCOPE OF SERVICES A.  Recycling  1.   Over the course of each year, the NPS will collect and store the recyclables (current estimate of 35 tons to future estimate of 57 tons, including paper, plastic, and metals), compacting them into 60"x48"x30" bales.  Each bale will contain the same recyclable, e.g. corrugated cardboard, office paper, HDPE plastic, PET plastic, aluminum cans, etc.     The bales will be stored at Kalaupapa National Historical Park in 20 ft. cargo containers.  The number of cargo containers is anticipated to be 2 to 3 per year initially and may increase to 6 to 7 containers per year in the future.  Once yearly, NPS will barge the full cargo containers from Kalaupapa to the Port of Honolulu. 2	i.  For the initial year (anticipated to be 2008), the barge sailing day will be in July and the contractor would provide pick-up and delivery of empty containers from a leasing company, (under separate contract w/NPS), to the Port of Honolulu for transport to Kalaupapa by barge.  	ii.  For subsequent years, the barge sailing day would also be in July.  The contractor would provide pick-up and delivery of empty containers from the leasing company to the Port of Honolulu for barge transport to Kalaupapa.  Upon the barge's return from Kalaupapa approximately five to seven days later, contractor would provide pick-up and transport of filled containers from the Port of Honolulu to an authorized recycler in Honolulu, and return the newly emptied containers to the leasing company.   B.   Air Transport of Packaged Refuse and Disposal from Kalaupapa to Landfill 1.   After diversion to recycling and on-site composting, NPS will compact and package the remaining waste into small cubes, approximately 20"x 20"x 18", and 40 lbs per cube.  The current estimated quantity is about 28 cubes per week.   This quantity may increase to up to 70 cubes per week in the future.   2.  NPS will package waste twice a week (possibly reducing to once a week in the future).  It is desired that the packages be transported on the same or next day of packaging to minimize the attractive nuisance.   NPS will transport these cubes to the Kalaupapa airport for contractor pick-up. 3.  Service is anticipated to begin in fiscal year 2008, starting in October 2007 through September 2008.  The contractor would provide air transportation for the packages from Kalaupapa to Honolulu Airport and then on to final disposal at an approved landfill or to a waste-to-energy facility in Honolulu.  C  Hauling and Disposal of Construction & Demolition (C&D) Waste 1.  Once a year, NPS will barge an estimated 60-65 tons of C&D waste from Kalaupapa National Historical Park to the Port of Honolulu, typically in July. 2.  Contractor provides containers on a yearly basis to Kalaupapa, beginning in 2008, to contain C&D waste as it being generated from Park activities.   The full containers would be placed by the NPS on the NPS barge in July of the following year and transported from Kalaupapa NHP to the Port of Honolulu.  The contractor would then pick up the full containers at the Port of Honolulu, and transport them to an authorized C&D landfill for disposal.  The replacement container set would need to be delivered to the barge company approximately 5 days prior to the sailing date to Kalaupapa.  The full containers from Kalaupapa need to be picked up from the Port of Honolulu within the time as agreed to by the barge company (generally within one day of barge arrival).   NPS will barge empty containers to Kaluapapa and offload them.  Service will begin July 2008 for providing an empty set of containers only, and full service as described above will commence in July 2009. D. Best Value - Any firm may propose alternatives to the above methodologies if the alternative can achieve the same goals in a more efficient and cost effective manner.    THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine potential and eligible business firms capable of providing the services described herein.  The Government is not obigated to and will not pay any costs incurred in the preparation of any submission to this market survey.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  Developing and testing new vaccines and therapies have historically been a major focus of the research supported by the DMID.  Much of this research is devoted to addressing critical public health needs, such as those related to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g., avian influenza and West Nile Virus), as well as those supporting the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).  

In August 2000, NIAID awarded a contract to provide a wide variety of regulatory support services for DMID clinical research activities, including clinical site monitoring, management and preparation of regulatory files, and management and operation of a clinical agent and clinical specimen repository.  This contract provides for the establishment and operation of a Clinical Agent and Specimen Repository (CASR) that adheres to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for the acquisition, receipt, storage and shipping of clinical agents and clinical specimens in support of DMID sponsored clinical trials and research programs in the U.S. and abroad.  Regulatory support services are currently being recompeted through a separate contract solicitation.

Clinical agents include study products (drugs, vaccines, and therapeutics), commercial products, placebos, syringes, and other protocol-mandated supplies to be used in DMID-sponsored clinical trials.  For the purposes of this contract, other protocol-mandated supplies include electronic adherence measuring devices and associated devices for downloading data, thermometers, oral syringes, adaptors for transferring liquids from bottles to syringes, syringes for injection, and pregnancy test kits. Clinical specimens include sera or other protocol-mandated specimens obtained from DMID-funded clinical research sites, to be distributed to DMID approved testing laboratories for analysis.  The current DMID Regulatory Affairs Support contractor will provide the Contractor with the existing DMID-owned Clinical Agent Repository Inventory Management (CARIM) Database System. The CARIM database is used in conjunction with the DMID owned regulatory affairs support Human Subjects Research Oversight and Accountability Database (HSROAD) which has an electronic ordering module.    
Currently both databases are being managed by the DMID Regulatory Affairs Support contractor.  

Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements: 1) Receipt, appropriate storage, monitoring, distribution and disposition of clinical agents from product suppliers in support of DMID-sponsored clinical research 2) Labeling, packaging and repacking of clinical agents for distribution to DMID-funded clinical research sites and DMID approved testing laboratories 3) Receipt of all required shipping documents 4) Validation of packaging and shipping procedures for the shipment of clinical agents under correct temperature conditions 5) Monitoring of product inventories and expiration dates 6) Acquisition of clinical agents and non-clinical testing 7) Receipt, short-term storage (two-years), monitoring, distribution, and disposition of clinical specimens in support of DMID sponsored clinical research 8) Aliquoting, labeling, of clinical specimens for distribution to DMID approved testing laboratories 9) Maintenance and operation of an electronic system for requesting services and tracking agents and specimens.  There will be three options under this acquisition:

Option 1: The Contractor shall increase clinical specimen capacity of the CASR in order to accommodate the following:
	-80oC (approximately 1600 cu. ft.)
	-20oC (approximately 1600 cu. ft.)
Option 2: The Contractor shall increase the length of time for the storage of clinical specimens in the CASR to exceed the short-term storage requirement of two (2) years as specified in the base requirement, to provide for storage until the end of the contract period of performance.  

Option 3: The Government may extend the contract for up to an additional two (2) years beyond the contract base period of performance.  

Capability statements submitted by potential sources as a result of this announcement should demonstrate the offerors? qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to perform this requirement, with particular attention to:

Technical Approach: adequacy, appropriateness and feasibility of approaches to providing the proposed clinical agent and clinical specimen repository services.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO), Falls Church, VA, is conducting market research to identify other (non-DoD) Federal agencies, private sector sources (industry), and academia that can provide assistance to DISA in acquiring information technology (IT) capabilities supporting command and control functions and operating in a services-based (services oriented architecture (SOA)) environment, in new and agile ways.  DISA already has numerous processes to identify and obtain such capabilities and services from DoD organizations and traditional DoD industrial partners.  DISA is looking for innovative suggestions to acquire similar services from non-traditional sources and intends to employ a capability broker, as described later in this RFI, to assist and advise the JPMO and Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO). Recognizing that desired capabilities are continually emerging, NECCs market research efforts are expected to continue throughout the life of the program.  The insights gained from this market research will support efforts to reduce program risk, maintain schedules, and control acquisition costs while gaining access to new and more effective technologies. 

The NECC program works particularly closely with DISAs Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program since the programs technologies and architectures are closely associated. Additional general  information regarding the NECC program can be found at the following web site: http://www.disa.mil/necc/overview.html. Additional general information regarding the NCES program can be found at the following web site: http://www.disa.mil/nces/. 

Many capabilities, services, and technologies, both those that respond directly to warfighter needs and those that do so indirectly through improved infrastructure operations, will not originate within the Defense Information Systems Agency. Academia, non-DoD related private sector commercial organizations (including those that are consumer-focused), the Federal civilian agencies, the national laboratories, and other communities are actively doing work of potential value to the NECC program. The NECC program is creating a construct to learn about such work, determine which functionalities could become Capability Modules (CMs), and implement the way-ahead with potential provider organizations. CMs are defined as are small, loosely coupled, militarily useful services (pieces of software) resident on the Global Information Grid (GIG) that can be coupled or mashed to suit a particular mission, place, and time.

The NECC program will solicit best practices, lessons learned, ideas, and requirements and specifications through a variety of information sharing activities. To date, NECC has held broad outreach events and numerous one-on-one exchanges with companies and organizations.  NECC intends to continue this information exchange between the Government and other sources.  DISA still needs private and public sector assistance in finding and delivering capabilities and services to meet DoDs requirement using an agile  procurement process that will occur on a smaller scale than in the past. 

One particular aspect of the NECC program will be the employment of a third party capability broker.   Once DISAs NECC program defines capability architecture, NECC will use the capability broker to identify and nominate specific technologies and capabilities from the public sector outside DoD, the private sector, or other organizations/activities. NECC may acquire some computing capabilities as a managed service or buy easy-to-implement commercial solutions, and subdivide large projects into smaller components that can be combined using service-oriented architecture (SOA) specifications and standards. 

The capability broker is an individual or small team of personnel who will continuously review the market for technological opportunities to meet capability needs of NECC. The broker may be, for example, a small or large business, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center, or an academic organization. Prospective brokers shall identify any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, as described in FAR Part 2 and FAR Subpart 9.5, when responding to this Request For Information (RFI).  For additional information, see DARS Clause 52.209-9000, Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest (OCCI) (December 2005), which is likely to be in any resulting solicitation and contract. DISA comes to the table with technically capable engineers and acquisition experts to contribute to the process. A new approach is to include commercial companies which have led in using emerging technical solutions and processes, to assist DoD in applying commercial best practices to result in a higher success rate for IT initiatives.

The Defense Information Systems Agency is requesting information from appropriate companies or other parties interested in the NECC capability broker strategy. DISA is particularly interested in innovative and creative ideas for: identifying SOA-enabled software services or capabilities components of potential military C2 utility; for engaging with originators of such components; for acquiring components in a developmental, test, or operational state at little or no incremental cost to the Government; for techniques for configuration management and control, and performance management, of third-party software in a distributed, web-enabled environment, etc. 

NECCs requirements for speed, agility and adaptability prohibit proprietary solutions or tightly coupled systems. NECCs preference is for a loose SOA framework to link modules that NECC can add and subtract from at will. Previously, the Government acquired monolithic systems using proprietary technologies.

<SUBJECT>70 -- LeoStream Software Maintenance
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to renew the annual maintenance of LeoStream software products for approximately $145,000.  Leostream is an application server with agents that enables full-featured management of VMWare.  Advanced features include automated fail over and scalability to manage up to 25,000 VMs across a Wide Area Network.  Leostream has already been deployed successfully in a variety of projects in our information technology lab and production environments to support workstations for the approved USPTO Enterprise Remote Access (Telework) solution. This procurement is for the second phase of a three year implementation plan that was defined in the Patent Hoteling Program Business Execution Plan of August 3, 2005. There has been no change in the design and no new products are being purchased. This procurement is solely for additional licenses and maintenance support of the products that were put into use after the initial procurement that was executed with the BNJ dated May 24, 2006. Any attempt to replace Leostream with a different brand on a schedule more aggressive than the one currently in place, will cause USPTO not to meet Congressional mandates.

This announcement is considered a ?brand name? justification.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). The acquisition will be conducted utilizing existing Blanket Purchase Agreements for Information Technology products within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed by email to Connie Lum at connie.lum@uspto.gov.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information for TIGDL II Replacement
<DESC>SPAWAR Systems Center Charleston seeks information on a replacement system for the U.S. Marine Corpsâ€™ TIGDL II (Tactical Interoperable Ground Data Link Two) communications terminal by 31 Jul 2007. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit information that may be used for the near-term procurement of a TIGDL II replacement. The TIGDL II is a component of the USMC Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG), a deployable imagery analysis system developed and maintained by the Marine Corps. This RFI addresses the feasibility of procuring a TIGDL II replacement that will exceed the functionality and supportability of the current TIGDL II system and maintain existing interfaces and compatibility with the other components of the TEG. A comprehensive response to this RFI will enable SPAWAR to determine the future path for the acquisition of a tactical ground CDL system that will support multiple data rate, dual band (X and Ku), full-duplex legacy and networked communications with present and future CDL-equipped airborne platforms. It is requested that you notify us of factors in our requirements that would prevent you from being a viable competitor. Our goal is to procure a tactical, supportable, modular and fully CDL-compliant system that is backward compatible with currently deployed CDL systems, but also incorporates new technologies and functionalities which are called out in the current Revision F and proposed Revision G versions of the CDL Class I Specification. This Request for Information (RFI) is a means for gathering pertinent information necessary to fulfill the existing system need for direct air-ground downlink of airborne ISR data to support USMC theater and tactical imagery requirements. Suppliers should make every effort to respond to all or part of this RFI, as the government intends to utilize information provided for both current as well as future system requirements. A. Minimum Capabilities. Current TIGDL-II capabilities and backward compatibility are the minimum expected of a deliverable system. Developed future systems must comply with CDL interoperability specifications, be backward compatible with existing airborne CDL systems that can presently link with TIGDL II, interface with existing TEG components, and meet Department of Defense (DoD) technical architecture and information assurance requirements. B. Objective System Description. The TEG Program Office has identified several technical challenges that must be overcome by the TIGDL II replacement. These challenges include significant reduction in size, weight and power (SWaP), development of a modular system supportive of future extensibility, transportability in transit cases meeting DoD standards for two-person lift, increased reliability and maintainability, and the use of current interfaces with existing TEG components, such as the Common Imagery Processor (CIP). Additionally, the TEG Program Office is interested in information to support the procurement of additional, new or replacement technologies which support the overall TEG mission, such as:  other communication sources, for example, Global Broadcast System, JSTARS, SATCOM links; a replacement system for the CIP; and integration of proposed, new CDL waveforms. REQUESTED INFORMATION 1. Technical Performance:  Interested parties should provide a matrix of baseline and optional capabilities to be included in their TIGDL II replacement system that address the system needs defined above in paragraphs A and B. Interested parties are reminded that the TIGDL II replacement will operate in conjunction with, and as a component of, the larger TEG system.  Additionally, the TIGDL II replacement will be operated and maintained in a USMC tactical field environment. 2.  Schedule and Resources: To meet current program milestones and operational commitments, the target delivery date for a fully operational TIGDL II replacement system is December 2008. Interested parties should identify key milestones and interim deliveries (as applicable) to facilitate TEG integration and system delivery. If December 2008 represents significant schedule risk, present the schedule that is representative of a low risk program. Please also identify key resources and facility (manufacturing, integration and test) requirements for the execution of the effort and provide a top-level schedule of development, as necessary. For scheduling and planning purposes, a first article build for the TIGDL II replacement might be required to support TEG program and operational requirements.  This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation will be issued at this time.  We are only seeking information. Submit responses to Senior Contract Negotiator, Deborah D. McNeely, Code 026DM, via e-mail at deborah.mcneely@navy.mil by 31 July 2007 at 1400 EST.

GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS
 
 1.1 Scope of Services
  
The National Forests in North Carolina is accepting bids for survey to determine the nature and location of heritage resources on 592 acres of selected lands in Davidson, Montgomery and Randolph Counties, North Carolina.  
 
The Contractor shall provide all services, facilities, materials, and supplies required for the performance and completion of the project outlined herein, except where otherwise specified.
 

The objectives of the project are to identify, record and evaluate historic, ethnohistoric and prehistoric properties (Heritage Resources) that could be affected by proposed timber activities.  Reports and other data derived from this project will be used for Environmental Analysis input and in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended. 
 
 
To accomplish these objectives, the Contractor shall review existing sources of information on the environment, prehistory and history of the general project area, including Forest Service Land Status Files in Asheville or Troy, NC; conduct an intensive (Level III) field survey of the areas defined on the attached maps, flag National Register eligible and potentially eligible sites in the field; complete North Carolina state site inventory records for each site discovered; analyze the results of this investigation, including, but not limited to, recommendations regarding site significance in terms of National Register of Historic Place criteria; and prepare, furnish, and deliver to the Forest Service a report in original and four  
		(4) copies describing the methods and results of the study by October 15, 2007.

	Location
 

 
The area selected for study consists of the following: 
2007 First Thinning Areas, 592 acres in Compartments 2,7,9,10,11,12,14,15,16,21,25,26,31,32,33,34, & 35, Davidson, Montgomery and Randolph Counties, Badin, Eleazer, High Rock, Lovejoy Morrow Mountain and Troy quadrangles.  See Attachment A.  Lodging and supplies are available in the nearby towns of Albemarle, Asheboro, Biscoe and Troy.  
 
 
Government-Furnished Assistance
 

 
1.3.1 Services
 
 
The Forest Service shall provide access to such information in its possession as it deems pertinent to the project, including archaeological and historical inventory data, environmental data and reports, aerial photos, maps, and other relevant information.  This shall include the availability of Forest Service personnel and resource specialists for technical consultation as needed for the orderly and efficient development of the project.  Topographic maps of the area showing National Forest property lines of the survey area will be furnished to the Contractor.  Flagging tape will also be made available to the Contractor.
 
 
Published Soil Survey reports on file will be available for inspection and study by the contractor at the Supervisor?s Office in Asheville, NC.
 

1.3.2 Fieldwork Coordination
 

The Contractor shall coordinate field activities with the Forest Service Archeologist and the District Ranger.  Background studies and other activities will be coordinated with the Uwharrie Zone Archeologist.  
 

 Professional Quality Controls
 

All laboratory, office, and field work performed under this contract is to be in accord with standards prescribed by the 1906 Antiquities Act and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 with programming rules and regulations (36 CFR 296), and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.
 
 
1.5 Personnel
 

 
All of the tasks described herein are to be accomplished under the supervision of a Principal Investigator (PI) trained to the ?PhD/MA  competence level? with a demonstrable background in archaeology and history, relevant to the project area, and can document the successful administration and completion of projects of a similar nature.  By ?PhD/MA competence level,? it is meant that the Forest Service will consider Principal Investigators trained to a lesser academic level if their vitae support ?PhD/MA competence? for the purposes of this contract.  Other key personnel, namely field and lab supervisors, must have demonstrable experience in archaeology and history relevant to the project area, experience in report preparation, analysis of heritage resource properties, and analysis of archaeological materials. 

Names and vitae for the Principal Investigator and all key personnel (as defined) must be submitted with a proposal.  Names and vitae for trained technicians and/or students who will serve as crew for the project do not have to be submitted with a proposal, but will be submitted when work begins.  Any changes in key personnel after commencement of the project must be approved by the Contracting Officer.
 
 
 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
 
 
2.1 Heritage Resource Survey Requirements
 
 
The Contractor shall meet with the Forest Service Archeologist in Asheville or Troy, NC, and/or representative prior to initiating field work for the purpose of (1) reviewing the undertaking and discussing the project objectives; (2) reviewing Forest Service Heritage Resource Inventory information; (3) examining pertinent natural resource data, reports, maps, etc; (4) becoming acquainted with the natural and cultural features of the project area; and (5) discussing field plans and coordination with Forest personnel, including the District Ranger and representatives.
 

2.2 Survey Intensity Level
 

 
This is to be an intensive field inventory, in that the heritage resource sites in the project area are to be located, and sufficient data retrieved to evaluate sites for eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
 

		Sites will be described by Forest Service site classes:
 
 
Class I - Listed in or determined eligible to the NRHP.
 
 
Unevaluated- Potentially eligible to the NRHP, further testing required.
 
 
Class III - Not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
 

 
The survey area will be subjected to pedestrian survey.  Since management decisions and directions for future work are based on initial survey results, it is essential that enough information be obtained to make informed decisions.  Consequently subsurface testing, which can provide information about depth, site boundaries, and deposit integrity is required. 
 
 
Site definition to be used during survey is the presence of two or more artifacts/features (material evidence of human use) within a definable area on a single landform or on contiguous landforms.  Isolated finds are still provided a site number and site form following the policy employed by the North Carolina Office of State Archeology.  All sites are recorded on state site forms and located on 7.5? USGS topographic maps.

Site locations will be plotted with hand held Global Positioning System (GPS) units.  Isolated finds may be denoted by one reading, while larger sites will need multiple readings to verify both location and extent.  Trees closest to GPS readings will be marked with white latex (spray) paint with a double circular band to aid site relocation.
 
 
Field techniques involve pedestrian walk-over by two or more persons in parallel 20 to 30 meter transects for complete coverage of the project acreage.  Subsurface tests are made every 20 to 25 meters along the transects.  Subsurface testing will be conducted in all areas except those that are justified not to require subsurface testing (excellent visibility, disturbance).  Cleared areas, such as trails, roads, tree throws and tree bases will be examined when available.

The entire project area must be investigated to an extent to ensure location of all sites.  All landforms expected to contain sites will be subsurface tested (minimum of 30 cm diameter tests screened through ? inch mesh).  Additional tests may be necessary to define site limits and larger tests may be needed to assess and/or evaluate sites.  The test depths vary between less than 5 cm to well over 30 cm depending on the area.  An auger is also employed in some areas because of soil depth associated with flood plain deposits.    

Site field numbers will be assigned according to the Forest Service designations:  District abbreviation, Compartment number ? Site number ? Calendar year, eg., UW40-1-07 is the first site recorded on the Uwharrie National Forest in Compartment 40 in 2007. 
 
 
	Copyright
 

 
The Contractor agrees to indemnify the U.S. Government against any claim of copyright infringement which may result by reason of publication, by the U.S. Government, of material in any report pertaining to the contract work submitted by the Contractor wherein any such previously printed material is not identified in the reports as copyrighted.  The Contractor agrees that no rights at common law or inequity shall be asserted, and no claims to copyright by statute shall be established by the Contractor in any materials produced in the performance of this contract, and that all materials and deliverables become the property of the U.S. Government.  The results of this project may be used for research and other reasonable and lawful purposes by U.S. Government and non-government agencies and individuals subject to prior written approval of the Forest Service.
 
 
	Property Recording
 

All heritage resource properties observed shall be recorded on North Carolina state site inventory records.  The necessary inventory records are obtainable from the Forest Service Archeologist.  
 

Controls for Removed Materials, Sub-Surface Tests, Etc.
 
 
All collected materials shall be turned over to the Uwharrie Zone Archeologist with the Final Report for permanent retention, unless otherwise specified.
 
	
	2.7 Ancillary Documents Disposition
 

All ancillary documents expressly associated with the conduct of this project, such as, but not limited to, field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs with negatives, are to be turned over 
by the Contractor with the artifact collections to the Uwharrie Zone Archeologist.  All such materials remain the property of the U.S. Government and are to be made available to the Forest Service and other Federal agencies upon the lawful and reasonable request of authorized personnel.
 

	2.8 Report Requirements
 

 
2.8.1 General
 
 
A final report must be submitted to the Forest Service Archeologist in the original and four copies (total of five copies).  Copies may be Xerox-type photocopies except one should include prints from negatives.  Legibility of the copies will be evaluated and accepted by the Forest Service Archeologist.  The original must be of a publishable quality and unbound.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.
This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Request For Quotation (RFQ) number is 
N66604-07-Q-3856. Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2000-07. This is 100% set-aside for small business. Size standard is 1000. NUWC Division Newport intends to purchase the following items: Ten (10) each of HHPC-4 Quad 21160 PCI Board with 64M Memory; Five (5) each of HHPM-45-08-001 Quad 21160 PCM Board with 64M Memory; and Five (5) each of CACH-L26-12 Honda Connectors, Link 26 Pin, 12 Link Port cables.  Required delivery is 14 days after award, F.O.B. Destination Naval Station Newport; Newport, RI. It is expected to place a purchase order with Bittware, 31-B South Main St., Concord, NH 03301. They are the only known source for these items because Bittware has the only quad processor boards capable of inputting serial analog data and convert it to digital format for use by the CPU.  Because of the magnitude of the system, NUWC requires a high speed card that is compatible with the PCI and PCM slots on the computer.  NUWC has developed a core system around the Hammerhead Boards from Bittware and the Linux Operating system and have spent significant effort developing a baseline system using this hardware.  The software drivers required to control this system have already been written specific to the existing boards.  Introducing another vendor?s board would require rewriting all the codes that have been written to date adding significant cost and time to the program.   All other timely offers will be considered. Offers for other products must contain complete product information and prices. FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items applies. Evaluation will be in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items. Evaluation factors are technical capability, price and past performance. Each is equally important.  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, and DFARS 52.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items apply. The following addenda or additional terms and conditions apply: none. Offers should include price and delivery terms and the following additional information: none required. Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating of DO-C9 applies. Offers must be submitted to Commercial Acquisition, Building 11, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, Code 11912, Simonpietri Drive, Newport, Rhode Island 02841-1708 or may be faxed to 401-832-4820.

Special Note:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This procurement will be performed in accordance with FAR 13 --- Simplified Acquisitions. Evaluations will be performed in accordance with FAR 13.106-2.

It is up to the contractor to propose any past performance information, technical approach, etc. to help NTIS decide which contractor is best for the effort.  A "Best Value" approach will be employed. At a minimum, the contractor should possess good communication skills, including written and verbal presentations.  The contractor should also have experience in leading action teams to successful outcomes.  In addition, the contractor should also submit the resume (no more than 3 pages) of the individual proposed to fulfill this statement of work.  Most importantly, the individual proposed must have the personnel qualifications to accomplish the work.

The period of performance will be approximately August 1, 2007 to July 30, 2008.

The procurement will not exceed $100,000 and it is not expected that the contractor will be working on this project full time.


Statement of Requirements:

Background

1.1	The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) serves our nation as the largest central resource for government-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and business related information available today. Its mission is to promote progress by serving as the Federal Government's central means of making technical information perpetually and widely available.  Its vision is to ensure easy and perpetual availability of the most comprehensive collection of Federally-funded scientific, technical, and engineering information (STEI) as well as business-related information in support of the Nation's economic growth and opportunity. For 60 years NTIS has assured businesses, universities, and the public timely access to well over 3 million publications covering over 350 subject areas. The NTIS mission supports the nation's economic growth by providing access to information that stimulates innovation and discovery.  NTIS is self-sustaining, and what it does is in the public good.  NTIS Senior Staff has spent time throughout the year creating and updating the Strategic Plan for 2006 through 2010.  That planning process identified a number of strategic roadmap projects, including re-engineering of key operational processes.  The key operational processes which require significant re-engineering and are the focus of this contract are metadata creation process and the collection (harvesting) and dissemination of information.

1.2	This Contract identifies key programmatic tasks that require knowledgeable project management support that is essential to the successful implementation of the NTIS Strategic Plan.  Support must be comprehensive in that the accomplishment of the tasks requires technical expertise as well as the ability to acquire quickly a detailed knowledge of the NTIS mission, strategy, management philosophy and processes.  Support also must be flexible, since the actions necessary to achieve the Strategic Plan's goals may require adjustment in response to events and situations that will occur in the future.  The NTIS nevertheless will expect the Contractor to provide responsive and stable support for one full year.

2.0	Project Management

The Contractor shall provide oversight and guidance to a team of NTIS employees and an outside consultant (Information International Associates) in support of the re-engineering of the abstracting, indexing and cataloging processes used by NTIS.  The Contractor will also provide support to management for special projects, which may include mass digitization, information harvesting and dissemination.
3.0 Tasks
3.1 Task 1.  Project Management for Reengineering the Metadata Creation Process
The goal of this task is to provide oversight and guidance to the strategic project team working on the NTIS abstracting, cataloging and indexing processes to significantly improve the quality and consistency of the cataloging, abstracting and indexing processes while dramatically improving the productivity and timeliness of the throughput process.  A second goal is to provide independent updates and assessments of the project team's progress and recommendations to NTIS Senior Management.  The project manager will be responsible for managing the project team to deliver the following tasks.  Management responsibilities will include calling meetings, reviewing interim work product, coordinating assignments, reporting to management on progress and recommendations. 
1.	Outline the process flow of the current operations and develop recommendations on changes to be made and a future systems design. Recommend comprehensive list of changes to process, taxonomy, tools, raining, skill sets, standards of performance, etc. for implementation
2.	Work with NTIS senior managers to gain understanding an approval of the planned changes
3.	Develop a project plan including milestone driven timelines to re-engineer the A&I processes.  Get approval of the plan.
4.	Support the implementation of recommended changes.  This work is to include support NTIS management in implementation, including staffing and training of employees.
3.2 Task 2.  Special Project Support to Management
The goal of this task is to provide support to senior management on special projects as requested.  This support may include research, report writing and/or meetings to discuss recommendations.
4.0	Deliverables

4.1	Monthly Report

Once each month, the Contractor shall submit a progress report covering work accomplished during that period of the contract performance.  The progress report shall be brief and factual and shall be prepared in accordance with the following format:

a.	Cover page containing:
(1)	Contract number and title;
(2)	Type of report, sequence number of report, and period of performance being reported;
(3)	Contractor's name and address;
(4)	Author(s); and
(5)	Date of report.

b.	SECTION I  An introduction covering the purpose and scope of the contract effort.  This shall be limited to one paragraph.

c.	SECTION II  Highlights of progress for each task or other logical segment of work on which effort was expended during the reporting period.  

d.	SECTION III  A planning schedule shall be included with the first progress report for all assigned tasks required under the contract, along with the estimated starting and completion dates for each task.  The planning schedule shall be updated and submitted with each subsequent technical progress report.  Provide an explanation of any difference between actual progress and planned progress, why the differences have occurred, and if behind planned progress, what corrective steps are planned.

e. SECTION IV  A description of current technical or substantive performance and any problem(s) that may impede performance along with proposed corrective action.


If there are any questions, please call Mr. Michael Scheuchenzuber on (703) 605-6116 or E-Mail mscheuchenzuber@ntis.gov.  Do not call on (301) 975-3978.

<DESC>This amendment is accomplished to make changes to RFQ NAMA-07-Q-0044, specifically the e-mailed ladder specifications. Section 3.2.1 of the specifications, Frames, Rails and Diagonals, is changed from, ?? inch nominal pipe size at manufacturer?s option?, to read as follows, ?a maximum one (1) inch nominal pipe size at manufacturer?s option?.  This change reflects the latest specifications for standard NARA pulpit ladders. As a result of the specification change, the responses due date has been extended to July 3, 2007 3pm EST to allow vendors time to quote changes to their ladder design, if any.  Any questions concerning the specification change should be addressed to Damon Nevils, Contract Specialist, National Archives at phone: 301-837-0771, Fax: 301-837-3227 or by e-mail: damon.nevils@nara.gov.

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted.

Technical questions and responses are hereby provided:

Question:
1) Is this for an upright or inverted microscope?

Answer:
It could be either.  Our primary concern is obtaining a system with a very low level of vibration.  In general, we expect that inverted microscopes would have greater stability and lower levels of vibration, and thus better meet our needs.  

Question:
2) Is this microscope motorized or manual?  
3) If motorized, which components are to be motorized?

Answer:
It could be either.  We do not require motorized stage motion or focusing.  We expect that most modern microscopes have motorized apertures in the illumination optics.

Question:
4) Do you want me to quote light sources for incident and transmitted light,
and if so, what types?

Answer:
Yes; light sources should be standard halogen lamps.

Question:
5) Do you want fluorescent filter sets, and if so, which ones?

Answer:
No.  We anticipate installing our own filters, appropriate to the particular experiments being run.  Please note our requirement: "The capacity to switch between at least 3 reflectors/filters in the incident-light axis. At least one of these reflector/filter elements must be rapidly replaceable by the user."

Question:
6) What is the application? An explanation of the application would be very helpful.

Answer:
A typical experiment would involve:
? Introducing collimated laser light which would be focused by the objective lens onto the sample.  The sample would likely be a delicate fabricated micromechanical structure.
? Collecting the reflected light for subsequent analysis (for example involving comparing its phase to that of the incident light)
Simultaneously illuminating the sample with broadband light for visualization purposes

The due date for quotations remains unchanged.

Some of the technology available is very expensive. Answer 4: Currently there is no anti-counterfeit technology on our badges - the only requirement I can state is that it needs to be seen on the face of the badge from a normal meeting distance of about 3-4 feet, and be made so that if another company attem pted to counterfeit it, it would cause that company to expend significant resources (time and money) to produce a counterfeit replica of our new badge. All other terms and conditions remain the same.
