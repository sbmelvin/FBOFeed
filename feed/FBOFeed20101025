This contract will establish the CHIPRA Coordinating and Technical Assistance Center (CCTAC) to assist AHRQ in fulfilling the requirements for children’s health care quality measure improvement and development as specified in Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009.

In general, the work of the Contractor under this requirement will be responsive to priorities set by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as informed by a transparent process for multi-stakeholder engagement as required by CHIPRA.    

The Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP) will help enhance existing criteria for measure development to be responsive to the criteria specified in the CHIPRA legislation. CHIPRA requires measures that cover at least the following domains of quality: duration of enrollment and coverage for 12 months; services to promote healthy birth and to prevent premature birth; preventive services for children; treatment and management services to ameliorate the consequences of chronic and acute illness; family experiences of care; most integrated health care settings, and availability of services. The CCTAC shall have expertise in these areas of measure development as well as in cross-cutting areas such addressing racial/ethnic health care disparities and developing measures that are understandable to patients and families.

Specifically, the goals of the CCTAC are as follows:
1.	Assure coordination of efforts across the COEs/Grantee states;
2.	Assure timely flow of information between the COEs/Grantee states and AHRQ about PQMP activities and developments
3.	Provide technical assistance to the COEs/Grantee states;
4.	Further develop measure criteria, including requirements for documentation, and use the measure criteria to identify measures that are valid, feasible, and important for improving children’s health care quality and outcomes;
5.	Develop and implement a transparent process to recommend improved core sets of measures by January 1, 2013, January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014.  

It is anticipated that 1 contract will be awarded for a base period of 1 year with 3 one year options.  Award is expected on or about March 31, 2011.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and monitor the site for any subsequent amendments.  All qualified firms may submit a proposal which will be evaluated by AHRQ.  It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on or about November 9, 2010, with proposals due approximately 30 days thereafter.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in relation to the provision of Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Capability at Kabul International Airport (KAIA). 

NC3A has been authorized to use the Alliance Operations and Mission (AOM) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure.  The successful bid pursuant to this IFB will be that bid which is the lowest price technically compliant in accordance with the evaluation criteria. 

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time.  Bidders are advised that there will be a tentative bid validity period of 12 months from closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a Bid Guarantee tentatively set at Euro 100,000.  Should the selection and award procedure extend beyond 12 months after the Bid Closing Date, firms will be requested to extend the validity of their bids and Bid Guarantee accordingly.  Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid, and excuse themselves from the bidding without penalty.

The reference of the IFB is IFB-CO-13115-OPL and all correspondence concerning the IFB should reference this number. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

NC3A plans to place a single contract for the entire scope of work.  No partial bidding will be allowed.

The IFB package will be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Prospective bidders should be aware, however, that contractor personnel will be called on to work at a NATO site in conjunction with the contract and that such contractor personnel will be required to have security clearances to the level of NATO SECRET. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NC3A the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS

KAIA hosts the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Joint Command Headquarters and is central to ISAF operations and missions in Afghanistan.  KAIA has a role as the hub for lines of communications within theatre.  Given the importance of KAIA as an ISAF high value asset, the airport remains vulnerable to standoff insurgent attacks.  These attacks can come in the form of rocket, mortar, and small arms fire against personnel, facilities, and aircraft.  The loss of an aircraft, substantial infrastructure damage, or loss of life at KAIA has strategic implications as well as the potential to impeded missions within the ISAF area of operations.  KAIA is also an important Aerial Port of Debarkation providing the Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and Integration (RSOI) and Logistic functions that can be put at risk through enemy standoff attacks.

In response to the abovementioned threats, COM KAIA identified an urgent requirement for a Persistent ISR Capability at KAIA.  The capability will enable monitoring of the KAIA Ground Defense Area on a 24/7 basis by the Force Protection officers at KAIA North Operations Center (KANOC) in order to initiate and coordinate an appropriate response against identified threats and preserve the security of KAIA, its continued air operations, and personnel.

The Persistent ISR System will consist of long range daylight and infrared cameras, laser range finders, and laser pointers deployed on high masts and controlled via operator stations inside the KANOC facility.  Identical systems will be installed at two locations to be identified by COM KAIA and the Contractor according to operational, technical, and safety requirements.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States. 

U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.  The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

Using the contact information indicated on the DOE, the NATO contracting agency will contact the firm directly when the IFB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a DOE (and, for U.S. facilities not yet approved for NATO ICB, to submit a completed NATO ICB application): 17 November 2010

2. Anticipated date that NC3A will forward the IFB to those on the Bidders List: December 2010

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: February 2011

4. Anticipated contract award date: April 2011

<DESC><p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation to procure a Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) and/or modified COTS automated editing software that auto-denies Medicare health care claims across all claims types such as claims issued by hospitals, physicians, skilled nursing facilities, labs, ambulance companies, and durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers. CMS is only interested in engaging new application(s) that will be used by CMS and/or its contractors for denying improper claims before they are paid by the Medicare program (i.e., could be installed on a "prepayment" basis). CMS is NOT interested in software that identifies claims for human review, software that requires a comparison to a medical record or software that could only operate on a "postpayment" basis.<br /><br />This pre-solicitation notice is hereby posted in accordance with FAR 5.2. CMS reserves the right and anticipates making multiple IDIQ contract awards. The Government anticipates issuing task order 0001 to each IDIQ contract awardee for the performance of a field test. The results of the field test will be submitted to the Governement and used as an evaluation factor for the award of task order number 0002. The Government anticipates issuing a competitive RFP to all IDIQ contract holders for task order 0002 and anticipates awarding only one task order.<br /><br />The solicitation will be issued in accordance with FAR Part 15. CMS plans to issue the solicitation as a full and open competition.<br /><br />CMS anticipates making multiple IDIQ awards. CMS intends to use a multi-step acquisition process for this procurement to test automated edit products for completeness and accuracy through two required tests. The first test is considered small scale and requires vendors to submit answers to CMS to be assessed. The top qualified Vendors under the small scale test that provide the best overall solution will be awarded an IDIQ Contract and issued Task Order 0001 to perform a larger field test.</p>
<p>Under Task Order 0001, vendors will compete on the accuracy of their product(s) and technical capability to process millions of claims per day. CMS anticipates only making one award of the Automated Edit Module work under Task Order 0002. The IDIQ SOW includes all work awarded under this solicitation and anticipated future work such as implementation of Predictive Modeling for claims in a pre-pay mode.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> <br />Medicare is a multifaceted program. The Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) program consists of a number of payment systems, with a network of contractors that process over 1.2 billion claims each year, submitted by more than 1 million health care providers such as hospitals, physicians, skilled nursing facilities, labs, ambulance companies, and durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers. These contractors, called "Medicare Administrative contractors (MAC)," process claims, make payments to health care providers in accordance with Medicare regulations, and are responsible for educating providers about how to submit accurately coded claims that meet Medicare's medical necessity guidelines.<br /><br />Despite actions to prevent or recoup improper payments, it is impractical to prevent all improper payments. A January 2008 report by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) indicated that Medicare is among the top three Federal programs with improper payments, totaling an estimated $10.8 billion in 2007. <br /><br />Improper payments on claims can occur for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Payments are made for services that do not meet Medicare's medical necessity criteria.<br /><br />Payments are made for services that are incorrectly coded. <br />Other reasons, such as basing claim payments on outdated fee schedules, or the provider is paid twice because duplicate claims were submitted. <br />Medicare pays a claim that should have been paid by a different health insurance company (called Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) improper payments)<br /><br />There is growing concern that the Medicare Trust Funds may not be adequately protected against erroneous payment through current administrative procedures. Therefore, CMS is undertaking a project to determine if there are Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) software products that can automatically (without requiring human intervention) identify Medicare FFS claims for which payment should be denied.<br /><br /><br /><br />CMS is interested in a product(s) that:<br /><br />a. Only flag claims that can be auto-denied (i.e., do not require human review and are supported by clear policy). The term "clear policy" means a statute, regulation, National Coverage Determination (NCD), coverage provision in an interpretive manual, Local Coverage Determinations, or Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) article that specifies the circumstances under which an item/service will always be considered non-covered, incorrectly coded, or improperly billed; <br /><br />b. Never flags a claim that requires human review; <br /><br />c. Never flags a claim where the denial is not supported by clear policy; <br /><br />d. Accurately communicates what action should be taken on the flagged claim (full denial, partial denial, etc). In the case of a downcode, the product must indicate the new code to which the claim should be downcoded; <br /><br />e. Has the ability to mark each flagged claim with a Medicare-defined reason code; <br /><br />f. Has the ability to handle large volumes of claims (e.g. approximately 4.5 million claims per business day). <br /><br />g. Can provide an audit trail on actions taken on claims (denied on a specified date, etc) and that this information is available to authorized users via an interactive web-based application. <br /><br />h. Can provide statistical/workload reports such as number (and dollar value) of claims received from CMS in a given month, number (and dollar value) of full denials made that month, auto-deny rate (number of claims denied out of number of claims received), auto-deny dollar rate (dollars auto-denied per dollar claim paid and that these reports and statistics are available to authorized users via an interactive web-based application. <br /><br />i. Has the ability to turn off one or more edits within 1 hour of notification. <br /><br />j. Can edit across all claim types. If the product can only edit certain claim types please provide details. <br /><br />k. Can be modified to fit existing architectures. Describe if the product is adaptable to integration into existing environments such as an Enterprise Data Center or must the product run outside of the CMS environment; and, <br /><br />l. Can accept an input file from the CMS Common Working File and can submit a response file to the CMS Common working File in a CMS specified format. The layout of the input file and response file will be provided at a later date. <br /><br />In summation, CMS is seeking a single contractor who can provide automated editing software system (i.e., review claims without human intervention) across all claim types tailored to Medicare fee-for-service rules and policies for the best value possible. Award of the contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the offeror whose proposal and product best meets the government requirements. In order to meet government requirements CMS reserves the right to make a single award or multiple awards. In addition, CMS also reserves the right to amended or canceled the solicitation as necessary to meet CMS requirements.</p>

<a href="mailto:tim.costas@faa.gov">tim.costas@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides an update to the Terminal Automation Modernization Replacement (TAMR) Phase 3 program as announced in FAA TAMR Phase 3 Public Announcement in June 2010.
The FAA on September 15, 2010, made the following decisions to the TAMR3 program:
TAMR Phase 3 is structured into two segments.
Segment 1 - Approved an acquisition solution for an Agency December 2010 Final Investment Decision (FID) for the modernization of all seven (7) Terminal IIIE's Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACONs) facilities with Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) to support Automated Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) deployment; Replace remaining four (4) IIIE's previously modernized under TAMR Phase 2 with STARS; and continue New York TRACON (N90) upgrade to support ADS-B.  If the FAA approves the STARS acquisition solution in the December 2010 FID, the current STARS contract will be utilized to order the eleven (11) IIIE STARS systems.  This acquisition approach continues the FAA's strategic vision for convergence and elimination of multiple Terminal operational baselines and is consistent with the decision process for competing and awarding the STARS contract in 1996.
The seven IIIE TRACONs are:
	New York TRACON (N90)	Potomac TRACON (PCT), 	Atlanta TRACON (A80), 	Louisville TRACON (SDF), 	Dallas-Ft. Worth TRACON (D10), 	Northern California TRACON (NCT) 	Southern California TRACON (SCT). 
The four TAMR2 IIIE TRACONs are:
	Minneapolis (M98)	St. Louis (T75)	Chicago (C90)	Denver (D01)
Segment 2 - Continue TAMR Phase 3 investment activities addressing the modernization of the Terminal IIE facilities.  The FAA expects to approve an acquisition solution to support an Agency FID in the next eighteen (18) months.
The acquisition strategy for TAMR Phase 3 Segment 1 and Segment 2 will support further Automation convergence in support of the FAA's NextGen Implementation Plan dated March 2010.
The FAA will continue to gather industry comments through additional Request for Information (RFI) for Segment 2 and potentially EnRoute and Terminal automation convergence as the FAA finalizes its automation approach in support of NextGen.

<SUBJECT>Purchase of Lasers and accessories

<RESPDATE>110310
<CONTACT>Liem T Nguyen, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014358780, Email ln18x@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order, on a non-competitive basis, to SOLAMERE TECHNOLOGY GROUP, 1427 Perry, Salt Lake City, Utah 84103 for an upgrade to an existing Solamere Technology laser controller system.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items.

The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.  

The NINDS Cell Biology and Biophysics Unit (CBBU) conducts studies on the regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton and the defects in this regulation in neurodegenerative disorders.  To conduct any of these studies, the CBBU needs to observe in real time microtubule dynamics in vitro and in living cells, thus the need for the acquisition and integration of two additional laser lines compatible with the pre-existing customized laser system from Solamere Technology Group.  The Solamere laser base plate carries up to five (5) solid state lasers and can be combined with Gas Ion Lasers or another base to add ore lines.  The ability to combine solid state and gas lasers is a unique feature of the Solamere Technology laser system.
	
Special characteristics of the required system are as follows:

-	Mounting and combining (multi-laser merge) sets for lasers, 3 lasers, includes beam combining optics with cover for AOTF and optical path, integration with existing lasers and alignment (room for 5 solid state lasers, or combined gas and solid state lasers);
-	DPSS 488nm laser, 200 mW;
-	CUBE 640-100 CIRCULAR: 640 nm; 100 mW;
-	AOTF, 1 usec shutter, laser line selection and power control: 8 user programmable channels active, 400 – 700 nm;
-	Fiber optic set: custom laser to fiber coupler and armored single mode fiber optic, plus and alignment fiber;
-	Maintenance / consulting visit or additional training (routine visits Schedule 2 weeks in advance, urgent visits to be scheduled on a priority basis).

The optical system is enclosed within a removable steel cover allowing easy access to clean and align the combining optics.  The system uses an AOTF controlled laser line selection and power level control.  This means micro-second switch and shutter times between laser lines saving exposure to the specimen and adding speed to multi-color acquisition.  Those are characteristics that are essential for the CBBU’s fast single molecule TIRF experiments.  The electronic interface is designed with blanking inputs for use with Frame Transfer cameras (EMCCDs).  AOTF controlled Blanking during the Frame Transfer of the image eliminates the vertical streaking seen with EMCCD cameras.  Each AOTF channel (8 total) can be programmed by the user if it is decided to add or change a laser for future experiments.  The Solamere lasers can be run with Micro-manager.org, Meta-Morph, Piper, Elements software, and others.  The Solamere laser system is the only known system that allows control using the open source software µMicromanager.  The CBBU lab has multiple microscopes that use the µMicromanager software for their operation and their protocols for data acquisition have been optimized for use with this software. 

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Bethesda, MD, and is required within 30 days after receipt of order.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses submitted to ln18x@nih.gov  on or before 2:00 PM ET November 3, 2009.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the government to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please reference the announcement number NOI-1831375 on all correspondence.

<DESC><p>THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue Order 20XX, under Contract N00019-10-G-0006, to develop a multi-port reprogramming capability that simultaneously updates 3 to 4 Joint Standoff Weapons-Cs (JSOWs) missile software via the Common Munitions Bit/Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE). The subject contract will be issued to the Raytheon Company, Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ. The resultant Order will be Firm-Fixed-Price and will include Technical Data, Support Equipment and Other Direct Costs.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated herein, no formal request for proposal or additional written information is currently available. A determination by the Government not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis is published for information purposes only. (THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS). Under FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source, Raytheon is the only source who can fulfill unique hardware and software design elements that cannot be satisfied by commercial off the shelf components. Raytheon currently is supporting the JSOW program with all the associated manpower, equipment, certifications, software source code, and logistical processing. Raytheon has the knowledge, experience and access to the technical data necessary to fulfill the Government's need and meet its scheduled requirements. This Order is required in order to improve the Warfighter's readiness with a shorter strike preparation time and improve logistics by allowing parallel reprogramming of deployed assets which in turn greatly reduces adverse readiness impacts to ship operations.</p>
<p>Subcontracting opportunities should be sought directly from Raytheon. IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR INTERESTED PARTIES: There are no commitments by the Government to issue any solicitations, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the efforts mentioned above.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to solicit, on a sole source basis, for five-year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC), 6900 Main Street, Stratford, CT  06615-9129, for services in support of the modification of the MH-60 helicopter to incorporate Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures (OAMCM) capabilities.  The overall purpose of this effort is to:

1)	Develop modifications for the tow coupler in the MH-60 Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS)

2)	Develop, test, and evaluate the tow coupler AFCS modification

3)	Develop ECPs to incorporate AMCM capabilities into production aircraft, both forward fit and retrofit

4)	Develop, test, evaluate, and deliver AMCM production hardware and software

5)	Provide aircraft test pilots, ground maintenance crew, maintenance and flight test hours to conduct testing and evaluations

6)	Identify and purchase aircraft instrumentation required for testing

7)	Provide engineering, technical, and support services in support of AMCM system development, integration and testing

This proposed procurement is a follow-on contract for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, as defined in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).
 SAC is and has been the sole developer of the MH-60S Helicopter from the programâ€™s inception through the completion of the latest MH-60S IDIQ (Contract No. N61331-06-D-0012) which was awarded in fiscal year 2006.  There have been no other contractual actions related to the development of the MH-60S Helicopter awarded since this contract. Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to work through the complete development, test, and evaluation, SAC is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to complete the integration of OAMCM to the MH-60S Helicopter.
 The use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.

Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities with SAC should contact the company directly or visit their supplier website at http://www.utc.com/About+UTC/Suppliers+%2526+Partners.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for Navigation and Timekeeping Technology.
<p>In concert with the guidance promulgated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense National Information Infrastructure (ASD - NII), concerning Navigation Warfare(NAVWAR), which deals with the mitigation of denial of Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), this effort is concerned with the first two of the three elements: Electronic Protection (EP) and Electronic Support (ES). Please note that this effort does not address Electronic Attack (EA).</p>
<p>Precision navigation and timekeeping are essential for many modern naval and maritime systems, and it is essential that navigation and timekeeping services be made available to platforms and weapons at the highest level of accuracy and with the highest possible confidence at reasonable cost. Lack of precise navigation and timekeeping technologies may jeopardize the success of military operations. For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate position/time information at low cost and, due to this, GPS has become the technology of choice for many users. Unfortunately,<br />the GPS signal is a low-power signal that is susceptible to interference. Therefore there is a need for (1) affordable approaches to make GPS more reliable/robust, and (2) methods of quantifying threats to GPS performance that may be termed "situational awareness" and (3) affordable and reliable precision navigation/timing alternatives to GPS.</p>
<p>In the past nine years, ONR has been conducting a series of Science and Technology Projects in the following three technology areas; GPS Anti-Jam Technology, Precision Time and Time Transfer Technology, and Non-GPS Navigation Technology.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Background: In August 2010 the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) cancelled its requirement for Joint Multi-Mission Submersibles due to affordability concerns. However, USSOCOM continues to have a need for dry diver lock-out submersibles capable of conducting special operations. An opportunity exists to build on other successful commercial-to-military acquisition programs within USSOCOM by utilizing state-of-the-art commercial submersible technologies to produce a fleet of portable, reliable and affordable undersea vehicles that can meet USSOCOM's needs in this area. These vehicles would operate from surface support ships or submarines equipped with pressure-proof shelter systems either military or commercial, or future generations of the Dry Deck Shelter (DDS). Desired delivery dates of the first production units are 2015. To complete the study and consider programming initiatives in the fiscal year 2013 Program Objective Memorandum (POM), USSOCOM will be pursuing multiple preliminary designs and possibly prototypes.
<p><br />Description: This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) sets forth research and development areas of interest to USSOCOM Undersea Systems Program Management Office. It is issued pursuant to paragraph 6.102(d) (2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of white papers to satisfy USSOCOM technology pursuits.

<p>The general scope of effort commonly included to accomplish the technology pursuits include experiments and tests, feasibility studies, technology and producible evaluations, integrated technology evaluations, prototypes, operability, modeling, computational analysis, engineering and manufacturing development, and simulations. This includes the evaluation of innovative or unique configurations or use of commercial items and processes or concepts that are offered for further investigation for DOD applications. This announcement does not include technical, engineering, and other types of support services. USSOCOM will not accept classified white papers in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>Issuing Organization: This announcement is issued by USSOCOM, Headquarters Procurement Division (SORDAC-KW) on the behalf of the Program Executive Office Maritime, Undersea Systems Program Management Office PEO-M-U, 7701 Tampa Point Boulevard, MacDill AFB, Florida, 33621.</p>
<p>Requirements: USSOCOM is pursuing solutions for the design and construction of prototype of one-atmosphere Special Operations Dry Combat Submersibles of two different sizes, Light and Medium. The Dry Combat Submersible will be free swimming vehicle capable of delivering and extracting a team of combat swimmers. Common characteristics are: sustained top speed of at least 5 knots, maximum operating depth of at least 200 feet, provisions for two pilots (@ 325lbs counting their escape and evasion equipment), Classification by ABS as +A1 Submersible, air transportable in C-17 and C-5 aircraft, surface transportable in an ISO container (40 foot High Cube or smaller), and the following government furnished equipment (GFE): military radios, military sonars, high power Ag-Zn batteries.</p>
<p>Specific Characteristics:</p>
<p>Dry Combat Submersible Light:<br />Operable from a submarine with a lengthened &amp; modified Dry Deck Shelter (approximately 24 foot length overall)<br />Operable from specially configured commercial surface ships<br />Moderate passenger &amp; cargo capacity<br />Moderate endurance<br />2nd Production Unit Recurring Cost Goal (without GFE): TBD</p>

<p style="mso-outline-level: 1"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Description:</strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 3pt">This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for market research, budgetary and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="COLOR: black">The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) is interested in obtaining information from vendors and industry concerning technology products and systems that could be useful to GPO in meeting GPO's document composition and workflow tool capabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">GPO is seeking information about commercial composition engines that may meet GPO's requirements. The composition engine will be the tool that is used to compose all publications that are currently composed using MicroComp (e.g., the Congressional Record, Federal Register, Congressional Bills). This tool is not an authoring tool, but will accept already coded XML as input and output PostScript that can be distilled to PDF. Output will match the typographical and formatting style of the original publications. The engine will support the composition of all types of formatted content, including tables, footnotes, headings, columns of text, side notes, graphics, equations, continuation indicators, indexes, and table of contents.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">GPO is also seeking information about commercial workflow tools that may meet GPO's requirements. The workflow tool allows for automated and human-based tasks and actions to be defined, scheduled and executed. Workflows will be created by administrators and will have the capability to be customized to meet the GPO's needs for production processes, including pre-processing, composition processing, and post-processing. Workflows will be versioned and there can be as many variations on a workflow as GPO chooses to design. The workflow tool also has the capability to create audit trails and real time reports for system processes, and support workflow history management and reporting of individual user activity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p>The United States Government Printing Office's (GPO) current composition system is based on a 30-year old batch composition engine, developed and maintained by GPO, called Microcomp. Microcomp is currently used to compose the majority of Congressional documents and select Federal agency publications that are printed and published electronically by GPO.</p>
<p>Microcomp was originally designed to compose data files with typesetting-specific codes called locators. Locator codes are tied to external format files that specify style attributes to be applied to segments of content. Over the years, approximately 700 related applications and utilities (e.g., translation tools, delivery tools) have been developed to enhance and sustain the Microcomp composition process in response to the evolving needs of GPO's Congressional customers and changing in-house print and electronic access requirements. In response to Congress' adoption of XML as a data standard, GPO attempted to retrofit Microcomp to compose Standardized General Markup Language (SGML) / Extensible Markup Language (XML). Subsequently, Congress sought to improve workflow processes for content creators as well as search and retrieval of data by end users. As a near-term solution, the retrofitting of Microcomp was suspended and GPO decided instead to translate XML files into locator codes for printed publications. <a name="_Toc83702923"></a><a name="_Toc82415107"></a><a name="_Toc3703112"></a></p>
<p><span style="mso-bookmark: _Toc3703112"><span style="mso-bookmark: _Toc82415107"><span style="mso-bookmark: _Toc83702923">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="mso-bookmark: _Toc3703112"><span style="mso-bookmark: _Toc82415107"><span style="mso-bookmark: _Toc83702923">As a long-term strategic decision, GPO has decided to replace the system altogether, a project referred to herein as Composition System Replacement (CSR). The envisioned system will work within GPO's enterprise architecture (EA) as well as operating as a stand-alone application deployed remotely at customer sites. The system will be rules-based to facilitate the migration of content into future data tagging schemes/technologies while utilizing industry best practices. Output from CSR must match the typographic style and page layout of current printed publications. It must also be capable of generating output in data formats to support enhanced search and repurposing of data. It will interface with GPO's Federal Digital System (FDsys) for content submission and dissemination.</span></span></span><a name="_Toc3703113"></a></p>

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 3pt">This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for market research, budgetary and planning purposes only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is exploring search engine technology that could be used to replace the existing FAST Enterprise Search Platform used by the Federal Digital System (FDsys). The opportunity expressed in this RFI is referred to as Search Engine Refresh (SER) and the goal of SER is to identify candidate technologies that can be inserted with the least impact to FDsys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GPO has identified several high-level constraints which should be factored into any response to this RFI:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0pt" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; ">GPO has particular interest in search engine technology that is Linux based, and supports high availability and high performance indexing and search operations on very large volumes of structured (in XML) and unstructured enterprise content.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; ">GPO wishes to reuse as much of the current infrastructure to operate the replacement search engine as possible. This includes a cluster of Red Hat enterprise servers, and NetApp NAS and SAN storage.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; ">GPO seeks a replacement search engine that provides robust consistency of the documents it indexes and serves in response to search queries. Stability of the indexes and accuracy of the search results are the key characteristics desired by GPO.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; ">GPO is open to vendor-proprietary technology, as well as open source based solutions for this procurement. The terms of your product and your proposed product are used interchangeably in this RFI to refer to either category of the solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 36pt">The GPO is the Federal government's primary centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing, and preserving published U.S. Government information in all its forms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since its inception, under the authority of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO has offered Congress, the courts, and government agencies a set of centralized services that enables them to easily and cost effectively produce printed documents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>GPO has offered these publications for sale to the public and made them widely available for no fee through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP).</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 36pt">&nbsp;In January of 2009 GPO launched the Federal Digital System (FDsys) - a complex information management system delivering world-class search capability. The eventual scope of FDsys includes all known Federal Government documents within the scope of GPO's Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). This content is entered into the system and then authenticated and catalogued according to GPO metadata and document creation standards. Content currently includes text and associated graphics, but will also include video and sound and other forms of content that emerge.</p>
<p style="mso-outline-level: 1"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Opportunity</strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 3pt">GPO is seeking to better understand the technology roadmaps of possible solutions that can seamlessly replace the existing FDsys search engine.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 3pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Making your Capabilities Known - Requested Information:</strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 3pt">Vendors should furnish the following information (Word or PDF file) to GPO:</p>

This is not a request for proposal.  There will not be a solicitation issued at this time.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 22 - Network Contracting Activity (NCA), is conducting Market Survey for a possible requirement for award of a Construction Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).  The contract will award multiple Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ's) multi-trade construction contracts in support of the following Medical Centers: VA Long Beach Healthcare System, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, VA Loma Linda Healthcare System, and VA San Diego Healthcare System.  

The applicable NAICS code is 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Small Business size standard is $33.5 million in average annual receipts.  All contract work will be competed through task orders awarded for individual projects.  Each Task Order will be priced individually and will include its own wage determination.  These Task Orders will be competed amongst the IDIQ awardees.  The term of the IDIQ Multi-Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) may be a one-year Base Period from date of award, with four (4) one (1) year options to extend or one two-year Base Period from date of award, with three (3) one (1) year options to extend.  Each task order will have its own completion date established.  

This notice is published to conduct market research to determine if there is a sufficient number of certified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) capable of performing the requirements to warrant a solicitation set-aside.  It is strongly recommended that interested parties register in the US Department of Veterans Affairs VetBiz database.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/.   

Interested parties responding to this sources sought request shall submit the following information at a minimum: (1) company name, address and DUNS number, point of contact with email, phone number, and fax number; (2) documentation relating to capability of performance that demonstrates knowledge and experience performing construction activities in a functioning hospital/clinical environment (including references); (3) intentions of subcontracting program to include set-asides; (4) proof of registration in the VA VetBiz website or intention of registration prior to submission of offers to a future solicitation; (5) documentation on company's bonding capacity and limitations; and (6) any other pertinent company documentation. 

This market research is for informational and planning purposes only to determine if a SDVOSB set-aside for future requirements is appropriate.  The subsequent solicitation if any shall be 100% set-aside for SDVOSB if a favorable survey is received.  The Government will not pay any costs for responses submitted.  Only electronic submissions via e-mail in MS Word or PDF format will be accepted.  Submission must be e-mailed to Craig.Mach@va.gov before the deadline on November 24, 2010 at 2:00 PM PST.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />Continuation of the Dynamics of Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Research Study
<p>RFP No. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-150</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541712.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The purpose of this award is to acquire a "continuation" of services currently being performed by the University California, San Francisco (UCSF) under Contract N01-AG-6-2106).</p>
<p>The purpose of the HEALTH ABC Study is to characterize the extent of change in body composition in older men and women, identify clinical conditions accelerating these changes, and examine the health impact of these changes on strength, endurance, disability, and weight-related diseases of old age. The study population consists of 3,075 persons age 70-79 at baseline with about equal numbers of men and women. Thirty-three percent of the men are African-Americans as are 46% of the women. All persons in the study were selected to be free of disability in activities of daily living and free of functional limitation (defined as any difficulty walking a quarter of a mile or any difficulty walking up 10 steps without resting) at baseline.</p>
<p>The principal goals of the HEALTH ABC are:</p>
<p>To assess the association of baseline body weight, lean body mass, body fat, and bone mineral content, in relation to weight history, with:<br /><br />1. incident functional limitation <br />2. incidence and change in severity of weight- related health conditions <br />3. recovery of physical function after an acute event <br />4. baseline measures of strength, fitness and physical performance <br />5. gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status</p>
<p>&#61607; To access the contribution of episodes of severe acute illness in healthier older persons to changes in body weight, bone mineral content, lean body mass and body fat, and the relationship of these episodes to risk of functional limitation and recovery.<br /><br />&#61607; To assess the impact of weight-related co-morbid illness on the risk of functional limitation and recovery.<br /><br />&#61607; To assess the ways in which physiologic mediators of change in body composition influence and are influenced by changes in health in older adults and contribute to change in body composition; to understand how changes in body composition affect weight-related cardiovascular disease risk factors such as lipids, blood pressure and glucose tolerance.<br /><br />&#61607; To assess the interdependency of behavioral factors, such as nutrition and physical activity, co-morbid health conditions, and their association with change in body composition in old age.<br /><br />&bull; To provide a firm scientific basis for understanding issues related to weight recommendations in old age through increased knowledge of the potential trade-offs between weight and risk of functional limitation, disability, morbidity and death; to provide information critical for developing effective strategies for the maintenance of health in older persons.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>&bull; The intramural Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography and Biometry (LEDB) has supported the clinical research study entitled the Dynamics of Health, Aging and Body Composition (HEALTH ABC) since 1997. This study, targeted to understanding the decline in function of healthier older persons, complements research efforts in prevention of functional decline for healthy and frail older persons by focusing on the substantial majority of older persons in transition from vigor to frailty.<br /><br />&bull; The major objectives of the HEALTH ABC Study relate to observations that change in body composition in old age, particularly the increase in body fat and the decline in lean mass and bone mineral, represent a common pathway by which multiple diseases contribute to disability. There are many unanswered questions regarding the patterns and health impact of changes in weight and body composition in old age. Weight generally increases over the lifetime until late middle age, then tends to decrease into old age with changes in muscle, fat and bone. It has been postulated that the accelerated loss of muscle and strength in old age contributes to the onset of disability. Studies of weight and its relationship to mortality in older persons have yielded contradictory findings, leading to controversy regarding public health recommendations for weight in old age. Few studies have examined weight-related morbidity in old age, especially among African-Americans.</p>
<p>Primary study tasks include:</p>
<p>A. Support of data collection activities of the Field Centers for 6-month telephone interviews and disease and death outcomes adjudication.<br />B. Data management, maintenance, and distribution of data files for 6-month telephone interviews, disease and death outcomes adjudication, and select other sources of data such an ancillary studies.<br />C. Participation in and administration of the activities of the Diagnosis and Disease Ascertainment Committee.<br />D. Participation in and administration of the publications review process, including the review of analysis proposals and manuscripts. <br />E. Participate in the scientific direction and progress of Health ABC, including administration of the Ancillary Study proposal review process.<br />F. Maintenance of biologic specimen repositories, including genetic material. <br />G. Information Technology Security Requirements</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, background with change in body composition in older men and women, examination of the health impact of these changes on health and diseases of the old, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work, including access to the identified health study; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (2) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code; and, (3) any other information that may be helpful. Respondents must send two original copies via mail and one electronic copy via email; (4) responses should be received no later than November 1 , 2010 at 2:00 PM Local Time; (5) include respondents' technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses; and (6) send responses to this notice via email to csager@mail.nih.gov The original statements mailed using the U.S. Postal Service should be sent to ATTN: Craig Sager, National Institutes of Health, Office of Acquisitions - NIDA Neuroscience COAC, NIA R&amp;D Contracts Management Section, 6001 Executive Boulevard, Room 8154, MSC 9661, Bethesda, MD 20892-9661.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />Early Markers of Alzeheimer's Disease in BLSA Participants: Structural and Functional Brain Changes <br />RFP No. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-151
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541712.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Since 1958, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) has been a major research program conducted at the Gerontology Research Center (GRC) by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). The BLSA is a multi-discplinary study of physiologic and psychologic aspects of normal aging in community-dwelling men and women. Active BLSA participants are volunteers who visit the Intramural Research Program (IRP) in Baltimore, MD for testing every one to five years for 2 days. Since 1994, the program has been conducting a longitudinal brain imaging study of selected older adults in the BLSA to characterize individual differences in longitudinal brain changes, to investigate the extend to which these brain changes underlie individual differences in cognitive aging, to identify brain changes that may be predictors of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, and to assess the impact of potential modulators of brain and cognitive aging.</p>
<p>The work of this contract will continue to focus on the acquisition and analysis of neuroimaging data on BLSA participants. This project will continue to provide important information for researchers and clinicians on age changes in brain structure and function, their associations with cognitive change, and factors that modulate these associations, including risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The data to be collected will include assessments of brain structure, function, and amyloid deposition through MR imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and assessments of memory, other cognitive functions, and mood. Brain structure will be measured using MR volumetric brain imaging, FLAIR or other sequences that are sensitive to vascular abnormalities, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire the neuroimaging scans and shall provide sophisticated quantitative analysis of imaging data, including MR images collected during the initial contract period and new data during the continuation. The Contractor shall employ the refined methods for image analysis developed during the initial contract period, as well as new techniques developed as part of the proposed procurement. The Contractor shall be responsible for quantification of all PET data.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall also be responsible for contacting and scheduling the BLSA neuroimaging study participants, arranging transportation where needed, administration and monitoring of procedures during MR and PET imaging, and for administration and scoring of a neuropsychological battery, including assessments of functional status. The Contractor shall also provide a quiet space for neuropsychological testing in close proximity to the imaging facilities that is acceptable to the Project Officer. The Contractor must be located in close proximity to the NIA-IRP to facilitate repeated assessments of this unique population and to allow neuroimaging studies to be conducted in conjunction with regular BLSA visits.</p>
<p>Specific Tasks include:</p>
<p>Scheduling and Contacting Subjects: The Contractor will be provided with a list of names, telephone numbers, and addresses of eligible BLSA participants and shall be responsible for contacting and scheduling subjects. The Contractor must also provide lunch, parking and travel reimbursements (where necessary) in conjunction with imaging assessments.</p>
<p>Brief Medical Evaluation: In conjunction with the imaging assessment, the Contractor shall perform a brief medical screening, including determination of blood pressure and pulse, recording of changes in health history since last BLSA visit, and recording of current medications.</p>
<p>Imaging Procedures: State-of-the-art MR and PET image acquisition and analysis procedures are required for the performance of this contract. It is critical to the objectives of this project that comparable image acquisition and analysis procedures are maintained across subjects and years. An attempt shall be made to acquire images on the same scanner for all subjects and over time, where possible. However, it is recognized that over the duration of this contract modifications of the imaging procedures may be necessary to accommodate and take advantage of technical developments. The Contractor must advise the Project Officer of any modifications to the imaging procedures, and the initial and modified procedures must be approved by the Project Officer. Subcontracts of any part of this contract are also subject to the approval of the Project Officer.</p>
<p>PET Imaging: The Contractor shall be responsible for all aspects of the PET imaging including preparation and management of any regulatory procedures required prior to and during the conduct of the study. The Contractor should also demonstrate sufficient flexibility to allow modification of PET imaging ligands or procedures to take advantage of new approaches as they are shown to more accurate and more sensitive predictors of cognitive decline and transition to cognitive impairment and dementia.</p>
<p>Neuropsychological Testing:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for administration and scoring of a battery of neuropsychological tests to be given in conjunction with the neuroimaging evaluations. If the neuropsychological battery has been administered within the prior 3 months as part of a regular BLSA visit, the Contractor will not be required to repeat the neuropsychological testing. The neuropsychological battery shall include the following tests in the order specified: Fluent Production (FAS and Animal Naming, Boston Naming Test (Complete Version), WAIS-R Similarities Subtest, California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT), Clock Drawing, Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration Test (BIMC), Trails A and B, CVLT Delayed, BVRT Delayed, Card Rotations (Educational Testing Service), Mini-Mental Status Exam. In addition, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) shall be administered during participant waiting periods. The Contractor shall be responsible for follow-up assessments, including home visits, of any neuroimaging study participants who no longer return for BLSA and neuroimaging visits. The Project Officer or his designate will work closely with the Contractor, including training, supervision, and routine observations of assessments, to maintain consistency of the neuropsychological evaluations with the BLSA procedures. The Contractor or his designate will report to the Project Officer or his designate on a weekly basis to review BLSA subject participation and any procedural difficulties.</p>
<p>Replication, Dissemination or Use of Results. Data will be used by members of the LPC to examine the relation between changes in brain structure and function with normal aging and changes in neuropsychological performance. All data collected under this contract shall be forwarded to the LPC and a copy will be stored at the LPC. Results will be disseminated to the scientific community via presentations at scientific meetings and publications in professional journals. Collaboration of the Contractor principal and co-principal investigators with LPC Investigators in data analyses and reporting of study results will be encouraged.</p>
<p>Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a capability statement to include the following: (1) information regarding the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, background with acquiring the neuroimaging scans and sophisticated quantitative analysis of imaging data, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work, including access to the identified study; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information; (2) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code; and, (3) any other information that may be helpful.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award on a sole source basis a contract to Carter2 Systems, Inc., of Beaverton, Oregon for one hundred sixteen (116) non-human primate cages. JKT Development, Inc., is hereby granted authority to act on behalf of CDC for purchase of caging. The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR Part 6.302-1 in that Carter2 Systems, Inc., is the only known source with the knowledge required to provide these services/supplies. A few of the characteristics for the caging is as follows: Caging must be stainless steel; one-over-one compartment socialization caging that can be attached to other one-over-one units to allow primates to be housed in social groups. Small enough grating and other openings to allow the housing of smaller New World Primates without the risk of escape. Socialization panels are self storing with the ability to be locked. Caging has two feed openings, one for a feed box and the other for forage board attachment that comes with this caging unit.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Mission Support Division, Norfolk, VA is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Markey Machinery Company, Inc for the following requirement: Spooling of 0.322 electromechanical cable on the DESH-5 Research winch for the NOAA RONALD H. BROWN. Work is to be preformed at 7266 8th Avenue South, Seattle, Washington 98108. The statutory authority is 41 US 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. Requirement includes unspooling approximately 10,000 meters of 0.322 EM cable. Evaluate fit to existing Lebus Shell. Replace the Lebus Shell if required. Sand Blast and paint the winch drum. Evaluate new 0.322 EM cable and spool cable approximately 10,000 meters on the DESH-winch drum under tension. The winch capability has been critically degraded. The only method of replacing the EM cable in excess of 5,000 meters is to remove the winch spool and return it to the winch manufacturer (Markey). The new EM cable must be stress tested and the level wind of the winch reel must be modified to properly spool the EM cable under tension. The Lebus Shell on the winch drum must also be tested to ensure it is of the correct size to allow proper cable wrapping on the drum. If the EM cable is not spooled properly the operation of the winch and EM cable would be severely degraded. Only the winch manufacturer can provide the level of service needed to properly spool the Markey DESH-5 Research winch. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). The applicable NAICS code is 423830. Interested parties may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses shall be submitted by 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, November 8, 2010. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov. <br />
<p><strong>Justification</strong></p>
<p>The NOAA ship Ron Brown conducts global atmospheric and marine resource research supporting scientific studies world wide. The ship uses a Markey DESH-5 Research winch with over 7000 meters of multi-conductor electromechanical (EM) cable to perform her mission. The EM cable is used to attach a variety of sensors that determine the chemical make up of the local water from the surface to the bottom. The sensors are a major part of the foundation from which all observed maritime scientific studies are based. The winch system is considered mission critical. Its operation including the EM cable is essential to mission success.</p>
<p>The Forward Markey DESH-5 winch with 10,000 meters of 0.322 EM cable has failed in two (2) places during normal CTD operations, under average conditions. Two EM cable strands have broken. One strand is broken at ~4,000 meters of cable out, and another strand is broken at 1,348 meters of cable out. The EM cable is considered unreliable to deploy normally used heavy scientific equipment and must be replaced.</p>
<p>The winch capability has been critically degraded. The only method of replacing the EM cable in excess of 5000 meters is to remove the winch spool and return it to the winch manufacturer (Markey). The new EM cable must be stress tested and the level wind of the winch reel must be modified to properly spool the EM cable under tension. The Lebus Shell on the winch drum must also be tested to ensure it is of the correct size to allow proper cable wrapping on the drum. If the EM cable is not spooled properly the operation of the winch and EM cable would be severely degraded. Only the winch manufacturer can provide the level of service needed to properly spool the Markey DESH-5 Research winch.</p>

The Government intends to award a sole source purchase order for these requirements.  The suggested contractor is College of American Pathologists, a large business.<BR><BR>The College of American Pathologists (CAP) is the only vendor that has the mandated survey materials to maintain their accreditation and they have deemed status with the Joint Commission.  If the laboratory does not participate in these surveys, they would lose their accreditation and have to ceae all patient testing.  Even if another vendor did make like material, the laboratory could not them them because CAP will not accredit the lab using another vendors survey material.<BR><BR>This is not a request for proposal.  However, companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include complete and detailed technical specifications of their product, past performance information, price, and delivery time.  This information will be reviewed by the Government technical representatives for consideration for future requirements.<BR><BR>

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 532490 â€˜Other Commercial Machinery and Equipment Industrial Rental and Leasing.â€™  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-45 (Effective on 01 OCT 2010).

DESCRIPTION: The requirement is for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) type purchase order; Contract Line Item No.
 (CLIN) 0001 is for the rental of one (1) high pressure air compressor and one (1) Low Pressure Air Compressor for the period of performance 11/04/2010 â€“ 12/19/2010 for the USS SAN FRANCISCO (SSN-711).   Refer to Attachment (1) for the entire statement of work.
  
PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Packaging and preservation shall be performed in accordance with the best commercial practices to afford maximum protection against damage.

DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Item shall be priced at F.O.B. Destination and shall be delivered in accordance with the attached statement of work.  Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination by the Government.

52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:

(i)	  Technical capability of the item quoted to meet the Government requirement
(ii)	  Customer responsiveness
(iii)	  Price

Technical capability and customer responsiveness will both be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  A quote that is considered technically unacceptable or a quoter that is determined to have inadequate customer responsiveness shall be ineligible for award.  Customer responsiveness will be assessed based on past dealings between the quoter and the customer; Naval Submarine Base Point Loma.  If the quoter has never dealt with this customer before they will be considered to have adequate customer responsiveness for award purposes.
  Alternate customers apart from Naval Submarine Base Point Loma will not be surveyed to make a customer responsiveness determination.  The lowest priced quote that is determined to be technically acceptable and submitted by a company with acceptable customer responsiveness shall be selected for award.

(b) Options (not applicable).
 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the quoteâ€™s specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 

(d) Quoters shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. The price proposal shall state the unit cost and total price of the item required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above.

APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:
Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant.  Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make a quoter ineligible for award.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firearms range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training.  The range facility must be indoors; located in close proximity to a major trauma facility and within an hour drive to Romulus, Michigan.

Note:  This solicition is for an established range, not a solicitation to build a new range.

If ranges are not available, a Live Fire Shoot House can also be utilized for tactics/scenario training. The range must possess a minimum of ten (10) lanes.

The range must have targets, which simultaneously move back and forth as well as rotate. The range must be able to accommodate all handgun calibers as well as frangible ammunition for steel targets. The range rules cannot disallow movement between firing points or restrict movement-oriented firearms training firing points by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions). The range rules cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster. The range rules cannot disallow students from multiple and rapid-fire drills.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, (i.e. tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive). DHS employees are not authorized to sign a Hold Harmless Clause/Agreement. The range must possess a storage area dedicated to DHS firearms instructors and agents. The indoor range must possess a ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards.  The estimated days of range usage is 106 days per year at least 7 hours per day.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>5352.209-9001 POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (Oct 2010)</p>
<p>(a) There is potential organizational conflict of interest (see FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest) due to the nature of the work to be performed in Performance Work Statement paragraph 1.3.6, which requires the successful contractor to disseminate white papers and technical proposals submitted under the Broad Agency Announcement for the Information Institute. (The contractor will not be participating in evaluation of proposals.) Accordingly:</p>
<p>(1) Restrictions are needed to ensure that the contractor does not gain an unfair competitive advantage by requiring company-to-company agreements to (1) protect another company's information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it is considered proprietary by the other company and (2) to refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.</p>
<p>(c) The organizational conflict of interest clause included in this solicitation may be modified or deleted during negotiations.</p>
<p><br />5352.209-9000 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (Oct 2010) - ALTERNATE III (Oct 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The following restrictions and definitions apply to prevent conflicting roles which may bias the Contractor's judgment or objectivity, or to preclude the Contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions.</p>

<p>"Proprietary Information" means all information designated as proprietary in accordance with law and regulation, and held in confidence or disclosed under restriction to prevent uncontrolled distribution. Examples include limited or restricted data, trade secrets, sensitive financial information, and computer software; and may appear in cost and pricing data or involve classified information.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor may gain access to proprietary information of other companies during contract performance. The Contractor agrees to enter into company-to-company agreements to (1) protect another company's information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it is considered proprietary by the other company and (2) to refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished. For information purposes, the Contractor shall furnish copies of these agreements to the Contracting Officer. These agreements are not intended to protect information which is available to the Government or to the Contractor from other sources and furnished voluntarily without restriction.</p>
<p><br />5352.215-9000, Facility Clearance (May 1996)</p>

The Government agrees to determine (within 10 workdays) the validity and extent of the involved requirement and the method by which it shall be fulfilled (e.g., purchase, rental, lease, GFP, etc.). Facilities shall not be purchased under this SCR. Additionally, the Contractor (or authorized representative) shall not purchase, or otherwise furnish any base support requirement provided by this SCR (or authorize others to do so), without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer regarding the price, terms, and conditions of the proposed purchase, or approval of other arrangements.</p>
<p>(e) Following are installations where base support will be provided:</p>

The Contractor shall take all appropriate actions to notify their employee's of closure/delayed reporting and make alternate work/schedule arrangements, if necessary.</p>
<p>Facilities may remain open for contractor personnel during unscheduled federal closures (e.g., National Day of Mourning) or other instances where Government employees are granted administrative leave in non-emergency situations.</p>
<p>Compliance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-119 and Air Force Systems Security Instruction (AFSSI) 5027 is mandatory. It should be noted that such access requires, at a minimum, a National Agency Check or Entrance National Agency Check in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R, Personal Security Program. Contractors should make themselves familiar with local procedures for processing such requirements, and be prepared to be in compliance on the first day of contract performance. Failure to comply with this requirement may be considered a failure to perform.</p>
<p>Because of the nature and locations of the work performed, the value of such equipment is undeterminable. The Contractor shall not incur any cost resulting from nonsupport prior to Contracting Officer concurrence in accordance with this SCR.</p>
<p>(End of SCR)</p>

<DESC><strong>NOTE: This Request For Information has been updated as follows:<br /></strong><br /><strong>RESPONSE DUE DATE&nbsp;IS HEREBY EXTENDED&nbsp;TO&nbsp;1600 EASTERN TIME 2&nbsp;NOV 2010.<br /></strong><br />NOTE: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION&nbsp;HAS BEEN UPDATED<br /><br />Personnel Recovery Recapitalization Program (HH-60 Recap)
<p>Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request For Information (CRFI)</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION <br />The Air Force is in advanced planning to acquire a Personnel Recovery (PR) Recapitalization aircraft to replace the current United States Air Force (USAF) HH-60G fleet. The AF is only interested in full air vehicle systems solutions at this time. To assist in this planning, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), ASC/WISV, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of meeting the requirements of the approved Capability Development Document (CDD).</p>
<p>It is anticipated the United States Air Force will replace an estimated 112 HH-60G air vehicles. Contract award is anticipated to be in FY12. Meeting an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) by the end of FY15 is desired. FY15 IOC requires delivery of eight (8) aircraft with training systems and support in place (initial spares, support equipment, technical data). Describe the capabilities your solution can meet and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities. If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired. Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities; provide rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other technical information of potential solutions. <br /><br />This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS/CRFI. This SSS/CRFI is part of ongoing Government conducted market research for planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition approach. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts and non-disclosure agreements. The Government will determine whether its contractor team members have any organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The Government will not reply to information received. The Government anticipates conducting one-on-one discussions with respondents. For planning purposes, the Government is targeting November 2010 for these meetings.</p>
<p>PURPOSE <br />The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is to (1) update the responses to March 2010 Personnel Recovery Recapitalization Program (HH-60 Recap) Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (CRFI); (2) to engage industry a second time based on updated information; (3) to identify sources and capability that can meet a desired Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY15 if a contract award is made in FY12; and (4) to assist the Air Force in planning and ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with acquisition of the HH-60 Recap air vehicle. The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition approach. The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP. The Mission Profile, Standard Configuration Load (SCL) and Capabilities have been updated from the original March 2010 SSS/CRFI.<br /><br />RESPONSE GUIDANCE <br />Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that &lsquo;publicly-releasable' and &lsquo;proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>SSS/CRFI responses should include a Cover page containing identification of the company Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, street address, and large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone) designation for North American Industry Classification System (NACICS) code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical Point of Contact (POC) and the overall company POC (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company).</p>
<p>Responses are limited to 30 pages and must be received by 1300 Eastern Time 27 Oct 2010. Responses must be submitted via eight (8) hard copies with a CD copy in text searchable Portable Document Format (.pdf). Responses should be sent to the Contracting Officer, Jim Dinwoody, ASC/WISK, james.dinwoody@wpafb.af.mil, 1895 Fifth Street, Building 46, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7233.</p>

<DESC>2010 TARDEC Survivability Market Survey<BR><BR>OBJECTIVES:<BR><BR>US Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) is conducting a market survey to identify technologies that provides occupant protection and ground vehicle survivability.<BR><BR>The intent is to identify state of the art occupant protection and vehicle survivability systems through a self-assessment made by each respective participant. A system may be a single technology or a combination of technologies and must be minimally at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 (see Table I).<BR><BR>DESIRED CAPABILITIES<BR><BR>The Army seeks to enhance current and future Ground System survivability by providing threat detection, hit/kill prevention, and protection for the crew, passenger, and vehicle, while preserving vehicle payload, mobility, fuel efficiency, and Reliability, Availability, Maintainability-Durability (RAM-D) capabilities. Emphasis will be placed on survivability technologies that demonstrate the ability to be scalable, modular, and easily integrated onto a military vehicle. Affordability, minimal weight, and small space claim are key attributes. It is desired that the multiple technologies chosen will be integrated to provide a synergistic protective effect and not simply a cumulative effect of layering individual technology capabilities. The following are attributes the Army is seeking to include:<BR><BR>a. 360 hemispherical, lightweight crew and passenger compartment protection from armor piercing direct fire <BR>b. Lightweight crew and passenger compartment protection from blast events and fragmentation, including both side and underside threats<BR>c. Incoming threat detection and notification (i.e. sniper fire, RPGs, etc.)<BR>d. Survivability technologies to address Improvised Explosive Device or Explosive Ordnance Disposal (IED/EOD)<BR>e. Technologies to suppress/mitigate both internal and external vehicle fires.<BR>f. Non-Lethal technology that could be used for crowd control or to subdue individuals without causing permanent injury<BR>g. Safety applications to enhance crew survivability, including seat restraints, specialized seat configurations, rapid egress technologies, crew compartment coating to cushion soldier impact from vertical/lateral acceleration<BR>h. Soldier 360o hemispherical visualization during day and night operations and in all weather and environmental conditions (sand, dust, rain, etc.)<BR>i. Hazardous agent detection within operating environment<BR>j. Technologies that defend against RPGs, ATGMs, and/or EFPs<BR>k. Signature Management technologies or designs that reduce the thermal, acoustic, or RF signature of the vehicle system<BR>l. Other technologies that enhance crew, passenger, and system survivability, excluding automotive components that impact mobility and technologies used to aid tactical planning<BR><BR><BR>RESPONSES: <BR><BR>The submission period has been extended from 28 October 2010 to 12 November 2010. The Government will begin technology analysis following the submission period.

(NOTE: All non-security related questions should be sent to dami_tardecmarketsurvey@conus.army.mil.) Participation in this market survey is completely voluntary. If the Government seeks additional information that is not included in a submittal, TARDEC representatives may contact the participant for further information exchange. Information developed as part of this market survey will be shared with US Army Research, Development Engineering Command (RDECOM) subordinate commands, and Program Executive Office for Combat Support and Combat Service Support (PEO CS&CSS) Project Manager for Tactical Vehicles (PM TV), Project Manager for Future Tactical Systems (PM FTS) (Provisional), and Other Government Agencies (OGAs) (e.g.. Office of Naval Research, Marine Corps, etc.).<BR><BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION: <BR>The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term confidential in the context of Classified Information, we will use the term PROPRIETARY.] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <BR><BR>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) PROPRIETARY with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <BR><BR>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as PROPRIETARY may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR><BR>3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.<BR><BR>4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the PROPRIETARY legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS: and PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS.<BR><BR>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR>6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as PROPRIETARY will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.<BR>MISCELLANEOUS:<BR>No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking participants to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. A separate response for each system or technology is desired.<BR><BR><BR>Survivability Market Survey Questionnaire<BR><BR>1.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation to procure a Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) and/or modified COTS automated editing software that auto-denies Medicare health care claims across all claims types such as claims issued by hospitals, physicians, skilled nursing facilities, labs, ambulance companies, and durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers. CMS is only interested in engaging new application(s) that will be used by CMS and/or its contractors for denying improper claims before they are paid by the Medicare program (i.e., could be installed on a "prepayment" basis). CMS is NOT interested in software that identifies claims for human review, software that requires a comparison to a medical record or software that could only operate on a "postpayment" basis.<br /><br />This pre-solicitation notice is hereby posted in accordance with FAR 5.2. CMS reserves the right and anticipates making multiple IDIQ contract awards. The Government anticipates issuing task order 0001 to each IDIQ contract awardee for the performance of a field test. The results of the field test will be submitted to the Governement and used as an evaluation factor for the award of task order number 0002. The Government anticipates issuing a competitive RFP to all IDIQ contract holders for task order 0002 and anticipates awarding only one task order.<br /><br />The solicitation will be issued in accordance with FAR Part 15. CMS plans to issue the solicitation as a full and open competition.<br /><br />CMS anticipates making multiple IDIQ awards. CMS intends to use a multi-step acquisition process for this procurement to test automated edit products for completeness and accuracy through two required tests. The first test is considered small scale and requires vendors to submit answers to CMS to be assessed. The top qualified Vendors under the small scale test that provide the best overall solution will be awarded an IDIQ Contract and issued Task Order 0001 to perform a larger field test.</p>
<p>Under Task Order 0001, vendors will compete on the accuracy of their product(s) and technical capability to process millions of claims per day. CMS anticipates only making one award of the Automated Edit Module work under Task Order 0002. The IDIQ SOW includes all work awarded under this solicitation and anticipated future work such as implementation of Predictive Modeling for claims in a pre-pay mode.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> <br />Medicare is a multifaceted program. The Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) program consists of a number of payment systems, with a network of contractors that process over 1.2 billion claims each year, submitted by more than 1 million health care providers such as hospitals, physicians, skilled nursing facilities, labs, ambulance companies, and durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers. These contractors, called "Medicare Administrative contractors (MAC)," process claims, make payments to health care providers in accordance with Medicare regulations, and are responsible for educating providers about how to submit accurately coded claims that meet Medicare's medical necessity guidelines.<br /><br />Despite actions to prevent or recoup improper payments, it is impractical to prevent all improper payments. A January 2008 report by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) indicated that Medicare is among the top three Federal programs with improper payments, totaling an estimated $10.8 billion in 2007. <br /><br />Improper payments on claims can occur for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Payments are made for services that do not meet Medicare's medical necessity criteria.<br /><br />Payments are made for services that are incorrectly coded. <br />Other reasons, such as basing claim payments on outdated fee schedules, or the provider is paid twice because duplicate claims were submitted. <br />Medicare pays a claim that should have been paid by a different health insurance company (called Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) improper payments)<br /><br />There is growing concern that the Medicare Trust Funds may not be adequately protected against erroneous payment through current administrative procedures. Therefore, CMS is undertaking a project to determine if there are Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) software products that can automatically (without requiring human intervention) identify Medicare FFS claims for which payment should be denied.<br /><br /><br /><br />CMS is interested in a product(s) that:<br /><br />a. Only flag claims that can be auto-denied (i.e., do not require human review and are supported by clear policy). The term "clear policy" means a statute, regulation, National Coverage Determination (NCD), coverage provision in an interpretive manual, Local Coverage Determinations, or Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) article that specifies the circumstances under which an item/service will always be considered non-covered, incorrectly coded, or improperly billed; <br /><br />b. Never flags a claim that requires human review; <br /><br />c. Never flags a claim where the denial is not supported by clear policy; <br /><br />d. Accurately communicates what action should be taken on the flagged claim (full denial, partial denial, etc). In the case of a downcode, the product must indicate the new code to which the claim should be downcoded; <br /><br />e. Has the ability to mark each flagged claim with a Medicare-defined reason code; <br /><br />f. Has the ability to handle large volumes of claims (e.g. approximately 4.5 million claims per business day). <br /><br />g. Can provide an audit trail on actions taken on claims (denied on a specified date, etc) and that this information is available to authorized users via an interactive web-based application. <br /><br />h. Can provide statistical/workload reports such as number (and dollar value) of claims received from CMS in a given month, number (and dollar value) of full denials made that month, auto-deny rate (number of claims denied out of number of claims received), auto-deny dollar rate (dollars auto-denied per dollar claim paid and that these reports and statistics are available to authorized users via an interactive web-based application. <br /><br />i. Has the ability to turn off one or more edits within 1 hour of notification. <br /><br />j. Can edit across all claim types. If the product can only edit certain claim types please provide details. <br /><br />k. Can be modified to fit existing architectures. Describe if the product is adaptable to integration into existing environments such as an Enterprise Data Center or must the product run outside of the CMS environment; and, <br /><br />l. Can accept an input file from the CMS Common Working File and can submit a response file to the CMS Common working File in a CMS specified format. The layout of the input file and response file will be provided at a later date. <br /><br />In summation, CMS is seeking a single contractor who can provide automated editing software system (i.e., review claims without human intervention) across all claim types tailored to Medicare fee-for-service rules and policies for the best value possible. Award of the contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the offeror whose proposal and product best meets the government requirements. In order to meet government requirements CMS reserves the right to make a single award or multiple awards. In addition, CMS also reserves the right to amended or canceled the solicitation as necessary to meet CMS requirements.</p>

<DESC>THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: GNAS
Amendment A003 is issued October 25, 2010 to extend the date for receipt of proposals to 2:00 p.m. CST, November 10, 2010.  Further clarifications to the SIR/RFO are anticipated this week.
RE: Past Performance Surveys. In accordance with Section L, Provision L.1(f)(B), "Questionnaires with Part Two completed are to be submitted in a separate envelope and are not included with Attachment L.1 submittals."  Part Two is General Information, the FAA will distribute questionnaires to vendor references after receipt of proposals.  The "return by date" October 26, 2010 will be modified before the questionnaires are issued. 
10/21/10: It has come to my attention that three answers were not provided in the Questions and Answers posted on September 23, 2010.  Those Answers are provided today in the attachment titled "Answers 10-21-10".
Amendment A002 is issued September 23, 2010 to provide Vendor Questions with Answers and changes to the SIR/RFO.  Vendors should download attachments with an "A002" designation.
Amendment A001 is issued September 20, 2010 to extend the date for receipt of proposals to 2:00 p.m. CST, October 29, 2010.  A further amendment, along with Q&A, will be posted at a later date.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition and installation of Valve Regulated Lead Acid and Flooded Cell Batteries at FAA General National Air Space (GNAS) facilities with critical power and backup power requirements. 
Under these anticipated contracts, batteries and services will be provided to the FAA anywhere within the 48 contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Bahamas and Guam.  
The intent of the requirement is to acquire Commercial Off-The-Shelf/Non-Developmental Items (COTS/NDI) battery equipment.  Battery strings provide backup power to Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) and Direct Current Back-UP Systems (DC BUSs) during commercial power service interruptions.  
The vendors will furnish and deliver the batteries, remove and dispose existing batteries, install new batteries, and reinstall existing battery monitoring system, test new battery string and record baseline readings.  GNAS Battery String components include:  a. Battery String.  Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) battery or Flooded Cell Battery (FCB) having thirteen or more batteries.  The batteries are connected in series and referred to as a "Battery String".  Typical numbers of batteries per string are: 18, 24, 30, and 40 supplying 36, 48, 360 and 480 volts DC, respectively. b. Battery-to-battery connecting hardware.c. Battery tier-to-tier connecting hardware.
It is estimated that 192 battery strings will be replaced per year.
It is anticipated that up to four (4) Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity type contracts, with Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment, Time-and-Material and Cost-Reimbursement pricing arrangements, will be awarded covering these supplies and services.  The resultant contracts will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.
"Q&A Open period."  Questions regarding the solicitation and/or Statement of Work shall be provided electronically to the Contracting Officer (connie.m.houpt@faa.gov) prior to September 17, 2010.  Q&As will be posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities website.  
This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among small businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 335911-Storage Battery Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 500 employees.
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).  Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (October 29, 2010).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."
In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Complete submittals, both technical and cost proposals, must be received by the FAA, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, Friday, October 29, 2010.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
ELECTRONIC OFFERORS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED.
All deliveries; e.g. hand-delivery, overnight, etc., will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  10:00 a.m. delivery to the MMAC Screening Facility does not guarantee 2:00 p.m. delivery to the AMQ Customer Service Desk.  
Any responses received after 2:00 p.m. CST, October 29, 2010, will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the solicitation process.
The FAA reserves the right to no longer consider on this acquisition, firms which fail to respond, firms with respond incompletely, or firms which respond with any information found to be verifiably false.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this announcement.

 NSWCCD is seeking technically acceptable proposals from offerors interested in designing and manufacturing a carbon dioxide removal device using government-furnished Self-Assembling Mesoporous Monolayers (SAMMS)Material as the carbon dioxide absorbent.  Offerors will have access to schematics describing the construction of a technology demonstrator built using SAMMS by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  The awardee will manufacture an FA unit capable of qualification for use on a submarine. Delivery of the FA unit must be in accordance with the testing requirements outlined in the solicitation and is required to be delivered on or before 01 October 2012.  In addition to the FA unit, the contract awardee must furnish Technical Manuals and Provisioning Data which must meet the requirements set forth in performance specification provisions outlined in the solicitation.
 Interested parties may obtain samples of SAMMS carbon dioxide sorbent and technical drawings of the TRL 6 unit by contacting Ms. Jane DeMatto at Phone No. (215) 897-7994 or via e-mail at: jane.dematto@navy.mil.  Requests for material samples must be received no later than 1700 EDT on 19 November 2010.

The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract and shall be awarded on a best value basis. This procurement shall be solicited using unrestricted competition. The NAICS classification for this acquisition is 332710 with a size standard of 500 employees. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on 10 November 2010 and close thirty (30) days thereafter. All interested parties may download the solicitation and any amendments at the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at: https://www.neco.navy.mil/  at the approximate date listed for release of the solicitation.

E.5  52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
 
   (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
 
 Technical Capability
 Past Performance
 Price
 
 Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than price.
 
   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
 
   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 
                            (End of Provision)

1.  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL

Management Capabilities & Approach 
Corporate experience of Offeror's officers and employees, manner in which vendor would intend to accomplish contractual obligations for start-up and phase-in schedule, management plans and procedures for logistical and administrative support of all functions; i.e., Contractor training or personnel.
  (i)  Proposed method/system of patient orientation and written instruction to cover the operation of oxygen equipment.
(ii)  Quality control procedures to be used to ensure all contractual requirements are met.
(iii)  Offeror to provide descriptive literature on the oxygen equipment he/she intends to provide beneficiaries.  The failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may require rejection of the offer.
(iv)  Copy of customer satisfaction data for the last three years including methodology and action plan if areas to improve were identified.

Quality of Offeror's Facility
Demonstrate compliance with specifications related to personnel, locations, and capability to meet time requirements. 
  (i)  Evidence of qualified personnel to service this contract (including copies of licenses)
 (ii)  Offeror's technical expertise and knowledge of equipment.  
(iii)  Years of experience providing services. 
(iv)  Availability of labor force or plan for recruiting. 
 (v) Describe base of operations (home office) and satellites (if any) to service all AREAS.  If the Offeror does not currently have an office or required satellites in the catchments, a comprehensive plan for the acquisition of resources (e.g. space, equipment, personnel, etc.) needs to be outlined including an implementation date no later than 15 days prior to the start of the contract. 

Education/Training

For all personnel performing services under the contract, submit a resume, educational background, knowledge/skills, experience, training certificates, license(s) from each state, three (3) personnel references, continuing education taken and relative importance to the services they will be providing.  Describe proposed training program for educating the patient and home care provider for the home oxygen equipment.

2.  PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
	Past Performance
Identify all Federal, State, and local government contracts and private contracts of similar scope, size, and complexity that are ongoing, or have been completed within the last three (3) years, or in the alternative to "contracts", indicate nature of past performance in the regular conduct of business.  Provide a list of three (3) references pertaining to those contracts including name, address, contact person, and telephone number.  Include information that depicts contract compliance, financial stability and efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

3.  COST PROPOSAL
	Price & Related Price Items
The Government reserves the right to make award on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions.  Therefore, the initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint.  The Government will award a single contract contingent upon best value and the Offeror's ability to meet all requirements. 

Evaluation of the Technical Proposal
"Outstanding"            O	 Very significantly exceeds most or all solicitation requirements.  Response exceeds a "Better" rating.  The     offeror has clear demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirement to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.

"Better"	 B                     	Fully meets all solicitation requirements and significantly exceeds many of the solicitation requirements.  Response exceeds an "Acceptable" rating.  The areas in which the Offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.

"Acceptable"               A	Meets all solicitation requirements. Complete, comprehensive and exemplifies an understanding of the   scope and depth of the task requirements as well as the Offeror's understanding of the government's requirements.




"Marginal" 	      	M
Less than acceptable.  "There are some deficiencies   in the  technical proposal.  However, given the opportunity for discussions, the technical proposal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least "Acceptable."  (Areas of a technical proposal which remain to be "Marginal" after "Best and Final" offers shall not be subject to further discussion or revision.)  If award is made on initial offers, there will not be an opportunity for discussions, nor a chance to become at least "Acceptable."

"Unacceptable"           U	Technical proposal has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions: Failure to understand much of the scope of work necessary to per-Form the required tasks; failure to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Government's requirements; failure to meet to meet many personnel requirements of the solicitation. (When applying this adjective to the technical proposal as a whole, the technical proposal must be so unacceptable in one or more areas that it would have to be significantly revised to attempt to
					make it other than unacceptable.)

Evaluation of Past Performance
Scoring Adjective:  The following adjectives should be used as general guidance in assessing the Offeror's past performance.  This evaluation is separate and distinct from the Contracting Officer's responsibility determination.  The assessment of the Offeror's past performance will be used to evaluate the relative capability of the Offeror and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP:
Contracting Officers will use the following adjectival definitions as guidelines in evaluating past performance:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

OUTSTANDING:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable) based upon Offeror's past performance.

BETTER: Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance of lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable) based upon the Offeror's past performance.
SATISFACTORY:  Some potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable) based upon the Offeror's past performance.

MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the Offeror's past performance.  (A rating of marginal does not by itself make the proposal ineligible for award.)

METHOD OF AWARD:  Award will be made to the Offeror(s) whose overall offer is the most advantageous to the Government, both technical, past performance and price being considered.  The Offeror with the lowest cost alone will not necessarily be awarded the contract.

CONTRACT AWARD:  The award will be on a firm fixed price contract.  After receipt of proposals, a determination shall be made of which proposals are in the competitive range for the purpose of conducting written and/or oral discussions, if necessary.  Offerors should note that award may be made on initial proposals.

POST-AWARD CONFERENCE:  A post-award conference will be held at a time and place designated by the Contracting Officer, to be attended by the contractor, Chief of FMS, Contracting Officer and other officials as designated by the Contracting Officer.  At a minimum, the conference agenda will include: performance requirements, training requirements and schedules, government furnished property/services/procedures/forms/reports, and quality assurance. 

PERIOD FOR ACCEPTANCE OF OFFERS
The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.

8.	When on station and/or on-call at the John D. Dingell VA Medical Center, Detroit, the contractor shall perform all sacramental services for Catholic patients.
9.	 When on station and/or on-call at the John D. Dingell VA Medical Center, Detroit, the contractor shall conduct morning prayer.
