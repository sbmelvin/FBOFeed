STATEMENT OF WORK
HU25 PRE-COOLER P/N 69003-800-3
REPAIR/RE-CORE
19 JUN 04


CONTENTS:
1.0	INTRODUCTION
2.0	BACKGROUND
3.0	SCOPE
4.0	TECHNICAL INFORMATION
5.0	PAST PERFORMANCE
6.0	QUALITY ASSURANCE PROVISIONS
7.0	  MARKING, PACKAGING AND PRESERVATION




1.0	INTRODUCTION: This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the tasks for the repair and/or re-core of HU-25 pre-cooler p/n 69003-800-3.

2.0	BACKGROUND: The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty-three HU-25       
        aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-  
        Avions Marcel. HU-25 pre-cooler p/n 69003-800-3, manufactured by Jaeger of 
        France, provides precooled bleed air for the CSD air/fluid heat exchanger. These   
        components are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation   
        Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). 

3.0	SCOPE: This SOW establishes the requirements for the repair and/or re-core of HU-25 pre-cooler p/n 69003-800-3. The contractor shall be a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center and have experience in repairing similar or like items.  The contractor shall provide all necessary labor, tooling, fixtures, parts, materials, test equipment and facilities to inspect, repair and/or overhaul this component to meet current functional performance and test specifications designated by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Jaeger of France. All offerors who have not submitted a repair specification to the U.S.C.G. shall do so.

The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair. First, a “return to service” repair is considered as test/inspect/repair as necessary. This work consists of inspection, failure analyses, defective part(s) replacement if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements in the most economical method. Second, “re-core” would be required for units that do not meet OEM minimum tolerances or show excessive degradation.

3.1	CMM

The OEM has not distributed a CMM. All repairs/re-cores shall be accomplished In Accordance With (IAW) the offeror’s  detailed work specifications package.
       
3.2	Serial numbers have been identified in the CLIN information. Exclusions and cannibalization clauses do not apply. Items covered in this contract which are received by the contractor missing consumable components are not considered to be cannibalized.

3.3	Items requiring repair/overhaul to the extent the total cost to repair exceeds    65% of the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) new replacement cost, will be considered as beyond economical repair (B.E.R.) In the event the contractor considers a component listed in the contract to be beyond economical repair, he shall contact the Contracting Officer, in writing, for disposition instructions. The letter shall identify the item number, P/N, and a breakdown of the price for parts and labor necessary to repair the component. Contractor shall not proceed with repair until authorization (or  disposition) is received from the Contracting Officer.


4.0	TECHNICAL INFORMATION:

The Coast Guard does not possess nor own the technical specifications for this component. All offerors who have not previously developed and provided a detailed work specifications package to the Coast Guard for Pre-cooler repair/re-core shall be required to do so to be considered for this solicitation.

5.0	PAST PERFORMANCE
 
            5.1    Provide documentation for having performed repair/re-core of similar or like         
         items.

5.2	Provide points of contact for past performance documentation. Include the   
         Reference’s name, company, phone number and e-mail address.				
6.0	QUALITY ASSURANCE PROVISIONS:

6.1	The contractor shall provide and maintain a quality system in compliance
with ISO 9001 or ISO 9002, ANSI/ASQC Q9001, Q9002 or a Quality System that is acceptable to the government.


7.0	MARKING, PACKAGING AND PRESERVATION:

7.1	The contractor shall comply with ASTM D 3951-98 (11/10/98), Commercial Packaging, Shipping and Storage Procedures.

7.2	Each individual container shall be labeled on the outside with National Stock   Number, part number, serial number (if applicable), quantity, nomenclature, contract number, and line item number.
7.3	The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling and storage.  Preservation protection must be sufficient to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period not less then one year.
7.4	Packaging matter shall not consist of the following materials: popcorn, shredded paper, Styrofoam or any type of peanut packaging.
7.5	Bar coding is authorized but not mandatory.
7.6	Only when an AOG situation occurs, the outside of the shipping container will be marked in highly visible lettering “A.O.G”.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in a negotiated procurement for the acquisition of a Visitor Ticketing and Tracking System for the Presidential Libraries.

A solution is sought which will provide accurate data collection and will support ease of analysis of that data for the growing Presidential Library System.  Furthermore, the solution should also provide for efficient maintenance of the system which includes compatibility with systems already in place at the JFK Presidential Library and the George H. Bush Presidential Library and an ASP link the Presidential Library Headquarters in College Park, MD.  Finally, as part of an overall effort to improve customer service and satisfaction, there is a 15 month window for system wide implementation.  The following Libraries will require installation: William Clinton Library, Ronald Reagan Library, Lyndon B. Johnson Library, Gerald Ford Library, Jimmy Carter Library, Harry S. Truman Library, Herbert Hoover Library, Dwight D. Eisenhower Library, and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library. The contract awarded as a result of this RFP will be a Firm-Fixed Price supply contract with Department of Labor wage determinations incorporated, as necessary.

<DESC>Cochiti Mesa Fuel Break, Jemez Ranger District, Santa Fe National Forest. This fuelbreak is being constructed to reduce the fire hazard surrounding the community of Cochiti and to construct a strategic point of defense where fire fighters can work safely in the event of a wildfire.  When the work is completed the forest within the project area will be open and spacing will be irregular to create a natural appearance.  The largest, healthiest trees will be left with an average of 20-feet between the tree crowns (spacing may range from 10-30 feet) and an average of 25-feet between groups of trees (spacing may range from 20-30 feet).  The appearance of the forest will be irregular, with large healthy trees dominating the landscape and a lesser representation of smaller, healthy trees so that multiple size and age classes are represented. Due to the proximity and alignment with homes, all slash will be treated at the time of fuelbreak construction.  Slash less than 5” in diameter must be removed or chipped or otherwise masticated on site.  Material greater than or equal to 5” in diameter may be either removed or remain on site for public firewood collection.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute on behalf of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, with McKesson BioServices, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, for a modification to add work related to an existing research and development Contract N01-AT-28603 entitled “Research-Grade Cranberry Product Development.”  McKesson BioServices, Inc., has developed, as contracted, four well-characterized products:  cranberry beverage and a matching placebo beverage, as well as a cranberry powder and matching placebo powder.  NIH-sponsored grantees who responded to an RFA are required to use the products developed by the Contractor.  The grantees expect delivery of products Summer 2004.  These grantees require larger quantities of product than originally required in the Contract.  The increased grantee needs result in increased production, increased storage, increased handling, more frequent shipping, the need for an inventory control system, and more complex labeling of individual containers.  Therefore, a determination to use other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as set forth by FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Illinois Education Association-NEA (IEA-NEA) is the only known state professional education association to have designed a statewide curriculum with an interactive and developmentally appropriate educational program for teachers which will enable them to provide their students with the following: fundamental science concepts of severe weather, severe weather safety precautions and how to undertake appropriate preparedness actions.   

There are several advantages to having staff from a state education association design a curriculum: 
•	The association staff knows both the national and state science standards.
•	The association staff has an available clientele of member teachers and can communicate with them to both beta test the product and to distribute the final product.
•	The association staff can evaluate the product after initial beta testing. 
•	The association staff can encourage the state teachers to use the product.

IEA is a professional association of 120,000 members composed of Illinois elementary and secondary teachers, higher education faculty and staff, educational support professionals, retired educators and college students preparing to become teachers.  The staff of the organization works to meet the needs of its teacher members in a number of ways.  One of the important functions of an association is to provide for professional development opportunities and the Xtreme Weather curriculum project began as a professional development opportunity.  

The project began when staff from IEA-NEA worked with several meteorologists from the Lincoln, Illinois, National Weather Service Forecast Office to develop a project that could help teachers to better understand the science concepts in meteorology.  IEA staff asked local NOAA employees to help identify the necessary weather information that every middle school teacher needs.  As the body of science information was delivered from weather forecasters, the staff from IEA-NEA worked to align the NOAA-provided weather information with the state science standards.  

This requirement will complete an existing rough draft of a CD-ROM and ultimately it will provide 500 middle school teachers with the science information by way of an interactive CD-ROM, an accompanying Teacher Workbook and the technical training required to utilize these resources.  

This sole source vendor has the necessary expertise to handle the educational aspects of the project and to make the educational aspects conform to the science standards.  All teachers in the United States must have their classroom work aligned to these science standards.

Offeror's who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response from acknowledged entities as having expertise and a high level of competency in the field.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis.

All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the address contained at the header or faxed to 301-713-0806 or 0808/09 to the attention of G. Jean Hairston and Solicitation No. DG1330-04-RQ-0150(GJH).

Previous sources sought was published in FEDBUSOPPS on 21 May 2004, entitled "MUE Phase B Sources Sought Synopsis." To assist in the assessment of MUE Phase B, portions of the previous synopsis has been extracted.  MUE is part of the overall GPS Modernization effort (Space/Control/User Segment). The Modernization upgrades will result in the addition of several new Civil Signals as well as a new military signal and security architecture.  The MUE Program is the User Segment component of the GPS Modernization program and is to validate that user equipment can be developed that effectively interoperate and exploit the capabilities of the modernized constellation. The MUE Program is nearing completion of Phase A.  This phase consist of government development and assessment of MUE, technical requirements, alternative acquisition strategies and preliminary cost estimates.  Some of the contract tasks included contractor assessment of key technical and design issues relate to security architecture, receiver design, and the inclusion of multiple signal processing, YMCA.  In addition, four (4) PRDA contracts were awarded to reduce program risk.  Contractors awarded these efforts follow:  Raytheon Company, El Segundo, CA; Rockwell Collins, Inc., Cedar Rapid, IA; Interstate Electronics Corporation, Anaheim, CA; and Trimble Navigation Limited, Sunnyvale, CA. The MUE Phase B program is a development program with the objective of demonstrating Y-code/M-code/Course Acquisition-code (CA)-(YMCA) receiving and processing capability using the Protection of Navigation (PRONAV) Security Architecture.  The MUE Program is not a production program and will not directly result in the procurement of MUE under the anticipated Phase B contract effort.  The primary products of the development will be validated Government controlled, non-proprietary, specifications (specs) and Interface Control documents (ICDS) for the GPS Receiver Application Module Standard Electronic Module type E Modernized (GRAM-S/M) receiver card and Ground-Based GPS Receiver Application Module-Modernized Small Serial Interface (SSI) (GB-GRAM-M SSI) receiver card.  For additional information, see previous synopsis. This synopsis modifies previous announcements as follows: 1) Potential offerors must currently have the ability to process, maintain and store Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) no later than release of Request for Proposal (RFP). The current projected date for release is November 2004. All potential offerors must respond to this change. Send statements of interest with sufficient information to verify this requirement to Ms Iris Green at 310-363-3731 or e-mail: Iris.Green@losangeles.af.mil.  2) The Government plans to eliminate the GPS engine concept from the MUE Phase B Program.  No other changes are projected at this time.  However, the government is actively seeking other acquisition options that result in multiple awards.  In the event the government determines multiple awards are feasible, changes in the MUE Phase B effort and approach will be provided in a subsequent announcement. The government anticipates releasing draft sections of MUE data on or about 22 June 2004, to solicit comments from Industry.  This information can be obtained through the GPS Bidders Library.  Parties interested shall apply at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary where they must provide adequate justification for access, and all contact information inclusive of email address.  In addition, the government intends to hold an Industry Day on Wednesday, 14 July 2004 at The Aerospace Corporation, Bldg A-8 Conference Room, 2350 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, CA starting 800 hours Pacific Time.  Once the briefings have concluded on 14 July (and 15 July), the government will hold one-on-ones with potential sources wishing to meet with the government.  Parties interested in attending Industry Day and/or meeting with the government shall contact Lt John Holt at 310-363-3631 or e-mail: john.holt@losangeles.af.mil for further instructions. This synopsis is for planning purposes only any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  Additional questions to the Government may be included under separate cover, the government reserves the right to not respond to all questions but will make an effort to respond to questions.  All questions will be considered in future program planning efforts.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does its issuance restrict the government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the request.

<RESPDATE>062904
<CONTACT>Cynthia Gill, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-757-5218, Fax 301-757-5284, Email Cynthia.Gill@navy.mil
<DESC>MOD: This is amendment 001 to the synopsis/solicitation N00019-04-R-0148 for procurement of an extended cargo rail system for the V-22 that originally appeared in the CBD on Thursday May 27, 2004.  The purpose of this amendment is to notify potential offerors of an extension to the original proposal due date of 22 June 2004 to 29 June 2004.    

ORIGINAL: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number N00019-04-R-0148 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The incorporated document and provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22 & 23 effective 5 May 2004.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded.  This is not a small business set-aside.  The applicable NAICS code is 336413.  The contract line item numbers are:  CLIN  0001  Extended Cargo Rail System for V-22 (Qty: 2 shipsets).  Development, fabrication, and delivery of two ship sets of an Extended Cargo Rail system for test and evaluation.  Drawing packages of the ramp attachment channel will be provided upon request.  Options:  CLIN 0002: - drawings, CLIN 0003:  2 ship sets of external cargo rails (for testing).  Non-developmental (NDI) equipment is highly desired.  1)  General Requirements:  a)  The cargo rails are mission equipment and will be carried in the aircraft.  No stowage provisions are required.  b)  The cargo rails should mount to the aircraft ramp using a means similar to that of the H-46 cargo system (drawings provided upon request).  c)  Designs shall not require Group A changes (e.g. aircraft attachment locations and methods, aircraft structural load paths).  d)  The system shall be capable of carrying up to 5,000 lbs over an 88-inch running length.  e)  Special attention shall be given to minimize the weight, need for hand tools, handling requirements of the system. f)  Workmanship shall be in accordance with high-grade aircraft practice and of quality to insure maximum safety, proper operations, and design service life.  2)  Basic Roller Rail Extension Requirements:  Extensions shall have the capability of accepting a wooden warehouse pallet loaded on non-contiguous runner boards.  a) The spacing between individual rollers shall take into account the actual versus nominal non-contiguous runner spacing for typical 40x48 wooden warehouse pallets.  A four-inch center to center would be preferred.  b)  Extensions shall be manufactured from lightweight material capable of holding up to 5000 lbs of cargo spread over a running length of 88 inches or 2500 lbs spread over the non-contiguous runners of the 40x48 pallet.  c)  Extensions roller material shall provide smooth movement of the pallet load with minimal amount of human force to push the pallet in the event the winch is unavailable.  Roller material and type that are current installed on the V-22’s new cargo handling system (Aircraft 19 and subsequent) are preferred (aluminum crown barrel bearing rollers).  d)  The extensions shall integrate a fully adjustable “flip-up” style pallet guides.  Minimally the adjustment, per side should be a 7 –inch adjustment in 1-inch increments.  Total adjustability is from 40 inches to 54 inches wide.  e)  Extensions shall be stabilized with the use of  “spreader” type bars, which, when locked in place, restrict movement laterally.  Spreader bar locations shall allow for an 88-inch long pallet to be loaded with a forklift directly onto the extensions without interference of the bars on the forklift tines.  The “spreader” type bars shall be integral to the rails to reduce the opportunity for lost equipment.  f)  Removable ramp interface brackets with a design similar to those of the H-46 system shall be used in the design of the rail system.  Upon attachment into the V-22 ramp, the extensions shall lock in place for positive restriction of movement in all directions.  g)  The extensions shall be nineteen feet in length.  3)  Specific Roller Rail Extension Requirements:  a)  Cargo Ramp Roller Rail Extensions shall utilize interlocking means to prevent misalignment of attachment to the ramp.  b)  Mechanical Lock Pins can be used (although not desired) where necessary to minimize the need for hand tools, special tools or procedures.  c)  Since the extensions will be used in an austere environment the ability to quickly disengage extensions from the ramp is also desired.  d)  Each extension shall provide three tiedown ring locations, one forward, one aft and one approximately mid-span, for fastening of the beam to the aircraft floor during flight.  e)  All labeling of installation locations shall be etched and painted.  Labeling of spreader bar adjustment locations should be provided to ensure concordance with ramp mounting locations.  4)  Priced Options:- a)  Priced option for drawings  b)  Priced option for 2 ship sets of external cargo rails (for testing).

Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  Technical capability will be determined on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this provision.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the Offeror to provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc. in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposal.  The Offeror shall provide backup information verifying the price offered, e.g. a copy of the current catalog, three invoices for the same equipment, etc.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror with the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  This constitutes Amendment 0002 to N00178-04-Q-1006.  This amendment is issued to revise the Statement of Work.  NON-LETHAL OC/MALODORANT SPLASH DELIVERY ROUND Design / Fabrication (SOW).  The following testing requirements have been added to this effort:  1. Conduct tests for government sponsor to demonstrate that design goals have been met. 2. Conduct tests for the government sponsor to demonstrate a side-by-s ide comparison of the round penetration performance in ballistic gelatin compared to a typical 12-gauge bean bag round.  3. Perform a set of demonstration tests to show the capability of this new round to a set of prospective end users.   The tests for the government sponsor will include the following: 1) Tests with inert rounds to determine round impact velocity, accuracy, and imparted momentum (or impulse).  The impact conditions will be determined for three different standoffs (20, 50, and 75 yards).  There shall be a minimum of five tests conducted at each standoff.  2) Tests with inert rounds to compare round penetration in ballistic gelatin to a typical 12 gauge bean bag round at a standoff of 20 yards.  There shall be a minimum of five tests with both the inert round and the bean bag round.  3) Tests with live rounds to determine ability to penetrate two routes of entry  (a double-paned window and a hollow core door) and disperse the non-lethal payload inside.  There shall be a minimum of five tests for each route of entry at standoffs of both 50 and 75 yards.  These dispersion tests shall use a 10x10x8 foot or larger building with both a double-paned window and a hollow core door.  The building must also have a ventilation fan that is capable of producing at least four air changes per hour.  High-speed video (3,000 – 10,000 frames/second) will be used to capture the images of round as it disperses the payload.  After the tests for the government sponsor have been completed, a subset of those tests will be selected for inclusion in the demonstration tests for the prospective end users.  The demonstration tests will include accuracy demonstration tests with a minimum of five inert rounds, a penetration demonstration with one shot each of an iner t round and a bean bag round into ballistic gelatin, and at least two payload dispersion tests into the building with live rounds.  Each proposal should provide a complete cost breakout providing the basis for the price.  Three current/verifiable references should be included in the proposal. Simplified Procedures will be utilized.  All items are to be priced FOB Destination.

<DESC>MODIFICATION:  The sources sought dated 17 Jun 04 is modified to include the following:  DCC-W is seeking capabilities from firms to determine levels of competition and subcontracting goals.  Firms capability statement should be as complete a package  as possible by specifying services/products that can be provided and including your resource capabilities as well.  Capability package should demonstrate firm's ability to perform the specific tasks that are being requested in the Statement of Work.  In a ddition, the Government will evaluate proposals and make a Trade-Off/Best Value selection in accordance with following criteria (in descending order of relative importance): Factor 1:  Demonstrate technical understanding of work and capabilities for perfor ming tasks and services and providing data as identified in the SOW.  Discuss management plan, tasks performances, methodology and technology components, and time frames for completion of work.  Factor 2:  Demonstrated ability to provide required data for up to 500 continental US locations within the delivery times of the SOW and for the required time period.   Identify Project Team and demonstrate sufficient, qualified personnel and other resources (provide resumes), staffing time allocations, subcontracti ng arrangements, etc., to demonstrate or support the contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s ability to provide the required data.  Factor 3:  FirmÃ¢Â€Â™s prior experience and performance in providing similar services/data to those identified in the SOW.  Factor 4:  Price --- A lthough price is a substantial consideration, it is less important than technical considerations and ability to provide the data with-in the given time constraints and with the correct time period.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when com bined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  The response time and date remains unchanged.

<DESC>Standand Form(SF) 330 for Architect-Engineer Qualifications became effective 8 June 2004, and replaces SFs254/255. The form has two parts: Part I - Contract-Specific Qualifications, and Part II - General Qualifications.  Although there has been a sli ght delay in the implementation, firms interested in the electronic submission of a Standard Form 330 part II will soon be able to submit it to the Business Partner Network (BPN) at www.bpn.gov. For a logon and password, firms will use their DUNS number an d the Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) they selected when registering on the CCR web site, www.ccr.gov. Part II is prepared on a branch office basis, which aligns with the assignment of DUNS Numbers.  Submission of the SF330 Part II to the BPN is voluntary.  However, it will increase a firm's visibility in the Federal marketplace and may lead to opportunitie s for contracts that are exempt from public announcement. Do not submit a SF 254 or a SF 330 Part II to the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS).  ACASS will be modernized in late 2004 to retrieve the SF 330 Part II data from BPN and make it available to contracting agencies.  Until t hen, agencies will require A-E firms to submit Part II with Part I when responding to a solicitation of A-E services.  A Part II is required for each branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract.   After ACASS is modernized, contracting agencies have the option of requesting firms submit Part II with Part I or retrieving Part II from ACASS if a firm has one on file in BPN. You may direct any policy questions on the SF 330 Part II to Marilyn Nedell at the ACASS Center at (503) 808-4590, or by email at Marilyn.B.Nedell@usace.army.mil.  Use the help feature on BPN for general questions about the use of BPN.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) intend to contract with the Department of Marine Sciences, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill to construct a physical oceanographic circulation model. The model will be used to model drifter tracks for comparison to observed drifter tracks. Satellite-traced drifters were release on five occasions in Gray’s Reef National Marine Sanctuary: April 2000, June 2000, October 2000, January 2001, and March 2001. A total of 15 drifters were released. Drifter positions were determined by Service ARGOS for approximately 60 days from the time of release. Raw location data was provided to the Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research (CCFHR) and processed into 6 hourly intervals. These processed data files will serve as the observed drifter tracks. Particles are to be released in the physical circulation model domain at the location and time of the actual drifter release (n-15). The model is to be forced by modeled and/or observed wind fields and tides derived using standard oceanographic modeling methods. Tracks of the modeled drifters are to be calculated for the same duration of the actual drifter tracks. The contractual obligations will be fulfilled with the submission of a report. To develop the coupled biological-physical model first will be combined observed drifter tracks with modeled particle tracks, which are derived from a physical circulation model. The minimum requirements for the physical oceanographic model include: 1) the model is integrated into a currently operating Ocean Observing System; 2) that the model domain include Gray’s Reef NMS; 3) that the model be a fully three-dimensional physical circulation model forced by winds and tides; and 4) that the model have a fine scale shelf domain (~5 km) that increases in spatial resolution closer to the coast (~1 km resolution). The model will then be used to compare observed drifter trajectories with modeled drifter trajectories.  The Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Chapel Hill is the only contractor the government knows that has developed and is operating a physical circulation model that meets the requirements. The government knows of no other qualified source. The intended procurement is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of  41USC253©(1). Any business sources able to provide the specific service referenced, are encouraged to respond to this announcement within 15 days after it’s publication. Interested firms should submit in writing, their name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding their capability and qualifications to provide this service. This information should be fax to 816-426-7530 Attn: Sharon Walker. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time.  This acquisition is being conducted pursuant to the guidelines set forth in FAR Part 13. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no qualified responses are received, the Government intends to contract with the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for the referenced service. This is not a small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 541690.

<DESC>This is a Nationwide (all 50 states including Alaska and Hawaii) sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) that can provide assistance in closing out expired Federal Government Contracts, Task Orders, Delivery Orders and Simplified Acquisitions throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) including all regional offices and Operating Divisions (OPDIV’s).  The DHHS has ten (10) regions as follows: Region I - serving Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.  Region II - serving New York , New Jersey, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands.  Region III - serving Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and District of Columbia.  Region IV - serving Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.  Region V -  serving Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Region VI - serving Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.  Region VII - serving Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.  Region VIII - serving Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming.  Region IX - serving Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Guam, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and American Samoa and Region X - serving Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.  The following OPDIVS are located throughout the regions listed above.  Administration for Children and Families (ACF); Administration on Aging (AoA); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); Food and Drug Administration (FDA);  Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA); Indian Health Service (IHS); National Institutes of Health (NIH); Program Support Center (PSC) and  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Offices that have closeout activity are mainly within the Washington, DC area, but are also located throughout the United States.  As the principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing critical and essential human services, the HHS has embarked on a major initiative in support of HHS Secretary Thompson’s goals and the President’s Management Agenda in a “one” Department wide challenge.  This overall involves bringing together diverse activities which will result in coordinated systems for managing programs.  Directing a concerted effort to standardize various components within the department is essential in achieving the “one” Department goal.  Specifically for this sources sought, we intend to achieve standardization in the acquisition arena within each OPDIV is of particular interest which entails consistent approaches to various acquisition policies and procedures.  This standardization provides for a unified front across the department and also allows for increased efficiency and reduced overhead.  In an effort to initiate some of these processes, senior management officials and other representatives from each OPDIV of HHS met and collectively designed a set of proposed actions for acquisition consolidation.  More specifically, the focus of this sources sought is on   the “closeout function” within the acquisition cycle. The closeout function, while required as part of contract administration, is often an overlooked activity because considerable time and resources are devoted to awarding contracts, rather than closing them out.  Thus a backlog of expired contracts can easily develop as a result of the resource distribution devoted to the award phase and other administrative activities.  The Department currently has approximately 29,000 files that need to be properly closed out.  They include Firm Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, Cost Reimbursement /Task Order, Fixed-Price/Task Order, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Cost Plus Award Fee, Time-Material/Task Orders, Simplified Acquisition, Delivery Order (FSS/IDIQ), Fixed-Price SBIR Phase 1.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541661 with a size standard of $6m.  This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via email to bhartley@psc.gov. Your capability statements should not exceed five (5) pages in length.  CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE EXPERIENCE IN CLOSING OUT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, TASK ORDERS, DELIVERY ORDERS AND SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS. All capability statements MUST provide supporting documentation along with the following: 1) company name, 2) address, 3) point of contact, 4) phone/fax/email, 5) NAICS Codes, 6) business size and status (e.g., small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business) 7) provide a listing of services your company provides related to the Federal Contract Close Out experience; 8) list previous Government experience addressing your successes and contract information.  Lastly, indicate whether or not your firm has a Federal Supply Schedule for these services along with providing the Federal Supply Schedule number.  Responses are requested not later than April 30.  Capability statements will not be accepted after the due date.

[NOTE: The exception for a color display is for the provision of a physical color monitor only. The ECS software must provide support for a color display, including addressing the requirements of section 9 for clear visibility in the conditions of light normally experienced on a vessel by day and by night, and the additional display-related requirements in sections 9.1.1 thru 9.1.4 and 10.]  The system shall be capable of displaying Automatic Identification System (AIS) data fed into the laptop from a Class A Universal shipborne AIS meeting International Standard IEC 61993-2 via an RS232 serial connection.  The ECS software shall, at a minimum, be capable of displaying the AIS messages 1,2,3,5,18, and 19 described in International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation ITU-R M.1371-1.  The ECS software shall be capable of creating routes from a series of Waypoint Location (WPL) sentences defined in National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) 0183 standard.  These WPL sentences will be contained in an ASCII file stored on removable media supported by the laptop.  The ECS software shall be capable of creating Search and Rescue (SAR) routes (i.e. patterns) given user defined input such as:  type of search, starting point, track spacing, and direction of first turn.  These and other SAR parameters are defined in IAMSAR, International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual: http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-o/g-opr/manuals.htm - IAMSAR. The ECS software shall have the capability to export comma-delineated data required for marking Aids To Navigation (ATON).  The ECS software shall provide the capability for users to mark and update position information for ATON, and the capability to update basic attribute data (e.g., time, position, fix quality, Horizontal Delusion of Precision (HDOP), depth, buoy type, buoy color, river gauge, river stage, pool elevation) required for electronic charting of ATON data.  This information also supports production of Inland Electronic Navigation Charts (IENC) and distribution of Short Range Aids to Navigation (SRAN) data updates for use with IENCs.  The ECS software shall support the following ECS Databases:  (1) 
Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) produced by National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in IHO S-57 format, currently distributed by MAPTECH under contract to the Coast Guard or available via NOAA website; (2) Inland ENC produced by the Army Corps of Engineers in IHO S-57 format (according to the IENC Content Specification modifying the "best-fit" of S-57 object and attribute classes as necessary to describe river information). For further information see: http://www.tec.army.mil/echarts/inlandnav/. [NOTE: This Content Specification differs from the Product Specification for Inland ECDIS issued as Appendix B to the UN Economic Commission for Europe Inland ECDIS Standard.]; (3) Raster Navigational Chart (RNC) currently produced by MAPTECH in BSB format according to IHO S-61 and MAPTECH product specification versions 3 and 5, and distributed under contract to the Coast Guard; and (4) RNC ECS Databases produced by the UKHO in HCRF according to IHO S-61 and distributed through the Admiralty Raster Chart Service (ARCS).

<DESC>This is not an RFP, but a survey to locate potential sources capable of performing the proposed work.  It is anticipated that a Contractor will be required for an effort to investigate various seismic and related multi-hazard technical issues as they are identified by FEMA, develop technical design and construction guidance products, and support the dissemination of these products and related outreach efforts based on these products.  These voluntary resource guidance products present criteria for the design, construction, upgrade, and function of buildings subject to earthquake ground motions in order to minimize the hazard to life for all buildings, increase the expected performance of higher occupancy structures, and improve the capability of essential facilities to function during and after earthquakes anywhere in the United States.  FEMA has had considerable success in attracting some of the best earthquake engineers and scientists to assist in the development of these FEMA resource products.  Because of this, our products have been widely used by practicing design professionals and building officials, and the techniques and technologies contained in these products are being incorporated into national model building codes and consensus and industry standards.  The objective of this proposed contract will be to establish a process for the contracting of specific tasks to support the investigation of seismic and related multi-hazard technical issues as they are identified by FEMA, the development and publication of technical design and construction guidance products to address those issues, the dissemination of those products, and support of training and related outreach activities based on those products to the various user groups who need that information.  The specific tasks shall be identified by FEMA with input from the Contractor and various outside sources.  Minimum capabilities must include documented evidence of experience and expertise in all of the following areas: 
1) Demonstrated experience in the investigation and documentation of seismic and multi-hazard technical issues as identified both in the enforcement of seismic building codes and in the investigation of post-earthquake building performance, and of related earthquake ground motion generated hazards, such tsunami; 2) Demonstrated experience in working with researchers and research programs in addressing advanced seismic and seismic-related technical issues, such as soil-structure interaction; 3) Demonstrated capability of enlisting the services of nationally recognized seismic design and construction experts experienced in the development of technical guidance products, including structural engineering, civil engineering, architecture, earth science, geo-technical, construction, code development and enforcement, public policy, and academic researchers; 4) Demonstrated experience in the development of other seismic and multi-hazard technical design and construction resource guidance documents and other related products; and 5) Demonstrated experience in the development of training materials and marketing/outreach programs that promote the use seismic and multi-hazard technical design and construction guidance products.  Each of these requirements shall be rated equally.  Firms with these capabilities are invited to submit complete information to the procuring office identified in this notice in three (3) copies within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice.  Information furnished should include: 1) the number and professional qualifications of scientists, engineers, technical, and other appropriate personnel; 2) company experiences related to the proposed project; 3) a description of general and special facilities; 4) a current financial statement; and 5) other literature which demonstrates minimum capabilities listed above.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  Based upon responses received, the Government reserves the right to set aside any and all procurements that may result hereunder for small or minority-owned businesses.  If the evaluation of responses received concludes that none of the responding firms have the necessary capabilities, negotiations may be conducted with the Applied Technology Council on a noncompetitive basis.

<RESPDATE>070704
<ARCHDATE>09052004
<CONTACT>xinia llovetzurinaga, 508 233 4146
<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential contractors that could fulfill the following requirement. The US Army Tank & Automotive-A rmaments Command (TACOM), Clothing and Heraldry Product Support Integration Directorate has a requirement for a study to determine a valid and easily executable method to calculate the replacement factors found in Section I to III in SB 10-496. The Army Su pply Bulletin SB 10-496 can be found in the Natick Contracting Division web page at https://www3.natick.army.mil under Business Opportunities/Upcoming Acquisitions/W911QY-04-R-XLZ6/Files available for download. The Clothing and Heraldry PSID, TACOM, has th e responsibility to update replacement factors annually.  However, replacement factors have not been updated since 1997 because the Clothing and Heraldry PSID no longer has the resources and expertise to calculate new replacement factors.   A replacement f actor is the estimated percentage of clothing and equipment in use that will need to be replaced each month due to wear and tear, enemy action, pilferage, abandonment, and other causes except separation of personnel from services. Replacement factors are c alculated for three environmental conditions (tropical, temperate, and arctic) and for training.  For example, a replacement factor of .056 would mean that for every 1,000 items in use, an estimated 56 items would need to be replaced every month. Replaceme nt factors are used to calculate Army War Reserve requirements for clothing and textiles and also to calculate the cost to introduce new clothing bag items, among other uses.  Small changes in replacement factors could potentially have a very large funding  impact. Additional information on the definition and use of replacement factors is found in Chapter 1 of SB 10-496. Replacement factors have historically been calculated using the demand data of similar items.  However, historical demand data will not ref lect the changes in materials and manufacturing processes used in new items.  Demand data analysis, which is primarily based on peacetime consumption, also suffers from the difficulty of defining the correct size of the population of users. The method sele cted to calculate replacement factors will be based on the proven validity of the results and the resources needed to gather the data and perform the calculations. The Government is looking for future contractors that would develop and validate a process t o calculate replacement factors, not to calculate them. For purposes of this acquisition, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 and the small business definition is not to exceed $23,000,000. Firms responding to this syno psis must submit white papers to include in general terms: how the company proposes to calculate replacement factors and validate the results and/or indicate previous work or studies that indicate some expertise in this area. It should also include an esti mate of the cost and time needed to complete the project. Firms should also include company name, address, point of contact and size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS).  This is not a request for proposal and in  no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  Responses to this notice can be mailed, faxed or e-mailed to the attention of Xinia Llovet-Zurinaga, US Army RDEC Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA 01760.  Fax number is 508 -233-5286 and e-mail is Xinia.Llovet-Zurinaga@natick.army.mil . Telephone responses will not be accepted.  For technical questions related to this announcement please call Mr. Gregory Schech at 215-737-2500. White papers must be received no later than 3:00  PM EST on 7 July 2004.  This notice is to help TACOM, Clothing and Heraldry Product Support Integration Directorate, in determining if there are potential sour ces for this potential future acquisition.  All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their responses to this notice are not a request to be considered for a contract award.  If a solicitation is used, it will be announced separat ely from the responses to this announcement.

<SUBJECT>--STANDARD FORM 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS
<DESC>Standard Form (SF) 330 for Architect-Engineer Qualifications is effective 8 June 2004, and replaces SFs 254 and 255.  The form has two parts: Part I, Contract-Specific Qualifications, and Part II, General Qualifications.  Part II of the form can now to submitted electronically to the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  ORCA is part of the Federal-wide Business Partner Network (BPN) and can be found at http://www.bpn.gov/.  Click on VENDOR under ORCA on the left side of the screen to submit your information. The SF 330 Part II is Question 26 in ORCA; the preceding questions must also be answered.  Firms must first have a DUNS Number and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system.  (CCR can be also be ac cessed from the BPN website.)  Firms will also need their Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) generated from CCR to access ORCA.  The information submitted through ORCA is available, in a read-only format, to the public.  Part II is prepared on a branch office basis, which aligns with the assignment of DUNS Numbers.  Submission of the SF 330 Part II to ORCA is voluntary.  However, it will increase a firms visibility in the Federal marketplace and may lead to opportunities for contracts that are e xempt from public announcement.  The information submitted to ORCA is available to the public.  Do not submit a SF 254 or a SF 330 Part II to the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS).  ACASS will be modernized in late 2004 to r etrieve the SF 330 Part II data from ORCA and make it available to contracting agencies.  Until then, agencies will typically require A-E firms to submit Parts II with Part I when responding to a solicitation of A-E services.  A Part II is required for eac h branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract.  After ACASS is modernized, contracting agencies have the option of requesting firms submit Part II with Part I or retrieving Part II from ACASS if  a firm has one on file in ORCA.  You may direct any policy questions on the SF 330 Part II to Marilyn Nedell at the ACASS Center at 503-808-4590, or by e-mail at caic.nwp@nwp01.usace.army.mil.   Use the Help feature on ORCA for general questions about the  use of ORCA.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.
Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The primary North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541330, which has a small business size standard of $4 million in average annual receipts over the previous three fiscal years. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence for the required work. Contracts may be negotiated and awarded up to one year after completion of the selection process. The government contemplates the award of one to three possible multiple Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts resulting from this competition. Tasks may be directed based on the location and qualifications of the firms. Initial contract period will be for one year and the government may, at its option, extend the contract to maximum of five years by exercising each of the four one year renewal options. Work under each of the contracts will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. Firms selected are guaranteed a minimum of $3000.00 in fees for base year. There is no guaranteed minimum for the option years, if exercised. The amount awarded in fees for each year of the contract (base year and each option year, if exercised) will not exceed a maximum of $250,000.00.
Task orders will be awarded primarily for small projects for which the cost of construction is expected to range between $5000.00 and $80,000.00. Each task order will be awarded as a firm fixed-price contract based upon the successful negotiation of the contractor’s cost proposal and time of completion for the services requested.
