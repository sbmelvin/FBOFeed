<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number 1435-01-02-RP-70771; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).   GovWorks, on behalf the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), AFR/SD/ED (Bureau for Africa, Office of Sustainable Development, Education Division) intends to competitively award multiple contracts  (one each for east, west and southern Africa) for technical services to implement a girls' scholarship and mentoring program on a regional basis throughout sub-Saharan Africa.  The Education Division, AFR/SD receives proposals to implement educational and mentoring programs throughout sub-Saharan Africa in connection with realizing girls' scholarship program objectives: to provide rural, needy girls with an opportunity for access to higher levels of quality education, particularly in fields relevant to the needs of their communities; and, to mentor girls into economically viable careers and meaningful lives. The primary objective of the Ambassador Girls Scholarship Program is to help females stay in school. The scholarship program covers the costs of tuition, uniforms, transportation, and any associated fees. The scholarships are awarded to girls at the primary and secondary levels to encourage them to stay in school, complete their education, and broaden their economic opportunities. Girls receiving the scholarships have mentors to promote self-development and set examples of the contributions that women can make to a society. There has been a significant bridging of the gender gap through the advancement of female education through these activities.  Former efforts of AGSP have helped countries mobilize resources to educate girls and women to foster educational development in 35 African countries.   The objective of the Ambassadors' Girls' Scholarship component under this Initiative is to enable disadvantaged girls and young women to pursue their education and to gain valuable life skills through such activities as career camps, mentoring, Take Your Daughters to Work, orientation to the use and application of information and communications technology, internships and related skill-building activities. The underlying principle is that girls are the ultimate beneficiaries of the program and that communities will gain from the benefits of having sent their daughters to school. Therefore, community buy-in/ ownership of this educational support model is critical to its sustainability. Local NGOs will be expected to advocate for sustainability at the local level, and report on results. In addition, the Africa Education Initiative (AEI) requires visibility and management of the overall function of the program to ensure that broader initiatives specific to AEI are being met.  The contractor management process must be proactive based on up-front planning and agreements reached with AFR/SD/Education, defined and monitored performance and cost milestones, frequent progress reports to AFR/SD/Education and timely identification and resolution of potential problems. The contractor is expected to perform all necessary administrative services to successfully implement and maintain tailored AGSP programs for countries designated by key decision-makers of the AFR/SD/Education Office.  These functions will provide the foundation for performance by an independent evaluator of formative and summative evaluation of individual programs.  To this end, services are to include, but may not be limited to: 1. Scholarship and Mentoring Program Management, 2. Scholarship Tracking System, 3.  NGO Capacity Building, 4. Design and Maintenance of a Program Web Page, 5.  Workforce Skills CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The total estimated value of this effort is $8,000,000 for the base period (2 years) and approximately $4,000,000 for each option year.

The Statement of Work for this effort is as follows:  Program Management and Technical Support for the Ambassadors' Girls' Scholarship Program (GSP) INTRODUCTION The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), AFR/SD/ED (Bureau for Africa, Office of Sustainable Development, Education Division) has a requirement for the technical services to implement a girls' scholarship and mentoring program on a regional basis throughout sub-Saharan Africa. II.	BACKGROUND  	The scholarship program has been operational in the following countries: Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. 	Continued successful implementation of the program in 35 countries is measured by the enhanced ability of African institutions to address local education and democracy challenges including higher education levels for girls and women, more informed citizens participating in democracies, and broader access to information and communication technology.  Program components are catalytic in nature, brokering new alliances and embedding innovative technologies 	LONG-TERM STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 	The primary objective for AGSP is to strengthen girls' access to educational opportunities within African countries.  Recognizing that girls are often not allowed to complete their education for various reasons and thereby, are not fully integrated into the economy or political systems, resources are being dedicated to helping expand the potential roles of girls and women in all aspects of societies.  III.	AMBASSADORS' GIRLS' SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM (AGSP): SCOPE AND OBJECTIVE 	Scholarships are awarded to girls at the primary and secondary levels to encourage them to complete their education.  Girls receiving the scholarships have mentors to promote self-development and set examples of the contributions that women can make to a society. There has been a significant bridging of the gender gap through the advancement of female education through these activities.  Former efforts of AGSP have helped countries mobilize resources to educate girls and women to foster educational development in 35 African countries.   	The AGSP program's success to date is influenced by several factors. Key among them is the involvement of a valuable, established network of local non-governmental organizations that are focused on addressing the educational needs of African women and girls, and their interrelationships with host government and expatriate entities in their countries.  The Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE), faith-based and other local implementing partners, each with specialized needs for internal strengthening as well as approaches to community outreach, constitute a critical network working alongside Peace Corps volunteers for recruitment, selection and support services to our target audience.  The management of this network to ensure an uninterrupted flow of information concerning mentoring, appropriate workforce development skills and related resources has proven essential to assuring that funds are reaching our intended beneficiaries - girls and young women who are most disadvantaged economically, socially and physically.  Administrative oversight, therefore, is an important element needed to channel funds, gather information from the range of partners, coordinate professional development and other training workshops, and to gather formative and summative data for reporting purposes.   	The range of duties involved with administrative oversight and ongoing expansion of this flagship program is specified below. IV.	TASK DESCRIPTION 	Objective 	The objective of the Ambassadors' Girls' Scholarship component under this Initiative is to enable disadvantaged girls and young women to pursue their  education and to gain valuable life skills through such activities as career camps, mentoring, Take Your Daughters to Work, orientation to the use and application of information and communications technology, internships and related skill-building activities. The underlying principle supporting this objective is that girls are the ultimate beneficiaries of the program and that the communities will gain from the benefits of having sent their daughters to school. Therefore, community buy-in/ ownership of this educational support model is critical to its sustainability. Local NGOs will be expected to advocate for sustainability at the local level, and report on results  The contractor management process must be proactive based on up-front planning and agreements reached with AFR/SD/Education, defined and monitored performance and cost milestones, frequent progress reports to AFR/SD/Education and timely identification and resolution of potential problems. 	Technical Issues and Acquisition Activities 	The contractor or contractors is/are expected to perform all necessary administrative services to successfully implement and maintain tailored AGSP programs for designated countries.  These functions will provide the foundation for performance by an independent evaluator of formative and summative evaluation of individual programs.

The scholarship tracking system consists of a database containing relevant information on each Ambassador's fund; usage and outcome of grants for each country; entry and completion data on each scholarship recipient, including individual contact and post training activity information as appropriate.   		The tracking system will also contain country profile information, to be updated quarterly; the purpose and amount by award year of each scholarship fund; complete contact information for local entities, including implementing partners (with a designated amount awarded to each); schools involved with educating scholarship recipients, and detailed mentoring contact and activity information.  This database is to track expected results, and should reflect extensive grants management, tracking and monitoring.

<DESC>The Department of Interior/GovWorks is issuing this Request for Comment (RFC) and is seeking potential contractors on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), to provide pharmacy refill support in order to standardize the Military Health System under one system and supply automation to Military Health System sites that are processing refill requests manually.  This acquisition will furnish a solution to mediate the processing of pharmacy refill requests between the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) and  TRICARE eligible beneficiaries receiving refills from DoD's Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  This solution will be required to have the following high level capabilities, 1) process refill requests from patients over the phone, 2) process refill requests from patients over the Web, 3) call patients to remind them of upcoming appointments, and 4) perform functions 1-3 during times where CHCS may be offline, updating CHCS with data on actions performed.  Additionally, the ability to 1) call patients to remind them of refills requested but not picked up, and 2) the ability to process new prescriptions during CHCS downtime and automatically update CHCS upon its return to service without users being required to perform duplicate data entry should be priced as individual options.   The Pharmacy refill request service is available to approximately 8.7 million eligible beneficiaries worldwide who receive care at 76 hospitals, more than 450 medical clinics and over 700 pharmacies that link to approximately 102 pharmacy and appointment computer systems.

<SUBJECT>A--Low Wind Speed Technology for Small Wind Turbine Development
<SOLNBR>DE-PS36-03GO93005
<RESPDATE>012403
<ARCHDATE>02232003
<CONTACT>Mary Hartford, Contracting Officer, 303-275-4762, Mary_Hartford@nrel.gov;Mary Hartford, Contract Specialist, 303-275-4762, Mary_Hartford@nrel.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is announcing its intention to issue a solicitation for financial assistance and is seeking expressions of interest and comments on a proposed approach to cost-shared, public-private projects for the development of cost-effective small wind turbines (100 kilowatts or less), for use in distributed power applications at low wind speeds throughout the United States.  The purpose of this announcement is to obtain an indication of the level of interest by industry participants and seek comments on the proposed scope of a low wind speed small wind turbine development solicitation. Expressions of interest and comments to the planned solicitation are due January 24, 2003. The solicitation is planned to be issued approximately 30 days after comments are received.   Should DOE decide to proceed, a formal solicitation will be issued. Questions or requests for additional information should be sent electronically to godwt@nrel.gov.  Expressions of interest and comments on the proposed solicitation should be submitted electronically to godwt@nrel.gov. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is soliciting expressions of interest and comments on a proposed approach to cost-shared, public-private projects for the development of cost-effective small wind turbines (100 kilowatts or less), for use in distributed power applications at low wind speeds throughout the United States, and primarily targeting residential and small business uses.  A major focus of the DOE Wind Program is the development of wind turbine technology that is cost effective for use in the vast areas of the Nation with lower wind speeds than are currently economically viable.  An important element of this mission is technology development for small wind turbines (100 kilowatts or less) that can serve a range of high valued, distributed power applications primarily targeted at residential and small business application.  The low wind speed small wind turbine development activities are planned as cooperative efforts with industry, and guided by several principles: 1) public/private partnerships will be developed to support continuing innovation.  These partnerships are intended to be flexible and adaptive, support multiple pathways, and offer opportunities for new players to enter the program; 2) wind program research and testing activities will be closely aligned to support these partnerships; 3) applied systems integration activities will guide portfolio planning and technology transfer; and 4) program evaluations will be performed regularly using performance-based management techniques as the basis for performance criteria, periodic review, and adjustment. The goal of the low wind speed small wind turbine development projects is to develop a class of small wind turbines (100kW or less) for residential and small business applications that provide cost effective performance in Class 3 wind resources by 2007.  To achieve this goal, DOE intends to provide financial support via Grants and Cooperative Agreements for public-private partnerships to complete concept studies, component development, and/or turbine prototype development for multiple technology pathways.  Given the range of turbine sizes and applications of interest, performance goals for each partnership effort will be established individually.  The objective for each effort is to achieve the level of costs effectiveness in Class 3 wind resources that can be achieved in Class 5 resources with current baseline technology.  Applicants will propose an appropriate cost performance target for Class 3 wind resources, using a standard cost of energy calculation method to be provided in the solicitation. Industry partnerships and related supporting research and testing activities will be coordinated to facilitate technology transfer and transition of conceptual design and component development projects into system development. All partnerships activities will be periodically reviewed against established milestones as the basis for funding and planning adjustments needed to optimize the portfolio for success. Under the planned solicitation, DOE will be soliciting applications for: 1) Conceptual Design Studies, 2) Component Development, and 3) Prototype Turbine Development projects, for small-scale turbine designs (less than 100 kilowatts) for distributed power applications. Conceptual Design Studies (Technical Area 1) are envisioned as 6-12 month efforts with a maximum of DOE funding being $100,000 for any single award. No cost share will be required.  Awards for Conceptual Design Studies are anticipated to be Grants. Component Development (Technical Area 2) is envisioned as an 18-24 month effort with the DOE funding being between $500,000 and $1 million for any single award.  The program anticipates a cost-shared agreement with a minimum cost share requirement of 30% by the offeror.  As DOE intends to be substantially involved, awards are expected to be Cooperative agreements. Prototype Turbine Development (Technical Area 3) is envisioned as a three-year effort with a maximum DOE funding of $1,500,000 for any single award.  The program intends to use a cost-shared agreement with a minimum cost share requirement of 50% by the offeror.  As DOE intends to be substantially involved, awards are expected to be Cooperative Agreements.  Initial prototype wind turbines are expected to complete field-testing by 2007. The program expects to award one to three agreements under each Technical Area with projects incrementally funded on a fiscal year basis.  Additional consideration in the evaluation process will be given for cost sharing in excess of the minimum required amount.  Applicants may submit more than one application under any or all the Technical Areas.  However, diversity of technology and participants within the DOE Wind Program will be factors in selecting applications for negotiation of award. Throughout the projects, the program will encourage the use of best business and project-management practices.  Disciplined engineering development processes, including rigorous laboratory and field tests to verify component and subsystem designs, will be emphasized. Applications will need to include a description of the proposed concept in sufficient detail as to allow evaluation by a group of knowledgeable reviewers; identify planned teaming arrangements; and include a proposed budget and schedule.  The program expects a majority of the work to be performed within the United States, and applicants will be asked to demonstrate the economic benefits of the proposed project to the United States.  Qualified business and technical professionals will evaluate the written applications.  Awards will be based upon technical viability, projected Cost of Energy (COE), capabilities, and the likelihood of achieving program goals and objectives. The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) U.S> Small Wind Turbine Industry Roadmap document (http://www.awea.org/smallwind/documents/31958.pdf) identifies specific areas of interest that relate to future advances in distributed wind technology.  These areas of interest included: 1) reduction in turbine system costs; 2) reduction in manufacturing costs; 3) improvements in reliability; 4) improvements in power electronics design and reliability; 5) reduction of noise; 6) development of better analytical tools; 7) improvement in overspeed control knowledge; 8) development of more-cost effective, taller towers. Expressions of interest are sought from potential applicants to the forthcoming solicitation, and comments on the proposed plan are sought from all interested parties.  Expressions of interest should not include detailed proposals, but should include the following information: 1) the names, addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers, and electronic mail address of the primary contact person for the planned application; 2) potential participants, their affiliation, and proposed roles, including the need for support from National Laboratories such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) or Sandia National Laboratory (SNL); 3) comments on the proposed solicitation; 4) a statement indicating the Technical Area under which an application for financial assistance will be submitted; and 5) a brief description of the concept to be proposed.  Responses to this notice should not exceed five pages. To be considered, responses should be received by January 24, 2003.  Once issued, Solicitation Number DE-PS36-03GO93005 will include complete information including technical aspects, funding, application preparation instructions, evaluation criteria, and other factors that will be considered when selecting applications for funding.  Issuance of the solicitation is planned for February 2003, with applications due approximately 60 calendar days after the solicitation is issued.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, intends to conduct a limited competition between Bell Avon, Inc. of Picayune, MS and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies, Inc. of Fenwick, WV to award a firm fixed price contract to manufacture an LCAC Deep Skirt System.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers fabricating LCAC flexible skirt systems. These manufacturers were qualified in accordance with Government document No. 802-6336529, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND REQUIREMENTS DATED 01 APRIL, 1996, Revision C and document No. 802-6336530, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT FABRICATION PROCEDURES dated 01 A pril, 1996, Revision B.  To date only Bell Avon, Inc. and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies have been certified as capable of providing the required LCAC flexible skirt systems.  As such these are the only two firms capable of competing for this requirement.  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor to provide items under the general grouping of metals and metal products and ancillary services for the Southeast Region of the United States. A Prime Vendor, or integrated supplier, can be defined as the designation of a single source of supply for a wide range of products. The requirements covered under this solicitation include, but are not limited to, aluminum, stainless steel, carbon steel, copper, brass, titanium, nickel, alloys, and other industrial metals, in several forms, including wire, plate, sheet, strip, bar, angle, extrusion, pipe, tube, valves, fittings, and any other shape required by the ordering activities. The items required under this solicitation are not fixed to a discrete group of NSNs. Rather, requirements may change and expand or contract due to the needs of our customers. Related services such as cutting to size, scrap and salvage metal removal, and technical support will be included in any resultant contract as needed by ordering activities. 
The Southeast Region consists of the following states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.  
Prospective contractors should have an on-line Electronic Order Entry (EOE) system and must have Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) capability. Subject solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contract being an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for two base years with three (3) one-year term options. This will be a best value source selection acquisition in which technical merit is considered more important than price. Solicitation SP0560-02-R-0341 is expected to be issued by December 16, 2002 with an estimated closing date of January 30, 2003.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to replace the previous description in its entirety with the following:

The USAID Regional Contracting Officer in Budapest Hungary intends to award a sole-source contract for approximately 36 months beginning on or about  February 15, 2003 at an estimated $10 million to BearingPoint. The contract will enable BearingPoint to expand their services in assisting the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBJ) to enhance and strengthen the operation, management and dispatch of all Central Bank functions in order to ensure a safe, sound and stable banking system in Serbia. The contract is being sole-sourced under AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) for the continued provision of specialized services when award to another resource would result in additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays. In accordance with Numbered Note 22: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION NUMBER IS CORRECTED TO READ FROM 2003-N-00771 TO 2003-N-00711!!!
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine a requirement for a three-year contract to collaborate with CDC's TB Trials Consortium in a phase 2 trial of moxifloxacin versus ethambutol in the 4-drug intensive phase of treatment of tuberculosis.  Through its field collaboration with Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, Case Western can assure access to large numbers of patients with active TB disease who can be enrolled within 7 days of the start of TB therapy, treated with FDA-approved companion medications, and monitored by an experienced clinical staff able to comply with FDA requirements for Good Clinical Practices.  The site must also have ready access to a fully qualified mycobacteriology laboratory, and must be experienced in data management for large scale clinical trials, and must have an available ethics committee meeting all Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) requirements.   The site must be capable of enrolling 150 patients over the course of two years, and following patients during the full six months of TB treatment.   Moreover, because costly supplies of study drugs and matching placebo will expire in early 2005, the site must be able promptly to begin enrollment immediately following the expected award date of April 1, 2003.  Case Western is the only known contractor with the unique capacity in the area of TB clinical trials AND who possesses the current capacity to satisfy the stringent time requirements for this procurement.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by notifying Cynthia R. Collins by email at coc9@cdc.gov or by facsimile at 770-488-2688.  Note 22.

Contact Person:  Carol Watkins, GSA Contract Specialist, 816-823-4906; fax 816-823-5523.

The purpose of this source selection procurement is to select a quality Design-Build Services contractor for Roof Replacement (IMO23015) at Federal Building 1, Bannister Complex, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri, Solicitation Number GS06P02GZC0539.  The contractor selected will be responsible for taking the scope and performance documents (prepared by an architect/engineer) through design and construction.  The estimated cost of design and construction for the design-build contract is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The contract length shall be proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Government, but shall not exceed 15 months (450 calendar days) after Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about May 6, 2003.  This procurement will be completed using a two-step source selection process. This contract is restricted only to those firms having an existing general construction contracting office in one of the following four states:  Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska, and such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this announcement.

Building 1 consists of a basement and a ground level.  There have been numerous incidences of leaks in tenant space, with the possibility of severe damage to tenant property due to roof leaks.  Building 1 of the Bannister Federal Complex is primarily used for warehousing and has a concrete barrel-vaulted roof structure.  The roof is in poor condition and in need of complete replacement.  The total project size is approximately 641,980 square feet.  The building roofs are built-up modified bitumen of various compositions.

The scope of work includes the following:  1)  Replacing the approximately 641,890 square feet of existing roof over GSA controlled space; and 2) Increasing the roof system from an approximate average R-value of 9 to an R-value of 26.  Asbestos contaminated material is on the roof, and any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed after regular business hours.

The request for technical proposals (RFTP) solicitation will be issued on or about January 15, 2003.  All requests for the RFTP must be in writing.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the Bid Documents.  Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must provide valid identification in the form of one of the following:  a business license; DUNS number, or valid state driver?s license.

A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on or about January 23, 2003 at the GSA Office, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri.  GSA will receive proposals on or about February 13, 2003.  Date and time will be specified in the RFTP.  Only one proposal will be submitted by each offeror.

The Government will use the ?greatest value? concept in selecting the prime contractor.  This concept is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  Proposals will be evaluated in two phases.  Phase I will be technical evaluations of proposals to establish those within a competitive range.  Phase II will be receipt of pricing and scheduling, which will only be received from those firms short-listed under Phase I technical evaluations.  The short list will be published in FedBizOpps at www.FedBizOpps.gov, on or about March 17, 2003.  Phase I technical proposals will be evaluated using the following technical factors, in descending order of importance:  1)  Past performance of the firm; 2) Management plan; 3) Qualifications of key personnel; and 4) Team composition, organization and prior experience as a Design-Build team.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  

Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  This is a negotiated procurement that will result in a firm-fixed price contract.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval. 

Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established subcontracting goals of 40% total for Small Business (SB), which includes 8% for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB); 5% for Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), 2.5% for Hub Zone Small Business; (HZSB); 5% for Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB); and 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  Contact Carol Watkins, Contract Specialist, to request the RFTP and for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4906 or fax her at 816-823-5523.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, George Gourse, at 816-823-2262.

<CONTACT>Contract Specialist John Miller at 850-235-5399, or Contracting Officer Carol Dreger at 850-234-4863.
<DESC>The Coastal Systems Station (CSS), Dahlgren Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center is interested in receiving information on computer-based software systems suitable for mission planning, execution, and data retrieval and presentation utilizing a variety of specified underwater mine countermeasures vehicles and tools.  This Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting research efforts planned for the 2003-2005 fiscal years leading to the acquisition of a development system.  This is a Sources Sought announcement and no Request for Proposals (RFP) or solicitation is currently planned to result from this announcement.  CSS is interested in software systems that will support planning, programming, data retrieval, and data presentation of manned and autonomous underwater mine countermeasures systems working in the deep water, shallow water, and very shallow water zones.  Ultimately the system will support the initial planning of a manned and/or autonomous underwater mine countermeasures survey of an area; a virtual simulation of the planned survey; the ability to make changes to the planned survey on-site as needed; output to the operator and/or vehicle enabling them to conduct the planned survey; data retrieval from the operator/vehicle following the survey; output from the first-phase survey into the planning of a second-phase survey; the ability to simulate, make changes on-site to, output to the operator/vehicle for, and data retrieval from the planned second-phase survey; additional survey iterations following the aforementioned sequence as needed; and the ability to amalgamate and present survey data in a usable form to an end-user decision maker.  The system must be able to be imp lemented as an open-architecture solution suited to modular and evolutionary/spiral development and improvement and must be able to be tailored to the planning, execution, and data retrieval of a variety of specified VSW/EOD MCM tools.  The system must be able to be field-deployed in stand-alone configurations utilizing only mission-acceptable computer hardware resources and peripherals.  Potential missions include at-sea use while aboard a small inflatable craft.  A key component of the software system will be its ease of use of operator interfaces for mission programming, program simulation and checking, mission program modification, as needed, retrieval of mission data, and information generation for end decision makers.  Data captured by the system must eventually be transferable to compatible Navy tactical displays and information systems. This RFI/Sources Sought addresse s two major categories: Category A) Mature software systems that can be fielded in the near term to support user operational evaluations for the development of the VSW/EOD MCM common operator interface mission planning concept of operations and requirements. Category B) Mature software systems possessing the potential for open-architecture, modular and evolutionary/spiral development and improvement to be tailored to the planning, execution, and data retrieval of a variety of specified VSW/EOD MCM tools. Interested parties must provide written submittals, to be received by the Government by COB on 31 January 2003.  The Government will assess submittals by the end of February, 2003 for their potential to solve the computer-based software system common operator interface problem.  Contractors? submittals that are determined by the evaluation team as possessing the potential  for contributing to the common operator interface mission solution may be provided the opportunity to demonstrate their system/platform at some point in the future.  Contractors may submit a paper for either of the two categories identified above, or both, but each submission must identify which category is addressed or the submission will not be considered.  The submissions will be assessed as follows: Category A)  For mature software systems that can be fielded in the near term, the criteria of interest to the Government are system technical maturity, potential effectiveness, capability/completeness of the system, suitability, ease of use/usability, cost, schedule, support requirements for a period of two years, and past performance to support user operational evaluations for the development of the VSW/EOD MCM common operator interface mission planning concept of operations  and requirements. Category B)  For software systems possessing the potential for open-architecture, modular and evolutionary/spiral development and improvement, the criteria of interest to the Government are system technical maturity, potential effectiveness, suitability, ease of use/usability, cost, schedule, past performance, and the ability to be tailored to the planning, execution, and data retrieval of a variety of specified VSW/EOD MCM tools. There is no specific format or outline that submittals must follow.  However, information pertinent to the criteria of interest, especially system technical maturity and capability, must be provided.  Include other descriptive literature and any other specific or pertinent information that would enhance consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  Offerors responding must also indicate whether they are a small busi ness (S), a small disadvantaged business (SDB), 8(a), or large business (L).  Please include four (4) copies of each response.  Each response must reference the RFI title, which category is being addressed, and must be limited in length to ten (10) typed pages.  Specific narrative information that should be provided with the submission include: (1) System description and capabilities, (2) Chronology of system development, (3) Summary of past test or evaluation events with location, dates, and results, (4) If available, logistic supportability and projected cost estimate information, (5) In anticipation of Contractor selection for a potential future limited scope demonstration, provide an explanation of what would be demonstrated and identify any special/unique support required from the Government that would enhance to offeror?s participation in a demonstration, (6) For submissi ons under Category A (mature, complete systems), include an estimated cost for the purchase of two complete software systems, any required supporting hardware and peripherals, and two years of contractor support; this may be in addition to the information submission that is limited to ten pages.  Supporting literature and test documentation that demonstrates technical maturity of your proposed solution should be included. The Navy is contemplating convening a limited-scope demonstration in mid-March 2003 and anticipates inviting selected contractors to demonstrate their system capabilities.  For the purposes of the demonstration, the focus will be on verifying system ability to satisfy the criteria of interest while operating in a simulated underwater mine countermeasures scenario of mission planning, virtual simulation and on-site modification of the plan, output plan to the  operator/vehicle for mission execution, data retrieval from the executed mission, and data presentation and analysis of the mission data collected to an end-user decision maker.  However, only a limited amount of data and underwater mine countermeasures vehicles and tools will be utilized in any such demonstration.  If conducted, the Government does not anticipate providing funds for offerors to participate in the demonstrations.  Contractors given an opportunity to demonstrate their system will be provided additional details, including demonstration schedule and the extent of support the Government will provide.  If conducted, the Government reserves the right to identify those contractors who will be give an opportunity to participate in the demonstration. A half-day information session is planned for mid-January in the Panama City, Florida area.  Register via e-mail to Mr.  John Miller, Contract Specialist, MillerJH@ncsc.navy.mil no later than two weeks after the date of publication of this RFI so that adequate meeting facilities can be provided.  All expenses for attendance must be borne by the contractor.  Additional information regarding the meeting format, local hotels, security procedures, and other relevant information will be provided via return e-mail to all who register. Information should be submitted to the attention of:  (in hard copy only) Mr. John Miller, Contract Specialist, Code XPS1, Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (NSWCDD CSS), 6703 W. Highway 98, Panama City FL 32407.  Technical Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to MR. Eric Pierce, Phone Number 850 235 5595. Telephone responses will not be honored.

Task orders would require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects would also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase of 3 to 5 proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), Management Approach; and Small Business subcontracting effort.  Phase I design-build factors relate to the four (4) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, aircraft maintenance, hangars, training, dormitory, family housing repair, and community support type facilities. Only those proposers selected in Phase I would be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the successful 3 to 5 Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals for would not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal would require preparation of a limited design solution; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Cost and Price proposals may include total cost; evaluation of scope/design options within the Government's published budget for award, and an evaluation of change order mark-ups and overhead.  The best value proposal will be awarded a project and an IDIQ design-build contract for the four (4) year term.  The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s).  A minimum guarantee of $100,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s).  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the offeror(s) are awarded no task orders over the four (4) year contract term.  Task orders would be competed among the three to five firms that were awarded an IDIQ ,with each task order awarded based on best value or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable proposal.  If your firm would be interested in this type of contract please submit the name of your firm, point of contact, telephone number and email address to Susie Conner at email connerms@efdsouth.navfac.navy.mil by 4:30pm/EST on 13 January 2003.  Please state that your firm is interested in the IDIQ contract for Key West, FL.  If you have any questions, please contact Susie Conner at 843-743-7575 ext 5443.  A determination will be made, once responses are received, to determine if this type contract will be issued for Key West, FL.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps is issuing this Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought synopsis as part of a market survey. Sources are sought that can provide the Avenger Short Range Air Defense System with a thermal imaging system allowing the Avenger operators to detect, recognize, and identify airborne targets.  Various aspects of the desired system are outlined in the following paragraphs.



System Description



The Avenger is a HMMWV platform fitted with a weapon-turret consisting of Stinger surface-to-air missiles and a .50 caliber machine gun.  Its primary role is as an air defense weapons platform.  The desired Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) will be externally mounted to the Avenger turret and will be exposed to all elements of an external environment, and could be required to withstand the environmental conditions outlined in MIL-STD-810, Environmental Test Methods & Engineering Guidelines.  The FLIR will be expected to withstand the shock and vibration associated with the HMMWV platform and its weapons.  The FLIR shall utilize 28V DC power supplied by the HMMWV and shall have an RS-170 compatible video line output.  The FLIR should be compatible with the Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC), allowing overlay of tracking cues and other targeting information from the AFCC on to the video displayed at the monitor.  Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) submitting information should describe in detail their capabilities for utilizing the existing monitor and controls, as well as concepts of utilization for any new controllers, monitors, or other Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) (spell out).



Threshold Performance Criteria



The current Avenger FLIR is being used as a baseline from which to build the capability of the future Avenger FLIR.   Therefore, the current performance criteria given in this section are being used as the Threshold Performance Criteria.    Manufacturers? systems submitted as a response to this RFI must at minimum meet all of the outlined threshold criteria. Included in these criteria are the following specifications:



1.) Field of View (FOV) ? The current Avenger FLIR utilizes three fields of view.  These are:

WIDE - 21?H?14?V;  RAIN - 12?H?8?V; and NARROW 5.3?H?3.5?V. As a minimum, any submitting OEM must address at least the WIDE and NARROW FOVs, or provide concepts of combinations of FOVs that will allow the operators an optimum capability of target detection, recognition, and identification tasks.  



2.) Detector Parameters - The following parameters should be considered the minimum performance requirements for the desired FLIR.

a. Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference (NETD) ? The Current Avenger FLIR has a Long-Wave IR detector that has a NETD of 360 mK.  As Threshold criteria, the NETD of any submitted FLIR must be no greater than 360 mK.  

b. Pixel Size -- The current pixel size is 45 mm ? the pixel size of systems submitted as a result of this RFI must have a pixel dimension of no greater than 45 mm.  The current system is a SPRITE scanning system, though for this RFI, any submitted systems must utilize serial scanning linear arrays or staring focal plane arrays.

c. Waveband - As a threshold, OEM?s can submit information on imagers sensitive to either the mid-wave (3-5 mm) or long-wave (8-12 mm) infrared wavebands.  



3.) Cooler Parameters ? The following parameters should be considered minimum performance requirements for the detector-cooling unit of the new Avenger FLIR.

a. Cool-Down Time  -- Currently the cool-down time, or the time from powering ON the FLIR until an image is available, is no greater than 5 minutes.  The desired FLIR should have a cool-down time of no greater than 5 minutes. 

b. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) ? At a minimum the cooler of the FLIR must have a Mean Time Between Failures of no less than 3,000 hours.



Objective Performance Criteria



The current state of thermal imaging technology should allow the capabilities of a modern FLIR to exceed the performance characteristics of the existing Avenger FLIR.  It is desirable that the replacement FLIR for the Avenger exceed the older technology in all aspects.  The following is a list of Objective Performance Criteria that should allow the FLIR performance to be greatly enhanced over the existing Avenger FLIR.



1.) FOV ? The objective for the upgraded Avenger FLIR FOV is a two or three FOV system that could extend both the current detection and identification ranges. The wide FOV of the desired FLIR should have similar coverage of the current WIDE FOV for target detection tasks.  The objective Medium and Narrow FOVs are, for the purposes of this RFI, being left open to the concepts of the OEMs.  FOVs that are narrower than the existing Avenger FLIR are achievable and offer improved target recognition and identification ranges.  OEMs are encouraged to submit information on a combination of Medium and Narrow FOVs that will provide an optimum performance of target detection, recognition, and identification.



2.) Detector Parameters - The following parameters should be considered the objective performance requirements for the detector of a desirable FLIR.

a. Detector Type - As an objective performance criterion, the detector will be a staring Focal Plane Array (FPA) and will utilize no moving parts in the optical train.

b. FPA Size - As an objective criterion, the detector FPA will be composed of at least a 256?256-pixel array.  A system with a larger FPA size will be considered more desirable than systems with a smaller array size, all else being equal.

c. NETD ? As an objective criterion, the NETD of any submitted FLIR must be no greater than 70 mK.  Systems with a lower NETD will be considered more desirable than systems with a higher NETD, all else being equal.

d. Pixel Size ? As an objective criterion, pixel size will be no greater than 30 mm. 

e. Waveband - As an objective criterion the desirable FLIR shall be sensitive to mid-wave infrared energy (3-5 mm wavelength).



3.) Cooler Parameters ? The following parameters should be considered objective performance requirements for the detector-cooling unit of the new Avenger FLIR.

Cool-Down Time   - As an objective criterion, the desired FLIR must have a cool-down time of no greater than 4 minutes. 

MTBF ? As an objective criterion, the cooler of the FLIR must have a Mean Time Between Failures of greater than 5,000 hours.



4.) Integrated Laser Rangefinder (LRF)? As an objective criterion, the desired FLIR shall have an integrated LRF that provides an eyesafe means to accurately determine the exact range to a target.  As a threshold, the LRF shall accurately range to a minimum of 5 km.  As an objective, the LRF shall accurately range a target to 10 km.  It is considered desirable to have extended range with an integrated LRF, all else being equal.  The LRF must be eyesafe.



Responses to this RFI shall as a minimum include; 1) A capability assessment of the company to include production readiness, 2) a description of product and information on how it meets the specification above to include any potential modification to a COTS item needed to achieve the specification 3) Procurement lead time, 3) Rough order of magnitude (ROM) of unit price for potential for purchases from 1 to 1000 units, at quantity intervals placed at the discretion of the OEM. 4) Any potential non-recurring cost, 5) Current failure rate (replacement or repair history), 6) Costing for two years of Contractor Logistics Support and any other maintenance information.  



The RFI should be sent to MSgt J.J. Reznicek,  Avenger Project Officer, Marine Corps Systems Comman, Daly Hall, 2079 Wharton Ave., Quantico, VA 22134 or e-mailed to Reznicekjj@mcsc.usmc.mil with a copy sent to Valerie Mosqueira at same address or e-mailed to mosqueiravj@mcsc.usmc.mil.  CLASSIFIED RESPONSES MAY BE SENT TO THE FOLLOWING SIPERNET ADDRESS: Reznicekjj@mcsc.usmc.smil.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing a contract that would provide resources and expertise to help us accelerate therapeutics development for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). NINDS is attempting to identify competent sources to establish and coordinate pre-clinical research activities leading to a new treatment for SMA, and is seeking input from experienced sources into the design of a proposed statement of work for the project. 



Background

The NINDS wishes to develop a treatment for SMA, a devastating neurological disease of childhood. SMA is an ideal candidate for targeted therapeutics development for two reasons. First, it is caused by the loss of function of a known gene product. Thus, there are tractable strategies for developing treatments based on replacement of the lost function. Second, SMA is the most severe of the common genetically recessive neurological diseases. Currently, no effective treatment for SMA exists. 



The overall objective of the proposed contract is to accelerate the development of a treatment for SMA through the establishment of an innovative SMA translational research program. This program will pursue parallel research avenues for therapeutics development in a coordinated, rapid, milestone-driven process to identify a testable therapy suitable for clinical trials. Clinical trials will not be undertaken as part of this program. The contract will establish the SMA research program and coordinate its progress, implementing a fast and focused process in response to the NINDS strategic plan.



Organizations capable of fulfilling this effort must be able to: 1) Establish an SMA Research Program consisting of institutions capable of providing the scientific and administrative expertise necessary to perform therapeutics development studies for SMA. 2) Manage a strategic plan that must include processes for a) establishing research priorities; b) reviewing, modifying, approving and disapproving research studies; c) allocating resources; d) monitoring and evaluating progress and maintaining effective working relationships. 3) Provide input on research progress to a Program Oversight Committee. 



Information Requested

Information and advice in the following areas will aid in the design of a statement of work and solicitation for establishment and oversight of the SMA research program. We ask that organizations that have performed such services identify critical criteria to include in the solicitation and describe their capabilities to meet these criteria. This information can address performance measures, standards and incentives, as well as possible criteria for judging success. The information supplied in response to this request need not be limited to these areas. 



1. Establishing the SMA Research Program



The SMA research program will be established through subcontracts, awarded by the contractor, to individual research laboratories. The requirements for these subcontracts will be defined by the NINDS strategic plan for SMA therapeutics development. The contractor will be responsible for soliciting and reviewing research proposals with a targeted review and award cycle of approximately 4 months. We anticipate 3 standard application receipt dates per year. At the discretion of NINDS, up to 6-10 solicitations may be released per year, with 5-30 research proposals submitted per solicitation. The contractor will establish a scientific review committee(s) that could meet as often as 3 times per year. Based on the results of the scientific reviews and the priorities of the program, final award selection recommendations would be forwarded to NINDS. The NINDS will ultimately be responsible for final award selection (or: for approving all award selection recommendations). With respect to the establishment of the research program: 



i. Describe your capabilities for the efficient and fair solicitation and review of research proposals for a pre-clinical therapeutics development program.

ii. Describe the criteria and strategies you would apply in establishing a peer review committee and in managing data related to the reviews.

iii. Describe the expertise and level of effort of personnel necessary to solicit and review proposals according to the above schedule.

2. Subcontract Award and Management

Research conducted by the SMA network will be funded through awards issued by the contractor as subcontracts.  It is anticipated that up to 6-12 subcontracts may be issued each year.

i. Describe the personnel and database requirements associated with awarding and managing multiple subcontracts, including quality control procedures.

ii. Describe your capabilities for evaluating the budgets of subcontract proposals.

iii. Describe your strategies for insuring that subcontracted research projects are completed on schedule and within budget.

3. Program Management and Evaluation

To maximize the rate of progress, researchers in the SMA network will be required to interact and collaborate with each other and to report progress regularly to an oversight committee selected by NINDS. The contractor will be required to develop a meeting schedule to facilitate these interactions. In addition, the contractor will be required to evaluate the progress of the subcontracted research against the goals of the NINDS strategic plan and communicate these evaluations to the oversight committee.

i. Describe your experience with strategic planning efforts.

ii. Describe your experience with the evaluation of the success or failure of scientific programs.

iii. Describe your experience with planning and conducting meetings.

4. Personnel

Please provide an overall assessment of the number and mix of personnel required to accomplish the tasks outlined above and the approximate level of effort required for each. Include a description of the scientific and technical expertise required.

This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government?s use of such information. Respondents will not be notified of the Government?s evaluation of the information received. Should a proposed solicitation materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government?s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. Responses will be held in a confidential manner. Any proprietary information should be so marked.

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business or organization, e.g., Large Business, Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, or other profit or non-profit organization.

Responses should be limited to 20 pages, should be identified with RFI No. NS-03-005, and are due by February 1, 2003. Please submit three (3) copies of your response to:

If it is demonstrated that two or more small business concerns have the capability to perform this requirement, procedures under FAR Part 19 utilizing the appropriate small business set-aside program may be initiated. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 561421.  Small business size standard is $6M.  
***** THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  ***** BACKGROUND:  Base personnel operate the current base operator service.  In an attempt to save the Government funding and manpower this market research notice is being offered to find innovative ideas offered to automate most or all of the current operations.  ***** REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION:  Please provide commercially available system specifications including capacity and cost.  All options, recommendations and information will be evaluated to find the most effective solutions.  *** 1) There are six telephone operators working during the busiest hours of the day.  Eighty percent of their work involves directory assistance. The volume of traffic is about 1 call per minute per operator at peak.  Estimates are that the system will need a vocabulary of 5000 words/phrases.  Capability must include local administration of the vocabulary; i.e. an Offutt administrator must be able to tailor the vocabulary quickly with immediate system response.  This may be referred to as text to speech capability.  ** a.  The system must be able to answer the call and identify itself as the Offutt AFB Automated Directory Assistance System.  The caller must be prompted to state the purpose of their call.  The system must respond by either giving the number or giving the number and transferring the call.  ** b. The caller must be able to dial "0" to talk to an operator.  *** 2 - Specify whether or not the system includes an automated touchtone tree.  Include the number of inbounds ports required to support the system and the number of virtual operators that capacity represents.  Specify whether or not the system is equipt to handle a T-1 and switch at a 24-virtual operator capacity.   *** 3 - Current operations include a base locator function used to obtain the telephone number of personnel assigned to the base.  Specify whether or not the automated base locator functions are available.  This may include a database lookup system with the ability to provide information which is stored in the database to callers.  Request that this function be specified and priced separately as an optional function to any other system or systems.   *** 4 - Specify whether or not the system has the capability to process a telephonic request from base personnel to place a long distance telephone call.  A single-use authorization number must be provided by the caller.  Please indicate whether or not the system would be capable of verifying the validity of the number against a prescribed format prior to placing the call.   *** 5 - Please detail the types of statistical reports which can be generated by the system.  The system must be able to produce reports that detail each call including the number and duration of calls.  The system must also have a diagnostic feature built in to provide notice of system problems.  It must be easily repairable and have redundancy built in.  *****  INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS ** 1 -  Respondents capable of performing this effort are requested to submit a capability package to the following address: 55 CONS/LGCB, 101 Washington Square, Attn: Joseph Sherwood, Offutt AFB NE 68113-2107, no later than 4:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time 17 January 2003.

<SUBJECT>A -- Tri-Service Study that will determine the current directed energy test and evaluation infrastructure requirements
<DESC>THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE TO ANNOUNCE PLANS AND SOLICIT INFORMATION FOR THE CENTRAL TEST AND EVALUATION INVESTMENT PROGRAM (CTEIP) FUNDED TRI-SERVICE STUDY (T-SS) OF DIRECTED ENERGY TEST AND EVALUATION INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS - THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. The Air Force does not intend to award a contract or assistance instrument as a result of response(s) to this notice.  Information obtained from this and subsequent requests, however, will strongly influence the basis of future contract actions.  CTEIP is funding a Tri-Service Study (T-SS) that will determine the current directed energy (DE) test and evaluation (T&E) infrastructure requirements, capabilities, shortfalls, and solutions.  The T-SS will produce roadmaps of recommended solutions to the current shortfalls. Directed Energy Test and Evaluation Capabilities (DETEC) is a proposal to CTEIP that will implement the infrastructure solutions contained in the T-SS roadmaps. DETEC is estimated at $48M for FY04-08. One purpose of this notice is to announce the T-SS and encourage parties in industry, academia and government with DE interest and expertise to participate in the solution development process.  HQ AFOTEC, Kirtland AFB, will host an industry day that will be open to all interested parties on 4 Feb 2003.  The industry day is an opportunity to meet the government management team and learn more about both DETEC and the T-SS.  The T-SS will solicit ideas for the development of solutions to specific shortfalls as they are discovered by the study.  This solicitation for ideas will be accomplished through a BAA to be issued in the July 2003 time period.  Responses to the BAA must be received within 30 days and will be in the form of white papers that detail the following: a description of each idea, how the idea responds to the identified shortfall, how each idea could be used or integrated on existing MRTFBs and/or facilities, what the mobility characteristics are, and schedule/cost estimates for construction of the solution.  Proposal ideas will not be shared or discussed outside the government and will be considered proprietary if the respondent so desires.  The government will be using a contractor to manage and perform bookkeeping on responses to these solution requests; the contractor will abide by an existing conflict of interest clause to ensure non-disclosure of any proprietary information.  The government will evaluate proposed solution ideas and select one or more of them to be placed in the T-SS roadmap.  Proposed solutions will be evaluated based on risk, maturity, cost, program need date, suggested location and also against other proposed solutions.  The government may also utilize federally funded research and development centers to help provide assessments and prioritization of solution ideas into the T-SS roadmap.  If a chosen solution idea has proprietary information, only non-proprietary information will be included in the T-SS roadmap.  Some shortfall requirements, and thus some solution proposals, may be classified at the SECRET level.  In order to receive classified shortfall requests, organizations must provide a POC along with a secure means of communication (classified fax, classified email, or classified mailing address) to the T-SS point of contact listed below.  DETEC will implement the T-SS roadmap in separate contracting efforts (whether by RFP or BAA) for some or all of the solutions contained in the T-SS roadmap beginning in FY04.  Competition for DETEC infrastructure projects will be open to all.  Offerors do not have to participate in the T-SS solution development process in order to submit a proposal to future solicitations that result from DETEC?s implementation of the T-SS roadmap.  Respondents who participate in this solution development process will not be given preference during the evaluation of proposals submitted under future DETEC contracting efforts.  Responses to this notice should be an RSVP to the T-SS industry day on 4 Feb 2003.  Organizations desiring to receive classified proposal requests should identify a POC and secure means of communication to the T-SS point of contact listed below.  The following schedule is anticipated: RSVP to T-SS industry day - NLT 27 Jan 03; POCs for classified shortfall requests provided from interested contractual parties - NLT 30 Jun 03; invitation to provide solution ideas for specific shortfalls - beginning 1 July 2003 but NLT 28 Aug 2003; due date for solution idea white papers- 28 Aug 2003; DETEC BAAs and RFPs - beginning in FY04.
