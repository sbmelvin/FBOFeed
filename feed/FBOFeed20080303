<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to set-aside for a small business concern the purchase of an updated patient education video describing the risk and benefits of ACAM2000 vaccine.   In the aftermath of the anthrax attacks of 2001, efforts were undertaken to prepare a response for various bioterrorism agents.  Because smallpox had been eradicated, the only vaccines available were no longer licensed and would have to be given as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol.  However, if there was a need to conduct mass vaccination clinics in a short time, videos would be required in order to more quickly impart the risks and benefits of the vaccine under the terms of the IND.  In 2003, a production company was hired to create these videos.  They were distributed to all public health agencies in the United States to be used in the event of a smallpox attack.  In 2007, a new smallpox vaccine was licensed.  While it will no longer require the amount of information as the IND product, public health agencies still need a way to easily explain the risks and benefits of the vaccine in the event mass vaccination is required. This contract is to hire a production company to create a new version of this patient education video.  The full solicitation document shall be uploaded within 24 hours and it is your responsibility to retrieve the solicitation from herein, thereafter.  The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at this site for downloading when issued. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted or entertained.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has issued a Solicitation for Letters of Interest (LOIs) to U.S. Small Businesses for the development of prototype photovoltaic (PV) modules and pilot production. This LOI is in support of U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Solar America Initiative (SAI). Authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the SAI represents a significant enhancement of DOE's business strategy of partnering with the U.S. industry to accelerate commercialization of PV system research and development (R&D) to meet aggressive cost and installed capacity goals. This Solicitation is targeted at R&D on PV cell and module prototypes with demonstrated functionality in either large-area coupon form or, preferably, prototypes produced in pilot-scale operations. The emphasis on proposed activities should be on the barriers to manufacturing scale-up and 2010 commercialization. The primary objective of this program is to shorten the timeline for companies to transition prototype and pre-commercial PV technologies into pilot and full-scale manufacture. Responders to this solicitation are expected to focus their efforts on a limited number of high impact module technical improvement opportunities that lie on the critical path to scaling-up their technology to full manfuacture. The minimum entrance criterion is a demonstrated coupon-scale PV cell or process lab devices or modules. The successful exit criterion is for prototype modules and pilot production demonstration of greater than 3MW/year. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that 6 to 10 subcontracts, up to $3M each, will be awarded as 18 month phased subcontracts. A Net Conference regarding the project is scheduled for Monday, March 17, 2008, 9:30 A.M. Mountain Time. The Solicitation is available to view/download from NREL's website at:http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html

<RESPDATE>042108
<ARCHDATE>03032009
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for a pasture facility located within the continental U.S. to maintain up to 2,350 wild horses for one year, with 4 additional one year option periods.  The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility: Wild horses on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild and Free Roaming Wild Horses and Burro Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse Program.  Some of the horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are currently being cared for by the Tadpole Cattle Company in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. The purpose of this contract is to continue the maintenance of these animals for the remainder of their lives. The possibility exists that more unadoptable animals will be removed from the range and transported to the facility.  This is not the preferred management method for these animals; however, on occasion it will be necessary to place animals at the facility, on an as needed basis.  It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract. The horses currently being maintained at the Bartlesville facility are a non-reproductive herd consisting of primarily older horses in the age range of 5 30 years old.  They consist of mares and geldings, with no stallions in the herd.  Some of these horses have been maintained at the Bartlesville facility for approximately 18 years. Objective - The Bureau of Land Management anticipates the award of one contract resulting from this Request for Proposals (RFP).  The contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years, with an anticipated award date of May 8, 2003.  The facility must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  Once the facility meets the minimum requirements of the EA and the specifications contained herein, BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility.  This is anticipated to occur within 90 calendar days from the date of award.  No payments shall be made until after animals are received at the facilities, and have resided at the facility for a full one month period.  Contractor(s) will be reimbursed on a per animal feed day basis for the previous month of service.  No advance payments are authorized. Award of a contract constitutes the first delivery order of the contract.  Subsequent orders shall be issued orally by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  The COR will schedule the delivery and pickup of animals with the Contractor. The objectives of this contract are: To maintain the unadopted excess wild horses currently located at the Bartlesville facility in pastures 	large enough to allow free roaming behavior and that can provide the food, water and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in good condition;  To minimize the handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates and corrals; To provide regular, on the ground monitoring of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; Provide management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desirable forage plants. General Services - The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks. Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain a maximum of 2,350 wild horses to graze in pastures.  The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, or when other circumstances warrant); Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis; Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility; Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition; Provide regular monitoring (at least once a week) of horses on site and a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of observations; Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information, such as its overall condition, death, etc.  The records shall be made available for duplication within 5 days after a request is made by the COR and/or PI; Dispose of the remains of dead horses.  The contractor may be required, after consultation with the COR and/or PI or a designated representative, to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain. Specific Services - Handling and Gathering - In the event that animals are transported to the facility, they will normally arrive at the site in trailer loads of approximately 35-40 head per load.  The contractor will provide a telephone number where they can be reached 24 hours per day for scheduling shipments.  BLM will attempt to schedule shipments for daytime arrival.  However, horses shall be unloaded immediately, regardless of arrival time.  The contractor will unload, sort by age, and condition, if determined to be appropriate by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Project Inspector (PI), into various groups; All horses shall be handled, treated and maintained in a humane manner.  Horses in corrals and chutes shall be worked in a manner that minimizes excitement of the horses to prevent injuries from crowding or trampling; Gathering or movement of horses from pastures shall be done with the concurrence of the COR and/or PI, except in emergency conditions, when the contractor determines an immediate gather or movement is necessary for the safety and welfare of the horses.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours after such movement.  Handling of the horses will be kept to a minimum. However, it may be necessary to move the horses from one pasture to another because of range management practices. Corral Facility - Corrals may be permanent or temporary (portable panels).  The corrals will be used to receive horses (if needed) and to prepare horses for shipment at the end of the contract.  It is not anticipated that the horses will have to be gathered otherwise.  The corrals must be at least 72 inches high and made of stoutly constructed material, i.e., pipe, steel, lumber, etc.  Any corral constructed of mesh wire (openings no larger than 2 inches x 4 inches) must be equipped with at least 3 wood sight boards (2 inches x 8 inches) located on the upper portion of the fence.  The three sight boards shall be spaced no more than 12 inches apart. Corrals constructed of pipe or wood must have openings of not more than 12 inches between horizontal members. Corral gates shall be constructed of wood or pipe, at the same height as the fences. Gates shall be visible to the horses, either from the materials used in construction, or by using materials such as plywood or plastic mesh placed on the gates; Two sorting corrals, each with a minimum of 3,600 square feet (60 feet X 60 feet), shall be provided; One holding corral, with a minimum of 6,000 square feet (75 feet X 80 feet), shall be provided. Unloading and Working Facility - The facility shall have a loading and unloading chute, sufficient to safely unload and load semi trailer trucks and small stock trailers.  The chute may either be permanent or temporary.  In order to load horses at the site, a crowding pen and runway at least 36 feet long and 28 inches to 32 inches wide will be required.  Fences shall be a minimum of 72 inches high, stoutly constructed and made of lumber, pipe, or steel. Fences - Pasture perimeter and division fences shall meet State and/or local fence standards for height and spacing between vertical and horizontal members and construction materials.  If determined by the COR and/or PI, flagging may be required on certain fences, with 8 inch flagging attached to the top horizontal member of the fence, every 20 feet, so that the horses can see a fence.  Gates, rather than cattle guards, shall be used at all fence openings to keep horses in pastures. 	Pastures - The facility shall have sufficient land and forage initially to sustain a maximum of 2,350 wild horses. Pastures shall be of sufficient size to allow horses freedom of movement and exercise necessary for good health and to continue their free roaming behavior.  Pastures shall be free of hazards such as unfenced paved public highways.  If pastures are noncontiguous, they shall be managed as separate units, with the maximum number of units being four (4).  Horses shall not be moved from one unit to another except under extraordinary conditions and with the permission of the COR and/or PI.  The maximum allowable distance between units is fifty (50) miles; Sufficient land and forage shall be made available for the number of horses maintained.  However, as the herd is reduced by mortality, pastures may be converted to domestic livestock use by the contractor, provided the use does not interfere with the wild horses.  Stocking domestic horses adjacent to or with the wild horses is unacceptable; The available standing vegetation in pastures must be of sufficient nutritive quality and quantity to maintain the horses in good condition.  Good condition is described as follows: ribs cannot be visually distinguished, but can be easily felt; backbone is not visible; hip bones do not show; withers are distinguishable but do not protrude; shoulders and neck blend smoothly into the body; The stocking rate for the site shall be adjusted as necessary to assure horses are maintained in good condition, as described above; Shelter from the natural elements shall be provided in each pasture by the topography (e.g., canyons, hills, etc.), other natural features such as trees, or manmade structures. Supplemental Feed - Supplemental feed (primarily hay) shall be available at the site to feed the horses in case of drought, fire, deep snow, ice storms, or other unforeseen events.  Supplemental feed shall be of such quality and fed in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.  Supplemental feed shall not be fed to individual horses in declining health because of age and other natural causes.  Hay used as supplemental feed shall have a protein content of no less than 10 percent, be leafy, green, well cured, properly stored and free of dust, most, or heating, and be free of any Russian Thistle or prickly herb, "Cheat" grass, and any other weed or grass not considered healthy forage for domestic animals. Feed Requirements - A good quality, grass/legume hay shall be fed to and made available in sufficient quantity for each animal, with a crude protein not less than 10 percent.  Animals shall be fed at least 2.5 percent of body weight per day.  The COR may test hay to verify quality; Inclement weather will stress animals, requiring that the volume of feed be increased to maintain their body flesh. Water, Minerals, and Salt - Each pasture shall have reliable water sources capable of supplying 16 gallons of clean water per horse, per day.  The maximum distance to water in any pasture shall be 4 miles; Granulated, rock, or block salt shall be accessible to all horses in each pasture; Minerals necessary to maintain the horses in good condition and that are deficient in the available forage in the care unit shall be provided to all horses in each pasture, either as a supplement or added to the salt. Deaths and Disposal of Remains - Dead horses shall be identified by freeze number and physical description, and disposed of in accordance with State and/or local sanitation laws.  Rendering plants may be used for carcass disposal provided no compensation is received by any agency or individual disposing of the remains.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI, or designated representative immediately if the death of a horse is suspicious and it appears that a postmortem examination should be performed by a veterinarian.  The COR and/or PI shall hire a veterinarian and make the arrangements for this procedure. Observation of Horses - The wild horses shall be observed by the contractor at a minimum of one (1) time per week, and more frequently when conditions warrant, i.e., during flooding, tornados, and the fire seasons, to ascertain their safety and well being and assure that fences are properly maintained.  Except in emergency situations, observations shall be carried out on foot, from a vehicle, or horseback.  In unusual situations, such as deep snow, etc., which make ground transportation impractical, aircraft may be used, with the prior approval of the COR and/or PI.  Records that document, as a minimum, the date of the observation, condition of the horses, problems and concerns of the observer, and the name(s) of individual(s) making the observation shall be maintained.  Any problems or concerns shall be reported to the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of discovery. Access to the Facility - Access to the unloading and loading chute shall accommodate both sedans with trailers and semitrucks. Access shall be available during inclement weather. Observation bar the Public - The site is not intended to be a public viewing area.  Therefore, the contractor will restrict or prohibit access onto the site by the general public; The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of any request from human organizations or wild horse interest groups, to observe the horses.  All such organizations and groups shall be allowed to tour the site only under the approval and guidance of the COR and/or PI; All requests to view the animals shall be directed to the COR AND/OR PI. Records - An inventory that identifies all horses delivered to the site shall be kept at the facility.  A record shall be kept on the location (pasture) each horse occupies.  Each horse will be identified with a 4 digit freeze number on the hip, along with an angle freeze mark on the left side of the neck.  Horses that die shall be identified as soon as possible and noted on the inventory.  Probable cause of death shall also be noted. Upon request by the COR and/or PI, the record shall be made available within 5 days for duplicating. Responsibilities of BLM -  Veterinary Care - The BLM will provide and pay for a veterinarian to treat sick or injured horses, as deemed necessary by the COR and/or PI.  The veterinarian may be used to perform euthanasia on horses and conduct postmortem examinations as requested by the COR and/or PI.  The contractor may be required to assist the veterinarian. Farrier Services - The COR and/or PI will determine if horses should have their feet trimmed.  BLM will make the arrangements and hire a farrier if trimming is needed.  The contractor shall gather the horses needing trimming and assist the farrier. This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation NAR080064, which will be available at http://www.fbo.gov on or about March 19, 2008. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<CONTACT>Robin Swatloski, Contracting Officer, Phone XXX-XXX-XXXX, Email PS08-02@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals to develop an extended duration hypersonic testbed known as Blackswift.  The Government seeks development of a reusable hypersonic testbed that utilizes an integrated air-breathing propulsion system.  This reusable testbed will be used to conduct a vigorous flight test campaign in which key enabling technologies are demonstrated and the operational envelope is incrementally expanded in successive flights.  The testbed shall take-off and land under its own power using a conventional runway.  The ultimate flight demonstration shall consist of a powered take-off, climb and acceleration to a Mach 6+ cruise speed, sustain this Mach 6+ cruise speed in level flight for at least 60 seconds, demonstrate maneuverability by executing an aileron roll and land under its own power. The Blackswift flight test program will consist of three Phases.  Phase I will consist of preliminary design and risk reduction activities culminating with a Preliminary Design Review (PDR).  Phase II will consist of detailed design, component maturation and system integration including subsystem verification testing, flight test planning and will culminate with a Critical Design Review (CDR).  Testbed fabrication and flight testing will be accompished in Phase III. The Blackswift flight test program is pursing development and demonstration of near-term (2012) capability.  The Government is soliciting original conceptual flight testbed design approaches from the aerospace community that meet or exceed these objectives.

<CONTACT>Sarah J. Welch Contract Specialist 3608547220     Sarah_Welch@nps.gov;
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This project consists of the design, fabrication and delivery of a 60' long  6'- 6" wide  hiker/stock bridge that spans Agnes Creek on the Pacific Crest Trail.  An existing 39' long timber ramp provides access to the north end of the bridge.  NPS personnel will remove this ramp and replace it in kind, but modify it so that the interior timber bent (which supports the north end of the bridge) is constructed of weathering steel.  The design, fabrication and delivery of this bent is part of the contracted project.  This structure is to replace a timber truss bridge built in 1950 and destroyed by a falling tree in 2007. Because of the age and potential cultural significance of the structural elements embodied in the previous bridge it is important that the new bridge have a similar appearance to the previous structure (using weathering steel trusses instead of timber trusses).  The finished bridge location is on the Pacific Crest Trail, Agnes Creek crossing, in the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area of North Cascades National Park Service Complex.  The bridge site is approximately 10 miles from Stehekin, Washington and  mile by trail from the Stehekin Valley Road.  There is no road or mechanized equipment access to the bridge site.  It is anticipated that NPS will use a helicopter transport the bridge components from a nearby helispot to the bridge site.  The model of helicopter to be used has not been determined, and therefore the lifting capacity is unknown. The contractor will not be responsible for transportation of the components to the bridge site, the installation of the bridge, nor the wood and timber elements (e.g. decking and railing). The contractor's work ends with the delivery of all structural components to the National Park Service in Chelan, WA.  SOLICITATION DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement open to certified HUBZone small business concerns.  The NAICS code for this project is 332312 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The electronic Request for Quotations will be available on approximately March 5, 2008, at www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov. In order to download the solicitation, interested vendors must register at  http://ideasec.nbc.gov and maintain an active registration at http://www.ccr.gov.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE 27 Feb 2008 The HRC2 Program Management Office (554 ELSG/PNK), 550 C Street West, Suite C-355, Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas 78150, hereby formally announces the intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to Diversified Technical Services Incorporated (DTSI) for the continued sustainment of Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and the Defense Integrated Military Human Resource System (DIMHRS) Requirements Analysis for one month with 3 option months to allow for completion of the Personnel Service Delivery Transformation - Strategic Partnership source selection.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Air Force intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.405-6(b)(2) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFARS) Part 208.405-70.    This requirement is a logical follow on effort and DTSI is the only source capable of providing the services due to the avoidance of duplication of costs, negative impact to PSDT-SP award schedule, and increased PSDT-SP program risk.  Due to the limited 30 day basic period of performance and the requirement complexity it is not feasible to compete and transition this effort to a new contractor prior to PSDT-SP transition in April 08.  Competing this effort would result in increased risk and increased cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition.  Continuation of these services with the preservation of process knowledge of the incumbent contractor workforce is essential to achieve AF/A1's transformational objectives defined in the PSDT-SP Statement Of Objectives (SOO).  To compete these services now during the PSDT-SP source selection would significantly impact the PSDT-SP program.  Currently, services are required for one month only, but three optio!  n months are included in case there is a delay in awarding the PSDT-SP contract.  If required, options would only be exercised one month at a time.   This contract will provide support to transition existing DTSI contractor workload associated with the systems analysis and implementation of administrative or business oriented applications, participate in software testing and acceptance, and apply standard business and data manipulation principles and methods to arrive at automated solutions.  This effort provides technical support to Air Force Personnel Operations Agency (AFPOA)/DPXR to incorporate functional requirements into the Air Force Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and other Personnel Data Systems (PDS). This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested persons that identify to the Contracting Officer their intent and capabilities to satisfy the Government's requirement and are received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For specific questions, please contact the Contracting Officer, Mr. David M. Bailey, Phone 210-565-1272, e-mail: david.m.bailey@randolph.af.mil.  In addition, an ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting the Ombudsman, concerned parties !  should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution. The ESC Ombudsman is the ESC Chief of Staff, and can be contacted at: ESC/CS, Bldg 1606, 9 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731; Telephone #: 781-377-5106; Facsimile #: 781-377-4659; jkl  bnmE-Mail: ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 611310   THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT, NOT AN RFQ.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Change Division (CCD) intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures  to Oregon State University of Corvallis, OR.  The purpose of this acquisition is to support the development of a US public forest lands module for FASOM-GHG that allows endogenous determination of public forest management. Oregon State University is  uniquely qualified to perform this work as no other organization has the first-hand economic modeling experience and capability due to their principal model development role in the forestry component of the Forestry and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model + Greenhouse Gases (FASOM-GHG).   FASOM-GHG is the primary analytical tool of EPA's Climate Change Division for evaluating the GHG emissions and mitigation potential of US agriculture and forestry.  FASOM-GHG enables comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the domestic economic welfare and GHG emission/carbon sequestration responses  of competing forest and agricultural mitigation options and practices to alternative carbon equivalent emission policies.  The FASOM-GHG model is unique because it incorporates refined representations of key factors and linkages required for valid GHG emissions mitigation analysis, notably critical  production and demand factors, relationships between sectors, and full GHG accounting for the US agriculture and forestry sectors.  Oregon State University has initiated and led model development of the forestry components of the FASOM model for almost two decades that has resulted in the current  FASOM-GHG model.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if  received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions  should be directed to Lorraine Lesieur via email at lesieur.lorraine@epa.gov  AND Debbie Miller at miller.debbie@epa.gov .  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

Period of performance:  March 15, 2008, or date of award whichever is later, through September 30, 2008.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) held a conference entitled "Gene-Nutrition and Gene-Physical Activity Interactions in the Etiology of Obesity" on September 24-25, 2007. The conference goal was to focus on novel research that integrates genes, eating/preferences and physical activity behaviors as it relates to obesity risk. The workshop convened leading scientists to evaluate our current understanding of the interactions between genes and behavior in the etiology of obesity, and identify the most pressing research needs.  The presentations from the workshop shall be published in the National Association for the Study of Obesity (NAASO) journal supplement, which is published by Nature Publishing Group.

The purpose of this procurement is to cover the publication of a special Obesity journal supplemental issue resulting from presentations given at the "Gene-Nutrition and Gene-Physical Activity Interactions in the Etiology of Obesity" conference.  

The contractor shall handle all graphics, sub-edit of all manuscripts, full typeset, copyedit, paper, bind, post, and mail the supplement to subscribers. The contractor shall provide one set of full proofs and produce the supplement in a period no greater than 12 weeks after the submission for production.

The aforementioned makes them uniquely qualified to fulfill the government's requirement.  This Journal is the most prestigious of all obesity journals and has an extensive readership throughout the obesity community. Nature Publishing Group has the background and staff to complete the work on time and on budget.  Therefore, for the reasons listed above, it would be in the best interest of the government to use this contractor because of its availability to perform these tasks in a cost-efficient and timely manner, thus saving money while producing a high impact journal supplement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Michelle Maldonado, 301-619-7431
<DESC>Under the Authority of FAR 6.302-1, its the Government's intent to award a Sole Source to Ortho Clinical Diagnositics, 100 Indigo Creek Drive, Rochester, NY 14626 for the purchase of Reagents and Disposables for an ECi Analyzer and two Vitros 250 Ana lyzers.  Failure to procure the Reagents and Disposables from Ortho Clinical Diagnositics would void the warranties on the current analyzers, which would halt any research currently being done and stop work in the laboratory all together.  This is not a fo rmal Solicitation.  No Solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this p roposed contract based on this notice is solely within the descretion of the Government.  The Formal J&A for Other Than Full and Open Competition is added below.  Detailed capabilities, proposal, or quote must be submitted to the following email address no  later than 9:00 AM Eastern Standard Time, 17 March 2008.  EMAIL: michelle.maldonado@amedd.army.mil.  <BR><BR>Below is the Formal J&A for Other Than Full and Open Competition for your Review:  <BR><BR><BR>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competit ion<BR><BR>1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity. The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity is responsible this procurement in support of requirements for the Clinical Laboratory at USAMRIID, Ft. Detrick, Frederick, MD.<BR><BR>2.	D escription of Action:  This approval is being requested for a new Firm-fixed price standing order contract using R&D funds.<BR><BR>3.	Description of Supplies/Services:  The required services involve the purchase of reagents, calibrators, controls, and vari ous consumables from Ortho Clinical Diagnostics to be used by one ECi, serial number 30002727, and three Vitros 250s, serial numbers 25016917, 25016918 and 25016197.  The price of the contract includes for the ECi and for the Vitros 250s for a total of $42 ,632.69.  Additional reagents and consumables may be ordered at the prices included within the supply contract.  The Contract will be for a Base Year and 4 Option Years at equivalent pricing bringing the total possible Contract value to $213,163.45.<BR><BR >4.	Authority Cited:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1 and the FAR citation title is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy age ncy requirements.<BR><BR>5.	Reason for Authority Cited:  The proposed contractor for this action is Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (OCD).  In this instance, the services must be obtained from OCD because use of reagents from other vendors will void warranty an d terms of agreement for the use of the analyzers.  The analyzers have had correlation testing performed and are currently in use in the USAMRIID Clinical Laboratory and in the BSL3 and suites.  Ordering reagents manufactured by OCD but sold by another ven dor would result in the removal of the current analyzers, the purchase and correlation testing of new analyzers at a substantial cost to the Institute.<BR><BR>The ECi reagents shall be delivered on a quarterly basis.  The majority of Vitros 250 reagents an d disposables shall be delivered in 2 shipments every 6 months; the Performance Verifiers and Calibrators shall be delivered in a separate shipment.  <BR><BR>6.   Efforts to Obtain Competition: The requirement will be synopsized for the intent to award a s ole source and all responses received will be considered.  <BR><BR>7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  No effective competition is anticipated.  There is only one source capable of performing these required services on the ECi and Vitros 250.  Based on a check of GSA and open market, Ortho Clinical is the only company that makes these two Analyzers and the subsequent items needed on this procurement.  No effecti ve competition to obtain the needed items is anticipated.<BR><BR>8.	Market Research:  Several vendors sell and distribute OCD products, but the reagents required for the ECi and Vitros 250 analyzers currently in use must be obtained directly from OCD.<BR>< BR>10.	Other facts:  Discuss any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as the following:<BR><BR>a. Procurement history.  Reasonable efforts to retrieve the following items from the computer records, contract files, co mpetition advocate office files or other sources are expected:<BR><BR>		i. Contract numbers and dates of the last several awards.<BR><BR>	W81XWH-06-P-0369 Ortho Clinical Diagnostics GH<BR>	W81XWH-06-P-0138 Vitros 350 Chemistry Analyzers Exchange<BR>	W81XWH -06-P-0354 Supplies for ECi<BR>	W81XWH-07-P-0395 Standing Order for Vitros 250 and ECi<BR>	W81XWH-07-P-0172 Supplies for ECi and Vitros 250<BR>	W81XWH-08-P-0219 Reagents for ECi and Vitros 250<BR><BR>	ii. Competitive status of these actions.<BR><BR>Justifi cations for Other than Full and Open Competition were approved for the 07 & 08 Awards.  The awards were synopsized on FEDBIZOPS.  <BR> <BR>	iii. Authority previously used for less than full and open competition.<BR><BR>FAR Part 6.302-1, Only one responsibl e source and not other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   <BR><BR>iv. If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, a summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an explanation of the results.<BR><BR>No effective competition is anticipated.  There is only one source capable of performing these required services on the ECi and Vitros 250.  The availability on GSA and open market were checked; Ortho Clinical is t he only company that makes these two Analyzers and the subsequent items needed on this procurement.  No effective competition to obtain the needed items is anticipated.  The 07 and 08 Awards were synopsized and no other source responded back to the Intent to award the Sole Source. <BR><BR>v. If any prior award was accomplished by full and open competition, a detailed explanation of the changed circumstances. Not applicable.<BR><BR>vi. An explanation of any unusual patterns which may be revealed by the histo ry, e.g., several consecutive urgent buys.<BR><BR>This requirement has been procured on a sole source base because on other source can satisfy this requirement. <BR><BR>vii. If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, b riefly describe the circumstances justifying the buy and whether there have been any significant changes.<BR><BR>The circumstances surrounding many of the previous buys where the same as this one.  The ECi and Vitros 350 Analyzers were procured a while bac k from Ortho Clinical.  Other companies can provide some of the items needed for the Analyzers, but Ortho Clinical is the only one that can give USAMRIID the Reagents.  If procured from other companies, the warranties on the Analyzers that are constant use  in the laboratory will be voided and it will cost much more money to obtain new Analyzers.  It was felt the economically decision was to procure the needed Reagents from Ortho Clinical.  <BR><BR>b. Acquisition data availability.  Explain why technical dat a packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.  Describe actions taken or planned to remedy this situation.<BR><BR>A sta tement of work suitable for full and open competition cannot be developed for this procurement at this time.  It is not being competed because in order to maint ain      the merit and validity of scientific research and the Analyzers already in the laboratories, there is only one source that can render the service. <BR>						<BR>	c. Unusual and compelling urgency.  When FAR 6.302-2 is cited, provide data, estimate d cost or other rationale to explain the nature and extent of the injury to the Government.  If the delay associated with the requirement for first article testing is the principal reason for not awarding the contract on a full and open basis, clearly desc ribe the reasons that first article testing is required on this procurement and why other means of assuring quality are not being used. Not applicable.<BR><BR>d. Subcontracting competition.  In single source situations, address efforts to be taken by the G overnment to assure that the prime contractor obtains as much competition as possible in its subcontracting. Not applicable.<BR><BR>	11.  Technical Certification:  Include the following statement:<BR><BR>I justify that the supporting data under my cognizan ce which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<BR><BR>Typed Name: Date:  Christa M.

Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:  Include the following determination:<BR><BR>I hereby determine the anticipated cost to the Government fo r this contract action will be fair and reasonable.<BR><BR>Provide the basis for this determination:  The price established for the required services will be determined to be fair and reasonable at the time of award.  It is anticipated the price analysis t echnique of comparing the proposed price with previous prices for same or similar services will be utilized and obtaining a price list could assist with determining that the company is pricing the products fairly.  <BR><BR>Signature:    - Signed - <BR>Type d Name: 	Cheryl R.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has a requirement to contract a research vessel and operator to conduct two research cruises in the Dry Tortugas region of Southwest, FL (SE Gulf of Mexico) in May and June of 2008.  Cruise operations will be conducted over a total of 20 days and will support scuba-based surveys of reef fish, macroinvertebrates, other benthic fauna, and habitat characteristics.  This research will facilitate the (1) assessment of natural system variability versus change result in from implementation of ?no take? spatial management zones recently implemented in the Dry Tortugas region; (2) assessment of correlations between spatially explicit multispecies abundance and biomass data with relevant biophysical structure; and (3) modeling of linkages between coral reef fishery resources and key environmental ?habitat? features.  The contracted vessels shall support the following activities:  Operations shall be conducted in and around the Dry Tortugas near 24.5 degrees North and 083.0 degrees West.  Biological data will be collected by SCUBA divers using non-destructive, in situ, fishery independent visual monitoring methods.  The scientific investigators are uniquely qualified to conduct this research based on past research and experience in the study area.  The proposed sampling survey will obtain about 1500 visual census point samples over a short period to provide a spatially integrated ?snapshot? of the exploited reef fish community three (3) years after Tortugas marine reserves were impacted by several hurricanes.  This work requires a labor-intensive effort with no shortcuts to ensure that sampling is cost-effective and precise.  At a rate of 4-6 reef fish visual census samples per diver per day (depending on depth) a minimum of 20 field days of ship support are required to provide sufficient spatial coverage.  By sampling both in and out of the marine reserves throughout the Tortugas region, science divers will provide:  (1) spatially explicit estimates of population abundance and biomass by size (age) groups for both exploited species essential for quantitative stock assessments; and (2) statistical characterization reef ?habitats? in terms of nursery and population-productivity value.  The estimated dates of cruises are as follows unless both parties agree to changes: May 11, May 12-21, May 22, May 30, May 31-June 9, 2008.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 488390 and size standard is 6.5 million.  All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). For instructions on how to register in CCR and ORCA please access the following web site: http://www.bpn.gov. In order to register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number.  The Central Region Acquisition Division (CRAD), requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

<DESC>This Amendment is issued to answer all questions submitted for Solicitation 6HQOIG-08-A-0004:

QUESTION:
Page 2 of the SOW, under ERM Training asks for "Designing and developing training on ERM". However, on page 3, the third bullet, the RFP states, "The supplier is not expected to provide curricula". Please confirm that offerors are to design and develop the training but not to provide printed handbooks.
ANSWER: The OIG expects offerors to design and develop the training course on ERM, with no expectation that offerors will develop a printed handbook (curricula).  The OIG, however, does expect offerors to develop slides or other computer-assisted methods to present the training material to participants.

QUESTION:
Please confirm that OIG expects AICPA and National Association of State Boards of Accountancy ("NASBA") CPE Standards should be used for determining the CPE compliance and certificates as requested in the last paragraph of Section 4?
ANSWER:
(1)Yes, The OIG expects offerors to use AICPA and National Association of State Boards of Accountancy ("NASBA") CPE Standards for determining the CPE compliance. 
(2)Offerors are expected to provide all necessary information to support OIG prepared training certificates/documentation.  Because this is group training a certificate is not required.  However, sign in sheets MUST be used and credit will only be given to employees who certify they attended training by signing the sign in sheet.  

QUESTION:
On page 5, the total 15 page limit appears to address each Technical Factor (I, II and III). However, on page 6, Factor III, the RFP states two examples can be provided up to 50 pages each. Please confirm these two examples of 50 pages each are outside of the 15 page limit total?
ANSWER:
Yes.  The examples of course training materials are in addition to (or outside of) the 15 page limit requirement.

QUESTION:
Please confirm that resumes are to be considered as part of the 15 page limit for analysis of the technical factors. 
ANSWER:
Yes. The OIG considers resumes to be a part of the 15-page limit for analysis of the technical factors.  In lieu of resumes, offerors can also provide an appropriate summary that demonstrates the qualifications, experience, and abilities of key personnel.  The OIG will consider either method of response (resumes or a summary) as part of the 15-page limit for analysis of the technical factors.

QUESTION:
Page 2 of the SOW under ERM Training, requests designing and developing training on ERM "oriented to an OIG perspective", please confirm that the goal is to provide a basic understanding of ERM.
ANSWER:
Yes.  The ultimate goal of the training is to provide a basic understanding of ERM.  The OIG requires the training to be "oriented to an OIG perspective" simply because participants will better understand ERM if examples and success stories etc. are OIG-related in nature. 

QUESTION:
What are the minimum/maximum hours for the Base Year?  
ANSWER:
Minimum Classes:  2
Maximum Classes:  8
Minimum Consulting Hours:  40
Maximum Consulting Hours:  120

SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES: DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD? The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, ?scrub?) is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or  resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble  Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force  Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew  participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556  ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing  SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision  regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for  implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part  of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to  the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs  being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be  implemented in the Training System.

Description
DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED WORK:  The Government is seeking a qualified contractor to construct a new U.S. Port of Entry, Portal, North Dakota to replace the original border station built in 1932.  POE requires significant expansion and total replacement of the existing facility to meet current safety, security, circulation and efficiency standards.  The work consists of two main phases; Phase I construction services for construction of a new 70,000 gross square foot facility and Phase II construction work consists of a new 10,000 square foot Border Patrol Building and ancillary buildings totaling approximately 29,000 square feet.  Phase I and Phase II construction will increase the site size from 1.5 to 11.5 acres, expanding the current border station inspection lanes and provide other expanded border station functions, incorporating new exit and entry requirements developed by the Department of Homeland Security.  

If negotiations result in a final price for Phase II construction within Congressional funding limits, the Government intends to exercise the option for Phase II construction pending availability of funds.  The statutory limit for funding of the base contract and Phase I options is $18,000,000.  Any offers above that amount will be rejected.  If the negotiation efforts do not render a final price for Phase II construction within available funding, the Government will not exercise the option for Phase II construction.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS




This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE: 

1.   Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.   

Note:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.   

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below: 

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary: 

      (a)        A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.   The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and 

      (b)        Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov/, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and 

      (c)        A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, 

     (d)        A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above. 

2.   Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. 

3.    Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

4.    Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. 

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation. 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments.  Please visit our web page periodically to obtain updated information regarding this procurement.  No individual notifications will be provided to offerors by the EPA. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, NC is responsible for procuring, testing, and distributing filters of high purity to the State and Local air pollution control agencies.  The agency has a requirement for glass fiber and quartz filters.  The quartz filters are used with a Size Selective Sampler (SSI) to collect PM-10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) samples.  The glass fiber filters are used with a Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) sampler.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks. The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution.  It is important that all filters of the same type from the same delivery contain a uniform level of impurities.  Therefore, the contractor shall manufacture all filters for a delivery from the same sheet material using a single production line and one production run.  As part of the solicitation requirements, the Government intends to require offerors to submit 50 glass fiber filters and 50 quartz filters with their proposal. These samples will be tested to ensure the offerors' capabilities to produce acceptable filters. EPA anticipates the award of  a sixty (60)-month, fixed price requirements type contract with orders issued on an as-needed basis at any time during any of the five (5) twelve (12)-month ordering periods.   NAICS Code No. 334516 applies, with a size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is a follow-on to contract EP-D-05-014 with Whatman, Inc. which expired December 31, 2006.  The solicitation is expected to be issued approximately December 14, 2007 as a full and open competition.  Proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) days after issuance of the solicitation.   The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Firms are encouraged to access the solicitation and amendments via Internet.  If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments.  Telephone and fax requests will not be honored.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. EPA Point of Contact:  Otelia Newsome, (919) 541-3164

<SUBJECT>99 -- USAF Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling Pilot Program
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FFS-AR-XR001
<RESPDATE>032808
<ARCHDATE>04122008
<CONTACT>Robert Nolin, Contracting Officer, Phone 937-255-6291, Fax 937-255-3466, Email robert.nolin@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI).  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  As proscribed in the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act, the Air Force is in the process of implementing a fee-for-service aerial refueling (FFS/AR) pilot program as a complement to existing Air Force organic capability.  The purpose of the pilot program is to assess the feasibility and utility of incorporating commercial service provider(s) in Air Force operations long-term.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market research effort being conducted by Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) to determine potential sources capable of providing this fee-for-service aerial refueling service.  Under the pilot program, each service provider refueling aircraft must be able to off-load fuel utilizing centerline flying boom equipment and a probe and drogue system.  The latter may be satisfied by one or both of: 1) centerline hose/drogue equipment; 2) multi-point hose/drogue equipment (i.e. wingtip refueling pods).  No developmental funding is available to capitalize or establish sources capable of providing this service.  Respondents should also assume that no government furnished property will be available to establish any commercial aerial refueling capability (such as excess KC-135 aircraft or spare aerial refueling components such as center-line booms).  The government is interested in identifying sources of commercial-off-the-shelf aerial refueling services that are or will be capable of initiating performance in the FY09/10 timeframe.  Potential sources should include their size status for NAICS code 481212.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research.  This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only.  Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of these questions or to otherwise pay for the information you provide.  Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  This information will be used to assist in developing the acquisition strategy.  Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.

The government may award contracts for concept refinement studies if more detailed information on fee-for-service aerial refueling is needed based on responses to this RFI.  The concept refinement studies may be awarded through the Broad Area Announcement (BAA) process.  If concept refinement studies are needed, they will be synopsized approximately two months from the date of this announcement.

As set forth in the FY08 NDAA, the pilot program will be not less than five years.  Multiple contractors may be selected to participate in the pilot program.  The pilot program will not exceed more than two aerial refueling aircraft per provider.  The pilot program may encompass and/or evaluate the following missions as directed in the FY08 NDAA:  testing support, training support to receiving aircraft, homeland defense support, deployment support, air bridge support, aeromedical evacuation, and emergency air refueling.  Additional missions may be incorporated as Air Force requirements are established.

In responding to this RFI, the government is specifically interested in receiving the following information from interested FFS/AR providers.  Information collected will be used to assist the government in drafting its requirements and establishing its acquisition strategy for the pilot program.

1)	Describe your ability to acquire/develop/operate/certify aerial refueling aircraft equipped with both flying boom-type and multi-point probe and drogue fuel delivery systems in light of the desired FY09/10 pilot program initiation date;

2)	Describe your current or planned capability to hire/train/certify personnel qualified to perform/sustain the aerial refueling service (including flying boom operators);

3)	What are the minimum and maximum allowable annual flying hours you could provide as a FFS/AR pilot program provider?

4)	Identify any anticipated legal/indemnification/insurance issues the government might encounter in utilizing FFS AR from your firm; 

5)	Describe your knowledge of and your capability to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification (to include parts 91, 121, and 125), and public-use certification for the military air refueling issues for CONUS and outside CONUS operations; 

6)	Describe the potential costs-to-the-government of utilizing your commercial fee-for-service program that would not be captured in the pilot program's pricing.  Specifically the government is interested in the potential liabilities it might face at the completion of the pilot program if commercial FFS/AR is not continued with your firm.

7)	Describe your firm's experience in performing in conjunction with Air Mobility Command operations and your organizations ability to integrate its operations (existing or planned) with those of AMC.

8)	In order to reduce the impact to current refueling fleet training during the pilot program, we are interested in proposed billing concepts that enable receiving aircraft to pay for services through their respective flying hour program, versus using existing refueling aircraft flying hour funding.  Describe your capability to utilize this type of billing procedure.

9)	Describe your firm's current or planned capability to collect the following data for the pilot program as directed by Section 1081 of the 2008 NDAA:
(a) Missions flown;
(b) Mission areas supported;
(c) Receiver aircraft number, type, model series refueled;
(d) Fuel dispensed;
(e) Departure reliability rates;

10)	Describe any other fee-for-service program efforts you may have had with the U.S. Government for aerial refueling or other air transport services.     If any, please state your last commitment.
a)	Type of service provided
b)	Date(s) of service provided
c)	Government point of contact (name, phone number, e-mail address)

11)	Identify the quantity, size and type of aerial refueling equipment organic to your company at the present time.

12)	Are your company's existing or planned aircraft or AR equipment owned or leased?

13)	Are your personnel currently qualified to provide aerial refueling services of the types contemplated above?

14)	If not, describe your firm's plans to ensure they are qualified and provide your concept to maintain aircrew proficiency. 

15)	What percentage of your company's assets or fleet will be dedicated to USAF support during the pilot program?

16)	What is your expected turn around time for providing aerial refueling mission support to AMC (i.e. time between sorties)?

17)	What is the location of your present/planned operating locations for AR services?

18)	How much advance notification is required to meet AMC AR mission tasking requirements under the pilot program?

19)	Request you supply the Air Force with a copy of your company's portfolio (e.g., balance sheet, income statement and statement of retained earnings).

20)	Provide company point(s) of contact, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and company status (i.e., small business, HUBZone business, etc.).
Responses submitted should be one copy and must be received by 28 March 2008.  In the interest of economy, request submissions be limited to approximately 50 pages.  The response to question 19 is not included in this limit.  Request for Information responses may be submitted electronically or regular mail, but require both electronic and hard copies of responses.   Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size in accordance with the size standard; ensure that the company name, address, a point of contact with e-mail address and telephone number, Federal CAGE Code, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.   No collect calls will be accepted.  Responses should be sent to ASC/XR, (Eric Crawford), 2145 Monahan Way, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433-7017.     Questions should be directed to Mr. Eric Crawford at 937-255-2649, email eric.crawford@wpafb.af.mil.

The Government extends an invitation to potential prime contractors for the Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling pilot program to present capabilities briefings in person the week of 14 April 2008.  These face-to-face sessions will be limited to two hours each and will be conducted at Wright-Patterson AFB OH.  Firms interested in scheduling a face-to-face session should contact the above point of contact for available times.  The government will not be able to provide industry with information on any future Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling request for proposal during these sessions as more detailed requirements documents do not yet exist.

System shall be capable of dispo sing of numerous types of solid waste to include wood, paper, cardboard, food, plastic, sanitary, clinical and oil waste.  As a threshold, system must be capable of destroying 4000 pounds of solid waste per day; the approximate solid waste amount generated  by a typical Force Provider Module (600 soldiers).  As an objective we are seeking the ability to provide a form of energy reclamation from the destruction of solid waste.  Solid waste disposal system must fit within no more than two, 20 ISO containers, each weighing less than 10,000 pounds (gross).   If energy recovery is possible an additional two, 20 ISO containers can be used (four total ISO containers, each weighling less than 10,000 pounds gross) and also must weigh not more than 10,000 pounds (gro ss).  Method of proposed solid waste disposal needs to be explained in detail, all methods are of interest; however, the system must conform to both European and U.S. acceptable standards for gaseous emissions and/or any other applicable environmental regu lations governing liquid and/or solid waste products.  PM FSS is not soliciting for concepts, prototypes, or systems in early development.  The system must currently be available and be capable of being put into an operational environment immediately with minimal development.  Information should include available technology, product literature and illustrations, and relevant company background/experience and must be received within NLT 30 calendar days of this publication date.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT WILL BE THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement type contract for the effort described herein. SCOPE OF WORK: This solicitation for research proposals is offered under the auspices of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP).  NOPP is a collaboration of fifteen Federal agencies to provide leadership and coordination of national oceanographic research and education programs.  This solicitation directly addresses two of five elements of the NOPP Investment Strategy that represent emerging national ocean research needs and agency priorities Operational/Routine Observations and Outreach/Education).  Both Minerals Management Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration?s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research will be collaborating agencies with separately-funded companion studies conducted by U.S. Geological Survey.  This interagency study will focus on the exploration and investigation of deepwater non-chemosynthetic biological communities in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) that have developed on both natural and artificial hard substrates including platforms and shipwrecks with emphasis on deepwater coral habitats.  An additional aspect includes exploration of unidentified shipwreck sites in the deep Gulf with both historical and biological objectives.  Although the vast majority of the bottom in deepwater areas of the GOM is comprised of soft sediments (mixtures of sand, silt, and clay), it is increasingly well known that there are numerous locations with significant areas of hard bottom, particularly associated with the tops and flanks of salt diapirs and associated faulting.  The vast majority of these deepwater hard bottom habitats are unexplored and their biological communities poorly understood.  Hard bottom substrates can be colonized by diverse assemblages of megafauna in the deep sea; however, organic input, hydrographic characteristics, and other factors are believed to limit distribution of high-density, high-diversity communities.   Deepwater assemblages of scleractinian corals are a particularly significant community type in the deep sea due to their ability to create extensive additional habitat within the structure formed by the coral itself.  Additional types of corals including antipatharians (black corals) and gorgonians (e.g., sea fans) also add significant community structure and potential for high community diversity.  Two major communities that include significant accumulations of Lophelia coral have been reported in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  It is not known if similar remarkable coral habitats are located in other parts of the Gulf or if they are indeed extremely rare.  Past research has clearly demonstrated that deepwater coral habitats are important biodiversity hotspots and significant biological resources with intrinsic and socio-economic value.  These basic discoveries together with increased knowledge of potential threats have highlighted the urgent need to prevent further degradation of these vulnerable habitats.  Although knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of deep-sea coral communities in the northern Gulf of Mexico has increased in the last decade, data are lacking on what regulates the observed patchy distribution and how extensive deep-sea coral banks form.  The oil and gas industry has, and will continue to move into deeper water in their continuing search for extractable energy reserves in the Gulf of Mexico.  Knowledge of the distribution, relative abundance, and population structures of deepwater organisms provides critical information to MMS to estimate the potential effects of deepwater exploration and production and allow refinement of mitigation measures. NOAA OER explores the ocean and maps its resources, to gain new insights about its physical, chemical, biological, and archaeological characteristics, and it?s living and non-living resources and seeks innovative scientific objectives that will bring new discoveries and allow the public to engage in exploration through education and outreach activities connected to expeditions.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS: NATURAL HARDBOTTOM, PLATFORMS AND SHIPWRECKS: A. Natural Hardbottom: (1) To determine environmental conditions that result in the observed distribution of significant high-density hard bottom communities on the continental slope that are sensitive to impacts from oil and gas development activities (especially extensive areas of Lophelia and other corals). Near bottom physical oceanography is an important component; (2) To explore new, previously undocumented hard bottom sites selected through the use of remote sensing data and; (3) To conduct process studies and experimental hypothesis-based studies.  Deepwater coral habitats are the main priority and previously studied deepwater coral habitats shall be included.  B. Platforms: (1) To document biological communities on deep GOM oil and gas structures through direct observation and sample collection and determine to what degree they are serving as artificial reefs with some environmental value. Structures will be selected matching specific criteria of age and water depth; (2) To explore the basic question: Do man-made artificial structures function as artificial reefs in deep water? (3) To investigate deepwater coral colonization including both stony corals and other coral taxa such as antipatharians (?black corals?) and; (4) To gain an understanding of deepwater coral ecology and ecosystem-wide distribution dynamics through analysis of geographic and environmental conditions where deepwater corals are found on platforms and through samples collected for genetic studies, etc.  C. Shipwrecks: (1) To positively identify each vessel investigated and, where possible, establish its type and date of construction, nationality, ownership (past and present), use history, mission and cargo at time of loss; (2) To determine each vessel?s past and present condition and state of preservation; and, through sampling of relevant metals make observations relating to its rate of deterioration; (3) To determine the horizontal extent of the debris field surrounding each site and; (4) To determine potential eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places through archival research and the analysis of imagery and to prepare a National Register nomination form for potentially eligible vessels.  Additional basic biological survey objectives will also be a part of this component with emphasis on coral communities and to assess impacts of biofouling communities to these shipwrecks to determine the stability of these sites.  The period of performance of this study shall be forty-eight (48) months.  The field work is anticipated to occur during the first, second and third years with the remaining time dedicated to analyses, synthesis of results, and completion of all deliverables.  The study area is the region of the northern Gulf of Mexico continental slope below a depth of 300 m.  The estimated cost of this study is between $2,480,000 and $3,340,000.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration?s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research (NOAA OER) may provide, at no cost to the Offeror, up to 22 days of field time on the R/V Nancy Foster not including any submergence facilities in early September 2008 and a similar number of days of field time including research vessel and submergence facilities such as an Remotely Operated Vehicle for the 2009 and 2010 field years.  This study consists of ten (10) main tasks: (1) selection of a Scientific Review Group; (2) refinement of hypotheses, field methodologies and logistics; (3) coordination with U.S. Geological Survey efforts (conducting concurrent collaborative studies); (4) site selection; (5) field sampling; (6) conduct a deepwater Gulf of Mexico commercial fishing review; (7) sample and data analysis; (8) data interpretation, synthesis and reporting; (9) development of educational outreach materials; and (10) interaction with international marine life database organizations. No proposal that offers less than the total required effort will be considered for award.   HOW TO RESPOND: For a full copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP), please contact Mary Coleman via email at mary.coleman@mms.gov  Please include in your request the RFP Number M08PS00019 and title ?Exploration and Research of Northern Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Natural and Artificial Hard Bottom Habitats with Emphasis on Coral Communities: Reefs, Rigs and Wrecks?, your organizations name, point of contact, Dun & Bradstreet number, address, telephone and fax numbers and email address.

U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to Waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing.
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing.
According to the request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Pamela M. McClam, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Pamela M. McClam, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 205-205-7408; by FAX at (202) 481-4783; or by email at Pamela.McClam@sba.gov 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.? 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR ?121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA?s regulations at 13 CFR ?121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding system.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing.
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 335999 product number 6210. 
The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportunities.

<DESC>A.	General Information:
The Northeast, Mid-Atlantic & Heartland Regions collectively referred to as Logistical Support Area (LSA) North, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard medical treatment facilities (MTF?s) in the states of states of Maryland, Virginia, New York, Washington D.C., Delaware, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky  announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of Advanced Wound Care Products. This product line includes, but is not limited to of Hydrocolloid Dressings, Silver Dressings, Foam Dressings, and Moisture Vapor Permeable Film.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the regions based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. A single selection is intended in this project; however, the LSA North acknowledges the possibility of a multiple selection if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the regions. 
 
The 9 Military Treatment Facilities (MTF?s) that will be participating in this standardization initiative are:  Northeast Region ? Andrews AFB, MD, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington DC, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD. Mid-Atlantic Region-Langley AFB, VA, Pope AFB, NC, Ft Bragg, NC, Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, VA, Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, NC. Heartland Region-Wright Patterson Air Force Base Medical Center, OH.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, (DSCP) Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) AND A separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor(s) for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items.  This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is NOT a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime Vendor program please access the web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil
.    
The Heartland Region has been designated as the Lead TRBO for this standardization action. 

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of  2 years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3)12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Anticipated selection date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria. A single selection is intended in this project; however, the LSA North acknowledges the possibility of a multiple selection if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the regions. The Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIA?s.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  

Point of Contact is Phyllis Targett, (937) 257-9075, phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil.

This board includes clinicians and logisticians from MTF?s in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, & Heartland Regions.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative. 

 The Regions intend to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTF?s in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I ? Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their ?intent to participate? to the above POC by the required response date. All e-mail communication should be digitally signed. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.    Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and by the Clinical Product Team to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed

Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor for the regions (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

 Technical/Company Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted technical/company criteria outlined below:
1.	Vendors must provide a complete line (cut-to-fit and various forms and sizes) of Advanced Wound Care products.   At a minimum, this includes Hydrocolloid Dressings, Silver Dressings, Foam Dressings, Moisture Vapor Permeable Film, Hydrogels, and  Alginates. Provide certification of all itemized brand(s) and styles that are manufactured and/or distributed for Advanced Wound Care products with the initial submittal.	
2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Advanced Wound Care product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Products must be available through the current Prime Vendor, Owens & Minor.  Provide documentation to support with initial submittal. .  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note that vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.). Where lower Federal Supply Schedule prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent discounts off the DAPA.
5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic excel format upon request.
6.	At a minimum, vendors must provide a standard industry warranty and submit evidence of their policy with their initial submittals.    
7.	Vendors must provide products that meet the industry production and safety standards (FDA, ISO) used in manufacturing Advanced Wound Care products and must provide these standards and the independent studies and efficacy test results that certify that your products meet these standards with their initial submittals.
8.	Products must be in packaging that can be delivered to a sterile field. Please provide evidence with the initial submittal
9.  Vendors must identify if company has history of backorders and /or recalls in the past two  
     (2) years for the product  line. Explaining the a) dates and duration, b) cause, c) resolution.   
     Vendors should provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations, and  
      any relief of resolution which may have been provided, since there will be no further   
      opportunity to explain these scenarios and their effects.
          10.  Vendors must identify what kind of educational tools or materials are available for this 
      product line. Vendors should provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these      
      situations, and any relief of resolution which may have been provided since there will be  
      no further opportunity to explain these scenarios and their effects.
          11    Products must be latex free/safe and be clearly labeled as such on all 
                  exterior and interior packaging including the individual items. Identify all such products  
                  and labeling with the initial submittal
         12.   To support this multi-regional effort please identify how the local reps are assigned (by 
                 region, by facility, by state, etc.).with the initial submittal.
         13.   Vendors must identify if a clinical application/product recommendation chart is available. If  
                 so please include one copy in an electronic form such as a PDF file.

1.	Phase II ? Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team (CPT) formed by the TPRB will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTF?s and will be allowed 3 weeks (21 calendar days) from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF?s by COB, 5PM EST, on the (21st)  calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and anticipated delivery date. The samples to be provided are as follows:
Hydrocolloid Dressing:
4X4 Regular thickness-10 samples each facility
4X4 Extra-Thin-10 samples each facility.
Silver Dressings:
10X12-10 samples to each facility
1X12 Strips-10 samples to each facility
Foam Dressings:
5X5 Adhesive-10 samples to each facility
5X5 Non-Adhesive-10 samples to each facility
Moisture Vapor Permeable Film:
5 ? X4 Framed-10 samples to each facility
5 ? X4 Unframed-10 samples to each facility

  
Specific MTF?s will evaluate the clinical/performance. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert-like format with a 1-5 scoring scale. The scale descriptors are: 1=strongly disagree,  
2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. N/A=non-applicable. The CPT has 
established a target threshold of 3.75 for the clinical acceptability of these products for 
Standardization. The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near the 3.75  
depending on the ?break? in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near 
the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.75. Subject to this review, products below the 
threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for 
standardization.

To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT  
validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: 
 
      Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.75
Hydrocolloid:
1. Products are easily cut into various sizes and shapes-(wounds are
   different sizes and shapes and clinicians will need to cut the products to fit).
2. Removal of product does not damage skin-(when removing the product
   do not want to damage the skin or wound).
3. Product adheres to skin without rolling edges-(this product should
    stay in place at least 7 days-if edges roll this will cause it to peel off too soon).
4. Product applies smoothly to skin-(the smoother the product
    applies, the less chance for wrinkles)
5. Product is easy to apply-(when you are applying wearing gloves it
    should be easy to apply and not stick to the clinician and easy to peel off backing)
     Silver Dressings:
1.  Removal of product does not traumatize the wound-(when removing
     the product you do not want to remove any new tissue)
2.  Product does not fall apart during use-(if the product falls apart it is difficult to remove from   
     wound and could be retained in wound indefinitely).
3. Product handles drainage from application site without macerating or desiccating the patient's   
    tissue (macerated/desiccated tissue impedes wound healing)
     Foam Dressings:
 1.  Product is easily cut into various sizes and shapes-(wounds are different sizes and shapes and              
      clinicians will need to cut the products to fit).
 2. Product molds easily to difficult areas-(this type dressing is used on areas like the elbow, 
     coccyx, and other areas that are not flat-product needs to conform to that shape).
 3.  Product remains intact and will not swell when saturated-(some expanding of this type dressing 
      is expected but if it swells too much will put extra pressure on the new tissue)
    Moisture Vapor Permeable Film:
 1.  Product can be applied without wrinkling-(if dressing sticks to itself and is wrinkled it no longer  
      provides a moisture-proof barrier)
2.	Product maintains a seal to prevent fluid leakage-(if fluid leaks out it creates an  environment  
    for  contamination of the wound)
3.	Product can be removed without damage to the skin-( when removing the product do not want 
to damage the new tissue or existing skin)

9.	Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process. Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Lead TRBO and results will be forwarded to the all participating TRBO?s for the TPRB?s final review. After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.75 threshold (depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 2 weeks (14 calendar days) to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM  EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent discounts off the DAPA.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.  

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for 2 years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3)12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  

A multiple selection is a possibility in this LSA North standardization initiative in the event that no single vendor meets the total requirements of LSA North as a whole for any or all products.  The selection of a standardized vendor or vendors is based upon the clinical/performance evaluation and a Best Value decision with pricing being secondary to the clinical/performance evaluation.  Each individual Region may select a vendor or vendors based upon their respective clinical/performance evaluations, their respective best value decisions, and respective TPRB recommendations.

<DESC>A.	 General Information

     The Heartland Region, TRBO Region 5, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 5 Army, Navy, and Air Force, medical treatment facilities in Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of  Surgical Drapes. This product line includes, but is not limited to  U-Drapes, 71X85 Drape Sheets, Three Quarter Drape Sheets, Extremity Drapes, Arthroscopy Drapes with Fluid Control Pouches & Laparotomy Drape Sheets. 

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. A single selection is intended in this project; however, the Heartland Region acknowledges the possibility of a multiple selection if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the region. 
 
The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, and Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky.

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is June 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  

Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Drapes, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $44,835.40. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project include: 3M STERI-DRAPE U-DRAPE: ADHESI 45 Cases/$10,385.24; $3,103.89; DRAPE SHEET, 71 X 85 55 Cases/$4,551.37; PROXIMA THREE QUARTER DRAPE, E 77 Cases/$3,103.89; EXTREMITY DRAPE 86X128  34 Cases/$3,091.49; PROXIMA ARTHROSCOPY SHEET WITH 13 Cases/$3,031.53; PROXIMA LAPAROTOMY DRAPE WITH 29 Cases/$3,026.44; KIMBERLY-CLARK COMPONENTS (STE) 9 Cases/$2,973.39; 3M IOBAN 2 ANTIMICROBIAL INCIS 37 Cases/$2,870.27; 3M STERI-DRAPE IRRIGATION POUC 24 Cases/$2,480.00; KIMBERLY-CLARK COMPONENTS (STE ) 19 Cases/$2,099.01.
 
At the request of the Heartland Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075. Submissions must be received by 5:00 P.M. EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice. Failure of the vendor to meet the submittal deadline will result in exclusion.

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Failure of the vendor to meet the submittal deadline will result in exclusion. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.


D.	 Evaluation Criteria
The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTF?s in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their ?intent to participate? to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. 
Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB  by the Clinical Product Team, to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:
1.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Surgical Drapes product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
2.	Products must be available through the current Prime Vendor, Owens & Minor. Provide documentation to support with initial submittal.
3.	Vendors must identify the brand(s) that your company manufacture and/or distribute your product. . Provide documentation to support with initial submittal.
4.

These must include, but not limited to the American Association of Operating Room Nurses (AORN) standards.  Provide documentation with initial submittal. 
5.	Vendors? products must be latex free/safe.  Provide documentation to support with initial submittal.
6.	Vendors? drapes must  have barrier protection against particulate matter and fluids. Identify if this barrier protection is dependent on the number of layers the fabric has.  List the levels of protection.
7.	The impervious regions of your drapes must be labeled or indicated in some way on the item.  Identify what is the method of labeling or indication.
8.	Vendors must manufacture or distribute a complete line of  drapes for all types of surgical procedures that include but are not limited to the high usage items listed above..  Please provide a complete list by identifying all brands, sizes, and types of your drapes with the initial submittal. 
9.	Vendors drapes must be packaged with labeling that clearly identifies the expiration date. Please confirm
10.	Vendors drapes, (where applicable), must have instrument pads with a non-slip surface   Provide documentation to support with initial submittal.
11.	Vendors? drapes must be labeled/printed with the directions of placement. Provide documentation to support with initial submittal.
12.	Vendors must identify what type of adhesive your company uses for the incision areas of your drapes.
13.	Vendors must identify the ASTM International test method used (and the score) for assessing your drape propensity to lint (i.e., flexing in air, Helmke drum test etc).
14.	Vendors must identify the ASTM International test method used to determine breaking strength for your  drapes (grab or strip tensile strength, burst strength, etc.) and provide the test  result score for your product.
      17. Vendors must identify the ASTM International tear strength test method (and  
            score) used for your drapes.
18.	Vendors must provide information about how your company?s fabrics used in your drapes perform in a surgical fire, i.e., Meets Consumer Product Safety Commission Standard for Flammability of Clothing Textiles (CPSC 16 CFR 1610).
19.	Vendors must provide information on how your company?s drapes are constructed, i.e., spun-lace, spunbond, wet laid  etc?
20.	Vendors must provide the recommended disposal guidelines for your drapes  (If products are incinerated for disposal, what are the potential byproducts?)
21.	Vendors must identify if company has history of backorders and /or recalls for the  product line in the past five (5) years Explaining the a) dates and duration, b) cause, c) resolution. Vendors should provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations, and any relief of resolution which may have been provided, since there will be  no further opportunity to explain these scenarios and their effects.

1.	Phase II ? Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team (CPT) formed by the TPRB will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTF?s and will be allowed 3 weeks (21 calendar days) from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM  EST, on the (21st) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The samples to be provided are as follows:
U Drape (Sterile-Disposable-plastic w/ adhesive around opening) 48 x 52-5 each facility
Drape Sheet (Sterile-Disposable) 71 X 85-5 each facility
? Drape Sheet (Sterile-Disposable-Economy) 53X77- 5 each facility
Extremity Drape (Sterile-Disposable) 89X128-5 each facility
Arthroscopy Drape w/Fluid Control Pouch (Sterile/Disposable)
  
Specific MTF?s will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like scale, with a one to five rating. 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or 3.75 depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.75.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.  

To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting. 
The following equally weighted Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  
Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.75

1. Product size and folding allows item to be easily applied to the operative site  
    (sterile drapes should be handled as little as possible)
2.  Product is flexible enough to conform loosely to the patient?s contour.(flexibility  
     allows the patient to be draped smoothly and closely which allows for placement  
     of surgical instruments on field)  
3.  Product has limited memory (drape stays unfolded and in place when applied).
4.  Product is lint-free during use (lint can contaminate surgical site and increases the  
     chance for infection)
5.  Product does not tear and/or perforate easily during use (tears increase the    
     chance of contaminating the sterile field) 
6.  Product fenestration size is adequate for the type of procedure (allows for easy 
    access to surgical site)
7.  Reinforced areas on the drape prevent strikethrough (critical areas are 
     reinforced). 
8.  The edge of the incision opening has good adhesion (the incision opening will not 
     come loose  if moist or wet).

Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.75 threshold (depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 2 weeks (14 calendar days) to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor, without discussion as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.
The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.

<DESC>A.General Information
The Heartland Region, TRBO Region 5, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 5 Army, Navy, and Air Force, medical treatment facilities in Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Disposable Gowns (Protective Apparel). This product line includes, but is not limited to  Disposable Procedure/Isolation Gowns,  Disposable, Latex-free Yellow Isolation Gowns, Impervious Isolation Gown w/Thumb Loop, Universal Size,  & Sterile, Poly-Reinforced, X-Large, X-Long Surgical Gown w/Hand Towel.

   The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. A single selection is intended in this project; however, the Heartland Region acknowledges the possibility of a multiple selection if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the region.   

   The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, and Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky.
 
   This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is June 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.   
Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Gowns, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $147,590.57. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project include: GOWN ISOLATION/PROCEDURE XL DISPO 1099 Cases/ $53,485.57; MEDC GOWN ISO BLUE POLY W/DISPENSER 790 Cases/ $29,715.33; ISO GOWN,SMS,LATEX FREE,YELL 310 Cases/ $28,258.60; ISO GOWN,XL,LATEX FREE,YELL
241 Cases/ $25,340.84; GOWN ECLPSE ST, SURG, W/HAND TOWEL, X-LGE/180 CASES/$15,482.24; GOWN,UNIV.,BLUE W/THUMBHOO 67 Cases/ $4,536.31; GOWN ISOLATION/PROCEDURE MED DISPO 42 Cases/ $4,383.20; GOWN ISOLATION/PROCEDURE XL DISPO 450 EA/ $774.00; P2 GOWN, UNIVERSAL SIZE, 5 DIS 7 Cases/ $469.67; IMPERVIOUS COMFORT GOWN-UNIV, 3 Cases/ $348.09; ISO GOWN W/THUMB LOOP,POLYET 5 Cases/ $278.96.

At the request of the Heartland Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075. Submissions must be received by 5:00 P.M. EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice. Failure of the vendor to meet the submittal deadline will result in exclusion.

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Failure of the vendor to meet the submittal deadline will result in exclusion. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer

D. Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTF?s in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.
Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their ?intent to participate? to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. 
Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB  by the Clinical Product Team, to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.


Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:
1.Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Disposable Gowns product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
2.Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current prime vendor Owens and Minor  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)
3.Vendors must identify the brand(s) that your company manufacture and/or distribute your product.
4.Vendors must identify if your products are manufactured under FDA (TIR) standards. Please identify any other standards
5.Vendors must identify if your products meet the AORN standards for use and selection of barrier materials.
6.Vendors must identify what types and sizes of Disposable Gowns your company provides.
7.Vendors must identify what materials your gowns come in and if they are free of latex and toxic materials.
8.Vendors gowns must barrier protection against particulate matter and fluids. Identify if this barrier protection is dependent on the number of layers the fabric has.  List the levels of protection.
9.Vendors gowns impervious regions must be labeled or indicated in some way on the item.  Identify what is the method of labeling or indication.
10.Vendors must identify if your company manufactures a full line of Disposable Gowns to include but not limited to the high usage gowns listed above
11.Vendors must identify how your company?s gown fabric construction assists in maintaining the wearer?s normal body temperature 
12.Vendors must identify if there are any precautions that should be taken to ensure that your company?s gowns perform as intended
13.Vendors must list the ASTM International test method used (and the score) for assessing your Disposable Surgical Gowns propensity to lint (i.e., flexing in air, Helmke drum test etc).
14.Vendors must list the ASTM International test method used to determine breaking strength for your Disposable Gowns (grab or strip tensile strength, burst strength, etc.) and provide the test result score for your product.
15.Vendors must list the ASTM International tear strength test method (and score) used for your  Disposable Gowns.
16.Vendors must provide information about how your company?s fabrics used Disposable Gowns  perform in a surgical fire, i.e., Meets Consumer Product Safety Commission Standard for  Flammability of Clothing Textiles (CPSC 16 CFR 1610).
17.Vendors must list how are your company?s Disposable Surgical Gowns constructed, i.e., spun-lace, spunbond, wet laid etc?
18.Vendors must list what the recommended disposal guidelines are for your Disposable Gowns  (If products are incinerated for disposal, what are the potential byproducts?)
19.Vendors must identify what types of educational tools or materials you have for this product line.
20.Vendors must identify what kind of staff training their company provides 
21.Vendors must identify if company has history of backorders and /or recalls in the past five (5) years for the product line. Explaining the a) dates and duration, b) cause, c) resolution. Vendors should provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations, and any relief of resolution which may have been provided, since there will be  no further opportunity to explain these scenarios and their effects.

1.Phase II ? Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team (CPT) formed by the TPRB will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTF?s and will be allowed 3 weeks (21 calendar days) from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM  EST, on the (21st) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and anticipated delivery date. The samples to be provided are as follows:

Polyethylene-coated, Polypropylene Disposable Gowns X-Large-3 dozen to each facility
Latex-free, Fluid Resistant, Medium Weight, Disposable, Yellow, Isolation Gowns Regular Size-3 dozen each facility.
Latex-free, Fluid Resistant, Medium Weight, Disposable, Yellow, Isolation Gowns X-Large-3 dozen each facility
Impervious, Blue, W/Thumbloop, Disposable, Universal Size-5 dozen to each facility
Sterile-Poly-Reinforced, Disposable Surgical Gown W/Hand Towel, X-Large, X-Long-2 dozen to each facility.
  
Specific MTF?s will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like scale, with a one to five rating. 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or 3.75 depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.75.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.  

To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting. 
The following equally weighted Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:

Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.75
1.It is easy to determine the level of barrier protection that the product provides (different levels of protection are needed for different cases)
2.The gown fits the wearer well (size, length, and cuff fit) (closes in the back ,is long enough to cover below knees, cuffs are long enough to cover hands for closed gloving)
3.Gown fabric has limited memory and is flexible enough to conform loosely to wearer?s body  (limited memory so gown will not hold folds and conforms loosely so wearer?s body can ?breathe?)
4.The gown has no odor products with any odor are less likely to be accepted by staff because of the length of time a gown is worn)
5.Gown fasteners and ties are constructed well (fasteners and ties should stay fastened during any procedures that the user performs)
6.Gown fabric is lint-free during use (lint can contaminate surgical site and increases the chance for infection)
7.Product does not tear and/or perforate easily during use (tears increase the chance of contaminating the sterile field)

Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.75 threshold (depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 2 weeks (14 calendar days) to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  


Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.
The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.

<DESC>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy, Colorado, is interested in establishing a maximum of four Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) to provide Asbestos Abatement.  The period of performance for these agreements will be on or about 01 Apr 08 through 31 Mar 13.  This requirement is set aside for small business.  These agreements must provide for the following requirements:  

The contractor shall furnish the personnel, services, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, facilities supervision, and other requirements necessary for, or incidental to, the performance of work set forth herein.  The location and type of ACM will be identified by the Academy Environmental Division.  This may include asbestos in soils.  The contractor shall implement controls and protocols to minimize occupational exposure to asbestos in accordance with AFI 32-1052, Facility Asbestos Management, and other applicable laws and regulations.  Other applicable regulations include but are not limited to:  Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), Air Quality Management Regulation 8 and Section 5.5 of 6 CCR 1007-2, revised April 2007 (Draft).  Types of ACM expected to be encountered:  Thermal System Insulation (TSI), Surfacing Materials (walls, ceilings, plaster & fireproofing insulation), Mastic, and Miscellaneous (floor tile, ceiling tile, roofing felt, concrete pipe, etc.)  

Payment by the Government will be made directly to the contractor upon satisfactory completion of the work.  Payment will be made via Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) or Government Purchase Card (GPC).

We are seeking a maximum of four qualified companies with which to establish the BOAs.  Contractors specializing in NAICS 562910 are being sought.  The cost magnitude for the period of performance is set at between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.
These agreements will fall under the laws and requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act.  These agreements will require a quick turn-around time and therefore companies with representation in the local area are desired.  Receiving an agreement will be based upon the company?s ability to meet the criteria in the previous paragraph.  If four or less qualified companies indicate an interest in an agreement, the Government may reserve the right to issue an agreement to all four companies.  In the event four or more responses are received, the Government may request and evaluate past performance references.  The Government reserves the right to issue up to four BOAs to the companies with the highest, relevant past performance rating.  Should an evaluation of past performance result in more than four companies remaining equally eligible, issuance of BOAs shall be made by the drawing of lots limited to those equally-eligible companies using procedures found in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 14.408-6.  

Once BOAs are established, each individual requirement for asbestos abatement will be competed among the BOA contractors and an order issued to the contractor offering the lowest, reasonable, realistic, and technically acceptable price on that particular order.  Each order will be competed in the same manner.  There is no guarantee that a contractor will receive any orders against their BOA.  

Companies interested in receiving a BOA must provide evidence of their qualifications for meeting the requirements as specified above.  In addition, any companies located outside of the Colorado Springs/Denver area must also address how you will meet the requirement to provide a local representative.  Written responses will not be returned.  If your firm is capable and qualified to provide the services, respond in writing to the point of contact indicated within this announcement no later than 17 Mar 08.  All interested business concerns shall indicate their interest in a potential BOA by providing the company name, mailing address, telephone number, cage code, DUNS number, and electronic mail address to the point of contact.  Interested business concerns shall also submit appropriate written information and/or data supporting their capability to perform the required services.  For the purpose of a potential BOA, the North American Industrial Classification Code is 562910, Remediation Services, and the applicable size standard is $13M.  Orders written against a BOA will be firm-fixed price.  The primary point of contact is Michella Hill, at (719) 333-3927 or email at Michella.Hill@usafa.af.mil or Kim Wood, at (719) 333-3200 or email at Kimberlymae.Wood@usafa.af.mil. 

5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a)  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.  The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.   

(b)  Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c)  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsman:

Lori Staples
8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 200
USAFA, CO  80840
Telephone number (719) 333-3907
FAX (719) 333-4747
Email:  lori.staples@usafa.af.mil
Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force Ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.  (d)  The Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  (e)  Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>This is a re-print of the previous Sources Sought Notice, which was published in Fedbizopts on January 23, 2008 through February 8, 2008 under the Classification Code: V-Transportation, travel, & relocation services and NAICS Code: 484210-Used Household and Office Goods Moving.   If you have already responded to our previous RFI, no need to re-submit your responses. 

The United States Department of the Navy (DoN) employs the competitive sourcing process as prescribed by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities (effective May 29, 2003) as a workforce shaping tool to acquire commercial functions at the maximum value, align military functions to war-fighting capabilities, and achieve operational savings for the fleet.  The DoN is considering conducting a follow-on competitive sourcing competition for the services provided by the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Personal Property Support Offices (PPSO).  

Purpose

As part of the preliminary planning process, your firm is invited to participate in a survey to determine commercial interest in bidding to provide personal property support services.  This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort designed to: 

Obtain expressions of interest from potential service providers to participate in a follow-on competition for the services provided by NAVSUP PPSOs;

Determine the technical and financial capability of potential service providers interested in bidding at the prime contractor level; and

Solicit input on specific topics from potential service providers for consideration during the preliminary planning and development of a solicitation under OMB Circular A-76.

Background

NAVSUP PPSOs provide personal property support services to ensure personal property and Household Goods are moved, stored, and handled in a proper and timely manner.  While PPSOs are responsible for ensuring personal property moves are properly scheduled and coordinated in a timely manner ? they do not provide actual transportation services for personal property.  In general, the services provided include:

Counseling Services:  Counseling eligible military and civilian personnel on shipping entitlements to ensure customers are properly briefed on personal property shipment options and all information is obtained to process shipments in a timely manner;

Outbound Shipment Processing:  Managing the outbound shipment of personal property (i.e., local, national, and international) and coordinating with carriers, carrier?s agents and contractors to moves are properly coordinated in a timely manner;

Storage Coordination:  Scheduling and directing Non-Temporary Storage (NTS) and Storage-In-Transit (SIT) to ensure customers? long term and short term storage needs are met; 

Inbound Shipment Coordination:  Coordinating inbound shipments to ensure customers are properly notified and delivery is scheduled in a timely manner; and

Quality Assurance:  Inspecting facilities and personal property shipments to support the performance evaluation of carriers, carrier?s agents and contractors in terms of compliance with their respective contracts and all applicable regulations and directives.

PPSOs are located in Pearl Harbor, HI; Bremerton, WA; San Diego, CA; Norfolk, VA and Jacksonville, FL. With the exception of Pearl Harbor, each location has several field offices that report to the primary office.  The current organization providing services at each location is summarized in the table below, with the FTE count for the PPSOs.  The FTE numbers listed below are the FTE numbers used for the Courtesy Congressional Announcement for this effort.  These numbers should be used as the baseline and may change as the process proceeds due to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), Joint Basing, transfer of function, workload variations, etc.

<SUBJECT>D -- Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source - Internet Services
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, ?Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.?
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires the purchase of Process Model Software.  The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Bright House Networks, LLC of 525 Grand Regency Blvd Brandon, FL 33510.  Interested parties may e-mail joseph.sherwood@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-6967, Attn: Joseph Sherwood, not later than Monday, 06 March, 2008, 12:00 p.m. EST.
Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:
 The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

Bright House is the only provider for MacDill AFB of a high speed internet service that can meet the government?s minimum bandwidth requirements.  The only other internet service provider for our area that could reasonably meet the government?s minimum requirement is Verizon.  Verizon does not currently provide their Fiber Optics Service (FiOS) ? services to MacDill AFB due to the lack of a fiber optic infrastructure that is usable by Verizon.  Bright House is the only vendor who can meet the government?s minimum requirements using the current infrastructure on site.  Using any other service provider would not meet the government?s minimum requirements and would involve excess costs and loss of man-hours due to the modifications that must be made to the infrastructure to utilize another vendor other than Bright House.  Procuring the internet/cable service with Bright House alleviates any need for additional infrastructure changes in a system that is already in place.  Bright House is the only reasonable option for the requested internet/cable service. 

The government?s minimum requirements are stated below:

15Mbps Download x 2Mbps Upload Internet Access 
25 Email accounts 
User-level Security 
1GB Remote Storage 
One Static IP

<SUBJECT>--Biometric Collection, Analysis, Fusion and Transmission Technology Demonstrations
<DESC>Military applications of biometric exploitation to date have largely focused on the use of fingerprints to identify personnel for entry into controlled areas.  Biometrics has an expanded role in military operations such as combat identification (frie nd, foe, or neutral); offensive operations (intelligence support to targeting); force protection (base access); detention operations; civil-military operations (track target members of a population); and personnel recovery and identification.  In addition,  biometrics can be utilized to improve business functions such as physical and logical access controls and privilege management applications like health care benefits, finance, and time reporting.  <BR><BR>U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is currently s eeking proposals through its Broad Agency Announcement W911NF-07-R-0001, Topic 2.63, added via Amendment 1, found at http://www.arl.army.mil/www/DownloadedInternetPages/CurrentPages/DoingBusinesswithARL/research/07_r_0001_amendment1.pdf , to develop and tr ansition new methodologies, tools, technologies and techniques that advance the state-of-the-art across the spectrum of the biometrics infrastructure to provide users with new and enhanced capabilities.  ARL solicits proposals focusing on the development a nd demonstration of functional models and the assessment of biometric functionality across any of the Focus Areas described below.  Demonstrations and assessments will be performed in coordination with the Department of Defense (DoD) Biometrics Task Force.   Results should include technical performance measurements and analysis from actual testbeds and laboratory environments.<BR><BR>Research Concentration Areas:  In order to address these challenges, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), on behalf of the  DoD Biometrics Task Force, is soliciting proposals in the following areas.  These are suggestive of topic areas that will enable future DoD systems to move toward full spectrum, biometric capabilities.  They are not in priority order and are meant to stim ulate ideas for perspective proposals.  Other novel and creative solutions are strongly encouraged. <BR><BR>a. Ability to sense and collect biometric<BR>b. Ability to enhance biometric data <BR>c. Application and processing algorithms<BR>d. Biometrics and all sources data fusion<BR>e. Biometrics database and communications architectures<BR><BR>Proposals must show, and will be expected to deliver, a functional model package that will include usable hardware/software methodologies, models archetypes, and/or t ools that can be tested and incorporated into DoD R&D programs.  An open framework environment will be provided by ARL where tools and products may be deployed and allowed to interact in real-time, interactive, evolutionary and interdependent means, allowi ng rigorous testing of new technologies, methodologies and theories in support of the DoD Biometrics Task Force.<BR><BR>While Topic 2.63 will remain open throughout the period covered by BAA W911NF-07-R-0001, funding is currently available under this topic  for up to ten procurement contract awards.  The funding level for these awards is not anticipated to exceed $750,000/year per award.  To be considered for this years funding, white papers in accordance with PART III  SECTIONS 3-4 of the ARL BAA must be received by 21 March 2008.  Each white paper must be submitted with a single PowerPoint chart, in landscape mode, divided into four equal quadrants.  The upper left quadrant shall contain a graphic representing the approach or product described in the whit e paper.  The lower left quadrant shall contain a brief description of the approach and the expected product described in the white paper.

The 14 January 2008 Amendment  added the following information to the VSD/VDD Demonstration: For the  purposes of the VSD/VDD Demonstration, a Safety of Flight Certificate is  defined as a signed statement from the company based on the data presented  in the safety of flight package and when operated to the defined  limitations their drogue is safe for flight. VSD/VDD DEMONSTRATION Potential offerors have the option of participating in a demonstration of  their existing Variable Speed Drogue/Variable Drag Drogue (VSD/VDD)  candidate.  A potential offeror?s participation is strictly voluntary and  a decision not to participate will not adversely affect the government?s  future evaluation of any proposal. The demonstration will be used by the  government to assist in risk assessment. A potential offeror that decides  not to participate in the flight demonstration may still participate in  the resulting acquisition. All flight demonstrations will be performed on  a legacy MC-130E/P tanker with Sargent Fletcher Incorporated (SFI) 48-000-  2/4 refueling pods. Potential offerors who are contemplating participation  in the flight demonstration are asked to provide information as presented  below.  This information is necessary to make necessary arrangements at  the Government flight test facility.  Flight demonstration is expected to  take place during the week of 25 February 2008.

A team from the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) 413 Flight  Test Squadron (FLTS) stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida, will conduct  the flight testing.  The 413 FLTS will conduct the flight testing at the  Eglin Air Force Base/Hurlburt Field local area testing range. The offeror does not need to be present at the flight demo to have their  candidate drogue flown.  The offeror can elect to send the drogue and the  appropriate technical data to the locations provided.  If the offeror  elects to attend the flight demo, he/she will be provided a post-flight  test briefing of the results.  Following the fight test, a video and brief  summary of the flight test results will be provided to the offeror.

1.  BACKGROUND
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) seeks interested parties to propose innovative manufacturing technology and industrial base projects under the Industrial Base Innovation Fund Program (IBIF).  The IBIF purpose, as stated in Congressional Report 110-434 (http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_reports&docid=f:hr434.110.pdf), page 346 is ?to ensure that investments are made to address shortfalls in manufacturing processes and technologies in support of the Department?s long-term and short-term needs.?
Fielding and sustaining superior weapons technology is a cornerstone of United States military strategy. The DOD?s ability to obtain superior, affordable weapons in a timely manner relies on a strong domestic industrial base and access to reliable foreign manufacturing sources. The IBIF is a program directed toward strengthening domestic manufacturing capability and eliminating dependence on unreliable foreign sources. The Defense Logistics Agency is acting on behalf of the Department of Defense in executing the IBIF. Accordingly, proposers are encouraged to submit proposals that support DOD weapon systems programs in the Systems Acquisition and Systems sustainment phases (post Milestone B) of their lifecycle. (See DODI 5000.2 https://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document&doc=2.)

The scope of the IBIF program includes all of the manufacturing technologies supporting the Aviation, Maritime, and Land Supply Chains. The goal of the IBIF program is to develop and implement significant manufacturing technology improvements into these supply chains. Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $12 million during Fiscal Year 2008 is planned to fund IBIF projects under this BAA. The expected cost range for proposals submitted under this BAA is up to $2,000,000 with a period of performance of up to 24 months.  The desirable outcome of a completed project is an advanced manufacturing capability that is implemented in the industrial base and supporting one or more current or future weapon systems. For selectable projects, DLA may consider using existing contracts, if appropriate.   Proposers may recommend such a contracting arrangement but should confirm with the contracting Officer of the existing contract that all existing contract scope, terms, conditions and ceiling requirements are met before proposing such an arrangement.  The government is anticipating the award of cost-plus-fixed, cost sharing or cost contracts.

2. GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Proposers must submit an original and eight (8) copies of full proposals and an electronic copy on a CD-ROM referring to BAA 0003-08 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on or before 18 April 2008 to the Point of Contact listed above in order to be considered.  No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same shall be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DLA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.  Large Business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.  For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard is 500 employees Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 3462.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred.  Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be disregarded.  

3. DOD MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY (MANTECH) PROGRAM INFORMATION

The vision for the MANTECH Program is to enable a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters' needs throughout the defense system life-cycle. The MANTECH Program focuses on the needs of weapon system programs for affordable, low-risk development and production. It provides the crucial link between technology invention and development, and industrial applications. The MANTECH Program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and DoD facilities, e.g., depots and shipyards. The Program addresses production issues from system development through transition to production and sustainment. Investments are driven by defense-essential needs for: the ability to support 6-sigma (low variability) manufacture, and; maturation of process capabilities to acceptable, quantified risk levels; unique production capability; low-cost, high-quality manufacture; efficient factory operations and supplier interaction; decoupling of unit cost from production volume; efficient maintenance/repair processes; and rapid, low-cost spares acquisition. Projects undertaken are beyond the normal risk or interest of industry to pursue in a timely manner. The Program focuses on manufacturing-related needs that exist across industry sectors and throughout the weapon system life-cycle. The primary benefit to the industrial base comes from the emphasis on transfer of the enhanced technologies from the initial demonstration application to the rest of industry. Investments that would benefit a single weapon system are the responsibility of system program managers and are not candidates for MANTECH funding.

The IBIF program is focusing on the Production and Sustainment phases of the Development life cycle. In the production phase, the emphasis is on rapid, low-cost, high-quality manufacturing; efficient factory operations and supplier interactions; and the decoupling of unit cost from production volume. In the support and sustainment phase, the concentration is on efficient repair processes; rapid, low-cost spares and replacement parts acquisition; and efficient maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operations. For a complete description of the MANTECH Program see https://www.dodmantech.com.

4. TECHNICAL  AREAS OF INTEREST

The areas of interest align with the DOD supply chains: Aviation, Land and Maritime and the MANTECH technology disciplines: Metals, Composites and Electronics.  (At lower tiers of the industrial base, it is understood that manufacturing technologies may cut across these Supply Chains or technologies, however, each offeror should clearly have a identified ?primary target? for implementing the proposed technology.  Proposals without a clearly identified target will not be considered for award.)  All manufacturing processes and systems are eligible for consideration, including but not limited to, new/alternative materials; faster, higher quality unit processes; reduction in process variation through advanced process control systems; tighter coupling of the supply chain through advanced information technology; part count reduction; innovative applications of Lean/6-Sigma; establishing a reliable domestic capability to alleviate dependence on an unreliable foreign source; and implementing dual use (equally capable for civil and military applications) manufacturing capability to be available to DOD during time when a surge in production is needed; etc. Although DLA sees merit in these areas, offerors are free to innovate and are not limited to proposing only these areas. Equal consideration will be given to all approaches that enable improved weapon systems manufacturing, significant reduction of lead-times, repair cycle times, reduction of inventory levels, improved quality and lower costs.
 

5. EVALUATION CRITERIA 

To be eligible for award of a contract, all prospective offerors must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, adequacy of accounting systems under a cost type contract, ability to comply with performance schedules, and a prior record of past performance, integrity, organization structure, experience, operational controls, technical skills, facilities and equipment.

1.0	BACKGROUND
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are operated differently from those in general aviation; Coast Guard missions require frequent operation within salt-laden environments, and conditions, which accelerate the corrosive attack on the airframe structures and components of the HU-25 aircraft.  Inspection of these aircraft in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturer??s (OEM) periodic requirements under the U.S. Coast Guard's specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS), historically reveals corrosion damage and operational wear and tear associated with aging aircraft, which is often outside the scope of OEM published repair limits and specifications.  During these inspections Horizontal Stabilizers S/N 411 and 404 were found unserviceable.  These stabilizers were evaluated and recommended for repair by Dassault Falcon (DFJ) Structural Engineers on 11 April 2007.  
This statement of work describes the inspection, damage evaluation, repair plan proposal and services necessary to return horizontal stabilizers S/Ns 411 & 404, their structures, and components as used on the U.S. Coast Guard HU-25 aircraft in an airworthy condition per DFJ Report Number DFJ-823-6147 and Power Point Inspection of Horizontal Stabilizers.  The horizontal stabilizers shall be painted to match the Coast Guard??s current colors and paint scheme in accordance with (IAW) ARSC Paint Drawing 925-139, and be delivered in a ready for installation condition.  All work shall be performed IAW Dassault Falcon Jet drawings specifications.  
This Statement of Work addresses DFJ??s findings and recommendations for returning each stabilizer to an airworthy condition.  However, it is recognized that during the repair process circumstances outside of the proposed scope of work may arise which could not be anticipated.  For such instances, direct communication with the Coast Guard??s Aircraft Repair and supply Center (ARSC), HU-25 Engineering Cell will be required.  These communications shall be for the purpose of clarification only and shall not be construed by the contractor as authorization for an increase in the scope of work being performed.  In the event the discussions result in need for a change, the contractor shall not perform additional work until so authorized by written modification which has been signed by an authorized Coast Guard contracting officer.  Work performed without written modification may result in unpaid performance on the part of the contractor. The ARSC HU25 Engineering Officer may be reached at (252-335-6887), or you may contact the ARSC HU25 Maintenance Officer at (252-335-6310) for any relevant questions or comments.

  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that this Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

The Operations Division consists of three teams: the Operations Support Team (OST), the Overseas Administration Team (OAT), and the Field Support Team (FST).  The OST provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue (SAR), Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, Consequence Management, overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and other sectors necessary to assure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  The OAT provides administrative services to OFDA's field offices.  The OAT also manages the Support Relief Group (SRG) program, which provides rapid, surge capacity staffing.

The FST coordinates surge capacity staffing mechanisms, manages an inter-agency agreement with the U.S. Forest Service for surge capacity staffing and OFDA response system design, maintains and trains on disaster response systems, such as the DART and RMT, coordinates with other agencies in the USG and with some elements of the United Nations (UN), and coordinates the Public Donations Information and Outreach project.  The Disaster Resources Unit (DRU), within the FST, was created to assist with the transition of OFDA to rapid-response activities during a disaster.  In addition, the DRU manages OFDA's dissemination of public donations information, OFDA's role in the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination and International Search and Rescue systems, and staff security.

OBJECTIVE

To recruit a Field Coordinator, who will coordinate the transition within OFDA to rapid-response activities during a disaster, especially related to deployment of field teams; and who will effectively coordinate OFDA's efforts with other U.S. Government agencies, in order to develop and maintain a program of disaster preparedness, mitigation and prevention activities.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Field Coordinator will supervise the following activities.  He/she will be assisted with this portfolio by the DRU's Disaster Resources Officer and occasional additional part-time staff.

* Coordination of OFDA contribution to UNDAC equipment cache.

Rapid Response Facilitation

* Initial administrative and programmatic tasks related to an OFDA team deployment, until an appropriate backstopping structure is in place;
* Recommendation and implementation of policies, procedures, and systems designed to enable and expedite such transitions;
* Investigation and utilization of alternative sources of DART and RMT staffing.

Inter-Agency Coordination
Liaison between OFDA and other USG agencies involved with international disaster response for departments and agencies not already served by another OFDA unit, such as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):
* Consultation with other USG agencies on behalf of OFDA to share information on relief activities and capabilities, and to contribute to the establishment of coordinated agency priorities with respect to overseas disaster response;
* Identification of relevant disaster response staff from other USG agencies as needed to supplement OFDA capacity;

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Field Coordinator will take direction from and will report to the FST Leader or his/her designee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

OTI's Sudan program is an integral part of the U.S. Government's effort to?strengthen Sudanese confidence and capacity to address the causes and consequences of political conflict, violence, and instability.?The OTI program is being implemented within the framework of both the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and more recently, the 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) and the Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (ESPA). OTI currently has five implementing partners in Sudan:  Development Alternatives Inc. (DAI), PACT, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and Internews Network. From 2003 to 2006, OTI programmed more than $65 million, including the development and implementation of a small grants program, with the following objectives: 1) to support emerging civil authorities at the state and local levels; 2) to promote engagement of civil society in support of peace processes and dialogue with civil authorities; 3) to increase availability of high-quality and independent information on transition issues; and 4) to protect vulnerable populations in Darfur. 

OBJECTIVE

The objective of hiring for this position is to support the OTI Country Representative - Sudan.

S/he should be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, USG agencies, and clerics or other religious leaders.

The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success.

* Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;

* Assist in the monitoring and evaluation of OTI-sponsored activities;

* Travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop Political Transition Grants;

* Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemental with additional information included in this notice. 
This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.     Solicitation Number NB20020-8-03454gr is issued as a 
request for quotation. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541199.     The NIST Technology Services Laboratory has a requirement for preparation, submission and prosecution of a Non-Provisional Patent Applications and an Accelerated Patent Application for the following 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Invention. Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide services in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW), Preparation, Submission and Prosecution of a Non-Provisional Patent Application for the following National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Invention:

FAR ULTRAVOILET DOSIMETER FOR SLOW NEUTRON DETECTION

I. Invention Abstract - The invention consists of a method for detecting slow neutrons by monitoring Lyman alpha radiation produced by the n(3He,t)p nuclear reaction induced by neutrons incident on a gas cell containing 3He or a mixture of 3He and 4He. 
Lyman alpha radiation, at a wavelength of 122 nanometers (nm) in the far-ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, is produced by the 2p 1s transition in atomic hydrogen. We have discovered that Lyman alpha radiation is produced with high efficiency when a 3He cell is irradiated with neutrons. Several mechanisms contribute to Lyman alpha production in this system: (1) direct excitation of the 2p states of hydrogen and tritium in the course of the nuclear reaction; (2) electron capture to the 2p states of hydrogen and tritium, as a result of electron transfer collisions with He atoms of the triton and proton produced in the nuclear reaction; (3) excitation by collision with He atoms of hydrogen and tritium atoms produced in the nuclear reaction; (4) radiative recombination of electrons produced in the nuclear reaction and along subsequent ionization tracks, with protons and tritons produced in the nuclear reaction, and with He2+ ions produced along the ionization track. 
When the gas cell contains only helium atoms, Lyman alpha radiation is spectrally isolated and the gas medium is transparent to it. It can be detected with high efficiency using a photomultiplier, or alternatively it can be converted to visible radiation by absorption in a sodium salicylate layer, with the visible radiation channeled to a photodetector. Because of the simplicity of the gas system, and the fact that the rates of many of the processes (1)-(4) have been (or could be) measured independently. This invention has the potential for service as a calculable absolute detector, (i.e. one whose basic mechanisms are understood in detail from first-principles atomic collision physics). It might also be used as a compact personal detector for civilian first responder and military personnel, due to its efficiency and ability to operate at low voltages. 

II. Background
	
In carrying out its responsibilities to promote technology transfer under the Stevenson-Wydler Act of 1980(as amended by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA) of 1986) the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through its Office of Technology Partnerships (OTP) often seeks patent protection for inventions.  These inventions are developed at NIST laboratories during the course of scientific and technical activities carried on in support of the NIST mission. The decision to file a non-provisional patent application for a specific invention is made when NIST determines that a patent for the invention will significantly enhance the technology transfer/commercialization attractiveness of the invention to the private, for-profit sector.

III. Scope of Work
	
The work to be delivered under this SOW by the contractor shall include all necessary supporting research, preparation, submission and prosecution of a non-provisional U.S. patent application for the above referenced NIST invention.

IV. Task 
Task 1 - Conduct all supporting research that, in the professional judgment of the Contractor, is necessary to prepare a non-provisional U. S. patent application. This shall include but not be limited to the following:
a. Review of all technical material submitted by the NIST inventor concerning the invention with the inventor(s).
b. Render an opinion concerning the patentability of the invention.

Task 2 - Prepare the patent application and all necessary supporting documentation in preparation for filing at the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  This will be accomplished with final approval on patent application content rendered by the first NIST inventor as named on the application.

Task 3 - File non-provisional patent application with the USPTO. This shall include but not be limited to the following:
a. Contractor shall file the patent application with all pertinent ink drawings and diagrams with transmittal papers with the US PTO along with an executed Declaration and Power of Attorney, and shall report the completion of this action to the NIST Technical Information Contact (TIC).
b. Contractor shall request an immediate Publication by the USPTO after the effective date of application submission patent award.
c. Contractor shall request the Information Disclosure Statement when the application is filed.
d. Contractor shall send to the NIST TIC an electronic copy of the invention?s non-provisional patent application as filed with the US PTO immediately after the application?s filing.

Task 4 - Election and preparation of Response to Restriction Requirements
a. Contractor shall provide an Analysis Letter to accompany the Response to First Office Action to include receipt, review, reporting, preparation and filing of response and reporting.
b. Contractor shall provide an Analysis Letter to accompany the Response to Second Office Action and all subsequent office actions to include Final Office Action, to include receipt, review, reporting, preparation and filing of response and reporting.

Task 5 - Electronic Copy of Claims 
a. Contractor shall provide an Electronic Copy of Claims as added, deleted and/or modified in Response to Office Actions after Response is filed with the US PTO.
b. Contractor shall provide the filing of Drawings Amended according to the Allowed Claims. 
c. Contractor shall provide the Response to Notice of Filing Missing Parts of Application.
d. Contractor shall receipt, review and provide to the NIST TIC Reporting of Notice of Allowability.
e. Contractor shall review the file wrapper for any outstanding items and resolve any outstanding issues with the USPTO.
f.  Contractor shall conduct a US PTO Examiners interview.  The interviews can be conducted in person or by telephone.

V. Deliverables
The highly variable nature of the patent process and the large, diverse number of necessary interim work products often required to support the preparation, submission and prosecution of a patent application, make it difficult to specify the exact number, type and content or these work products or to prepare a schedule for their production and delivery.

NIST understands that decisions to prepare these interim products are within the realm of a patent attorney?s professional practice and dictated by what the attorney believes to be the ?best professional practice? in the client?s interest. No time schedule or list of work products can possibly anticipate all of the contingencies that can arise during the patent prosecution that require such products. Nevertheless, the following deliverable products have been identified for production and delivery to the intended recipients during this contract:

V.1-Non-Provisional Patent Application suitable for timely submission to the USPTO with all required supporting forms, declarations and other documentation.
V.2-All submissions, e.g., amendments to the application, prepared by the Contractor in response to first, second and subsequent office actions taken during the patent prosecution by the USPTO.
V.3-All supporting drawings and diagrams intended for filing with the Non-Provisional Patent Application or in response to subsequent office actions.
V.4 Appellate documents files after Final Office Action.
V.5 The Contractor?s case file for the entire patent prosecution, to include all attorney correspondence with the US PTO.

VI. Period of Performance
The period of performance for this contract is five (5) years from the effective date of award, but may be extended as necessary by NIST for an additional five (5) one-year options for prosecuting this non-provisional patent.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her MEDEVAC insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the MEDEVAC insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the MEDEVAC insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that MEDEVAC insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her MEDEVAC provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).
