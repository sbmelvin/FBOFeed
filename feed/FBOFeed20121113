<DESC>The Samuel S. Stratton VA Medical Center (hereafter "The VA" or "VA"), located at 113 Holland Avenue, Albany NY, 12208, has a requirement for a New Emergency Department.  The work includes but is not limited to the following:
The project includes design and construction period services for the creation of an approximately 28,200 square foot addition to the Main Hospital building at the Stratton VA Medical Center.  This addition primarily is for an approximately 10,400 square foot new Emergency Department at grade on the end of the hospital's B-wing. The remaining area is intended as a new connector to the main hospital's building core, shell space for later offices and a shelled basement underneath all grade-level additions. 
The new addition will be designed structurally to accommodate future vertical expansion. Site work is included in this project to provide separate routing for ambulance arrivals and patient walk-ins.
An initial study of the project has already been completed under a separate contract. Preliminary space programming requirements have been detailed in that report. In addition to the basic Emergency Department rooms, a dedicated x-ray room and a pneumatic tube transport system will be included in this project.
The VA intends to release this as a competitive Invitation for Bids (IFB). The applicable NAICS code for this project is 236220, "COMMERCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION."  The estimated construction value of this project falls within the range of $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  
The VA is currently surveying the market via a Sources Sought notice to determine the bonding capacity of various socio-economic groups.  The response from the sources sought and other market research will determine the set aside category for this acquisition.  The set-aside will not be announced before the solicitation is published to FBO.  The solicitation is expected to be released during or about the week of May 14, 2012.  
Unless additional notice is given or this notice is modified, the full IFB will be posted to the Government-wide Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov).

This is a presolicitation notice synopsizing an upcoming competitive solicitation to satisfy the requirements of FAR 5.201 and 5.203.

<DESC>Market Survey/Request for Information on ARSR-4 Transmitter Cooling System (TCS)
GENERAL INFORMATION:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace and to identify qualified and capable sources.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.  Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities to meet requirements in the attached description.  The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy.  Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the Source List to be used when the solicitation for this requirement is issued, and will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) or Small Business, or open it up for full and open competition.  Any interested sources may respond to this market survey.  The information identified from this market survey may result in a restricted Screening Process when the RFP is issued.  All decisions will be made based on the information provided by vendors responding to this market survey.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for planning purposes only.
BACKGROUND
The ARSR-4 radar system is the United States' newest long range radar system and completed deployment in year 2000.  This system provides radar coverage for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The radar transmitter used in the ARSR-4 system is located in a room on the upper portion of the radar tower just below the antenna.  The method that was employed to cool the transmitter is comprised of a high pressure blower that draws unconditioned air from the outside of the structure, forces it across cooling coils in the transmitter, and then exhausts the heated air back outside the structure.  This method resulted in the accelerated deterioration and reduced life of components in the transmitter, as well as other equipment in the transmitter room.  To fix this situation, the FAA created a design that no longer re-circulates unconditioned air through the transmitter.  The primary component of this design is a special-purpose refrigerant-based cooling system.  This system draws air through the transmitter, cools the heated air, and then exhausts the air back into the room.  FAA engineers have completed the design of the cooling system, and the design package is ready for manufacture and production.
The NAICS CODE for this requirement will be 333415, Air-Conditioning and Warm Air Heating Equipment and Commercial and Industrial Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturing, with a Small Business Size Standard of 750 employees.

Responses to this market survey may also be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.
All interested vendors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information.  Therefore, any costs associated with vendor's Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.
All FAA documents are to be downloaded and printed from the FAA Contracting Opportunities Home Page found at http://faaco.faa.gov (or by access through http://fast.faa.gov).  Please note that documents downloaded from sites other than the FAA's Contracting Opportunities Homepage may not be the latest documents.  All FAA SIR amendments will also be shown on this site as "Amendment" when required.  Vendors must access this site daily to determine if additional SIR amendments have been issued.  Only vendors that respond with information packages providing the required information demonstrating that their firm meets the minimum requirements will be added to the Source List.  The minimum requirements will remain the same for the issued SIR as contained in the requested information for this market survey.
RESPONSE TO THIS MARKET SURVEY:
Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for accommodation services for 15 units of NanoLabs onboard the Nanoracks Research Platforms for payload integration and operation services and to provide one utilization time slot for the NanoRacks Refractive Microscope, one utilization time slot for the NanoRacks Reflective Microscope, and one utilization time slot for reading of a Microplate in the NanoRacks Microplate Reader. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from NanoRacks, LLC. Under a Space Act Agreement, NanoRacks, LLC, has developed biological laboratories to increase the on-orbit analysis capacity on the International Space Station (ISS).  This effort will procure the accommodations for 15 units of laboratory space in these NanoRacks-NanoLabs and the related payload integration services required for the units to be launched and serviced during the mission. The NanoLabs are NanoRacks technology and is the only company that performs the integration and operation services for the NanoLabs. Therefore, no other company is able to provide these services. This effort also includes one use of the NanoRacks Refractive Microscope and one use of the NanoRacks Reflective Microscope currently on-board the ISS.  The NanoRacks Refractive Microscope is the only refractive microscope on-board the ISS, so only NanoRacks is able to provide these services. Also, the NanoRacks Reflective Microscope is the only reflective microscope which allows research to be performed outside of a glove box. Therefore, only NanoRacks is able to provide services for research that requires to be performed under this condition. Additionally, one utilization time slot for reading of a Microplate in the NanoRacks Microplate Reader is required.	The NanoRacks Microplate Reader is the only plate reader on-board the ISS, so only NanoRacks is able to provide this analytical capability. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 28, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to use other than full and open competition to issue a
modification to BAE Systems San Diego Ship Repair (BAE) contract N00024-10-C-4407 to allow for the
execution of emergent dry-docking requirements. The anticipated contract action will provide for execution
planning and accomplishment of the Docking Phased Maintenance Availability (DPMA) for LPD 20 (USS
GREEN BAY). The specific work items to be planned and performed are described in the attachment provided
with this notice.
 
In accordance with the authority provided under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to issue the
modification to BAE without providing for full and open competition.
BAE is the incumbent prime contractor
on the current multi-ship, multi-option (MSMO) repair contract for LPD 17 class vessels homeported in San
Diego, CA, and is the only responsible source with the necessary personnel, equipment and knowledge of the
complex characteristics unique to the LPD 17 class of ships. The time required to solicit and review
additional bids for completing the emergent DPMA requirements would cause significant, unacceptable
delays, as described in 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B).
 
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered
by NAVSEA.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This solicitation number is RFQ-RT-13-00023 and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 12 Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-55, effective February 2, 2012.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 238220 - Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors, which has a size standard of $14.0 million, is applica ble.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for: 1) - the purchase, supply and installation of two high efficiency, condensing boilers, 2) - the installation of four (4) previously purchased Government furnished boilers, and 3) - the removal and disposal of existing boilers in accordance with the Statement of Work.  See the SF-18 (Attachment # 1) for a list of contract line items.  
A.  BACKGROUND - The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Western Ecology Division (WED) Plant Ecology Laboratory building in Corvallis is a one story structure with a mechanical penthouse constructed in 1984 and is served by two 750mbtu Burnham PF504.  Boiler #2 has been removed.  Rather than expending the cost of repair, EPA WED has elected for replacement with high efficiency condensing boilers to conserve energy.
EPA?s WED Corvallis laboratory building is a two story structure constructed in 1966 and is served by two 3,000mbtu Hurst boilers.  Boiler #1 needs to be re-tubed.  Rather than expending the cost for repair, EPA?s WED has elected for replacement with high efficiency condensing boilers to conserve energy.
The EPA WED?s Newport Laboratory building was constructed in the 1994.  The original HVAC heating design utilized heat pumps and was replaced in 2005 with three hydronic natural gas fired boiler units that service the 38,000 sf main building.  These units are RBI model DB1500?s each and are control automated.  The existing units reside in a small detached concrete block structure.  Because of the size of the existing horizontal units, it is not possible to remove a unit through the 48? door without first removing the center unit that blocks the door.  The current exhaust stack and piping will need to be isolated so that the remaining unit will continue to provide service.

Congress enacted the new requirements set forth in PL 112-154 for VA's payment for the care of mandatory Veterans (see attached highlights under Title I Sec 105) and ensures that SVH are adequately reimbursed for the care provided.
Under the intended basic ordering agreements, SVHs shall be required to provide nursing home care to eligible Veterans in accordance with standards specified in 38 CFR Part 51, Subpart D.

All States Nursing Home Representatives must provide the Contracting Officer (CO), who is identified as the Point of Contact in this pre-solicitation notice for this solicitation, with their single point of contact (SPOC) for the CO to issue the solicitation on the aforementioned issue date. Provide the SPOC's name, email address and telephone number prior to the solicitation issue date of December 6, 2012. For States in  which SVHs already have a direct relationship with the Department of Veteran Affairs Veterans Health Administration and are not required to provide services to veterans through their responsible State's Department of Health or other State Agency, all SVHs must contact the CO directly to provide the aforementioned information for their SPOC prior to the solicitation issue date. SVHs that provide nursing home care directly to veterans and are not required to provide services through a State Agency such as the State Department of Health, are also required to register their Home with the federal government's Systems for Award Management, also known as SAM.gov, and update their Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) within SAM prior to responding to this solicitation. Additionally, all independent SVHs which do not currently have a  Dunn and Bradstreet number prior to responding to this solicitation must obtain this number, also referred to as the DUNS number, prior to responding to this solicitation.

<CONTACT>Mark C. Rinaldi, Phone 5082336146, Email mark.c.rinaldi.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>This is a sources sought/request for information (RFI) synopsis stating that the United States Army is seeking potential vendors for a contemplated competitive solicitation for commercial generation and modification of CAD drawings and solid models. When responding, please indicate your company's small business status and if your company has experience with military design drawings.</p>
<p>Please be advised that this is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotation (RFQ). The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred in providing this information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The US Army is looking for interested vendors for generation and modification of CAD drawings and solid models for Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC). NSRDEC has a responsibility for the development and maintenance of technical data packages used to procure its multiple commodities. This requires maintenance of the engineering data, such as drawings. Drawings are one of the most important components of a technical data package. Once an item has completed development and is ready for procurement, the drawing package is placed under configuration management and any subsequent changes (corrections, ECPs etc.) need to be strictly documented and recorded. This situation results in a sporadic level of activity involving drafting and the insertion of the changes into the drawing package so that it remains up-to-date, accurate, and available for procurement and reprocurement. We need to award a contract to provide the NSRDEC and Natick Soldier Systems Center (NSSC) partner organizations, with on-going drafting support for the generation and modification of drawings and drawing packages. The following work shall be performed on or off site at the customer's discretion.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall deliver drawings and/or solid models in support of NSRDEC items. NSRDEC anticipates the following work may be needed to produce these deliverables:</p>
<p>1. Preparation of new drawings, i.e. detail drawings, interface drawings, and outline drawings, arrangement drawings or conceptual drawing. All drawings must be in compliance with MIL-T-31000 &amp; ASME Y14.100. Drawings are in support of systems such as:</p>
<p>&bull; Composite rigid wall, fabric, and inflatable airbeam structures<br />&bull; Airdrop/aerial delivery equipment<br />&bull; Individual equipment and apparel<br />&bull; Field Feeding equipment</p>
<p>2. Reverse engineer fabric components / prototypes and deliver drawings with a sufficient level of sections, details and salient characteristics to allow for reproducibility by industrial base.</p>
<p>3. Review drawings and deliver mark-ups identifying deficiencies.</p>
<p>4. Modify existing drawings to incorporate changes as necessary.</p>
<p><br />Drawings shall be in one of the following formats (as specified in individual task orders), with additional software utilized at the Government's discretion: <br />&bull; AutoCAD 2011 or higher, 2D and 3D<br />&bull; Solidworks - Solid Modeling<br />&bull; GTX Raster Cad Plus (Raster Conversion)</p>
<p><br />Responses to this RFI should be constructed as a Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat document containing a<br />description, of the vendor's ability to perform the above required support in compliance with MIL-T-31000 &amp; ASME Y14.100 for like or similar items. Please send these responses as an email attachment to Mr. Mark Rinaldi (Mark.C.Rinaldi.civ@mail.mil).</p>
<p>*Note: This notice is published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Part (FAR) Part 10, Market Research and FAR Part 15, Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposal. This notice serves as a Request for Information (RFI) in support of market research. All information received will be used for planning purposes only. This notice does not constitute an Invitation to Bid, a Request for Proposal, or a Request for Quote.

<CONTACT>Alison Landin, Email alison.m.landin.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><br />The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground-Belvoir, and the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) are seeking qualified sources for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) sponsored Remote Visualization (RVIS) rapid fielding initiative. The Army requires capabilities to support route clearance packages by transmitting ground penetrating radar (GPR) data from the Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) to follow-on vehicles to provide improved situational awareness and decrease the decision time to interpret ground penetrating radar (GPR) data on a graphical user interface (GUI). The U.S. Army is interested in sources that have potential to meet the following requirements:
<p>(1)Near real-time telemetry of the HMDS GRP data is required to allow the RVIS operator in a follow-on vehicle to view and manipulate the data on a GUI. The radio transmitting GPR data must have electromagnetic compatibility with electronic counter measures (ECM) while not degrading the performance of the HMDS.</p>
<p>(2)A GUI is required to reduce the decision time for an operator to interpret ground penetrating radar data from the HMDS and detect an IED target. The GUI is required to allow 90% of operator decisions to be made in less than 20 seconds. The GUI is required to provide a three dimension visualization of the GPR data.</p>
<p>(3)A marking capability on the HMDS is required to accurately and precisely mark the detected explosive hazards and trigger mechanisms detected by the GPR to minimize the area required to be interrogated by a digging arm on a following vehicle (digging arm is not part of this survey). This capability is required to have manual marking of the road surface with a miss distance from the mark to the actual target not to exceed + or - 0.3 meters along-track and + or - .2 meters across-track. The marking capability should be a minimum of 2.6 meters in width.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Army requires the following:</p>
<p>(1)Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) Support Services: Field Service Representatives (FSRs) and trainers are required to support the currently fielded systems in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).</p>
<p>(2)CONUS Support Activities: The fabrication of spare parts, training support, field service representatives (FSRs), and testing is required to support the currently fielded CONUS and OCONUS RVIS systems.</p>
<p>(3)Systems: RVIS systems to support CONUS or OCONUS operations.</p>
<p>Common Attributes: (1) The GUI, radio and marking capability are required to be installed on the HMDS. (2) The GUI and radio are required to be installed in the passenger compartment (multiple seating configurations) on the RG-31MK5E, Buffalo or Cougar Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) platforms.</p>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY</span>. It is neither a solicitation announcement nor a request for proposals or quotes and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Responses to this Sources Sought must be in writing. The purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is for market research to make appropriate acquisition decisions and to gain knowledge of potential qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Veteran Owned Small Businesses, 8(a), Hub-Zone and other Small Businesses interested and capable of performing the work. <br /><br />Responses to this notice shall include the following: (a) company name b) address (c) point of contact (d) phone, fax, and email (e) DUNS number (f) Cage Code (g) Tax ID Number (h) Type of small business, e.g. Services Disabled Veteran Owned small Business, Veteran-owned small business, 8(a), HUB-Zone, Women Owned Small Business, Small disadvantaged business, or Small Business HUB-Zone business and (i) must provide a capability statement that addresses the organizations qualifications and ability to perform as a contractor for training services on the GSA Schedule. Submissions should be limited to two pages. <strong>Please indicate whether your organization has an existing business license or is interested in obtaining one.&nbsp; Also please indicate your schedule and category. <br /><br /></strong>The Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has two future requirements in Tajikistan for Border Police Training and Law Enforcement Training. <br /><br />We intend to use the GSA Schedule 84: <br /><br />84 TOTAL SOLUTIONS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, SECURITY, FACILITIES MANAGEMENT, FIRE, RESCUE, CLOTHING, MARINE CRAFT AND EMERGENCY/DISASTER RESPONSE <br /><br />426 6 Law Enforcement and Security Training - Including but not limited to all types of range safety and operations training, all types of high performance and defensive/offensive driving training, all types of weapons training, force protection training, surveillance and surveillance detection training, maritime security training, all types of close quarters defense (CQD) training, special response team training, chemical/biological and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) detection training, terrorism awareness training, survival training, explosive ordnance detonation (EOD) training, and tactical training in realistic physical environments. Also includes all types of products required to support the training.<br /><br />246 52 Professional Security/Facility Management Services - including security consulting, training and facility management consulting. <br />The police training will require a local Program Management Office. Therefore it may be necessary to register as a business in the Tajikistan.
<p>Instructions to receive a Tajikistan Business License are as follows: <br />Establishing an Office</p>
<p>It is difficult to obtain reliable and detailed information about Tajik companies. U.S. companies wishing to establish a presence in Tajikistan are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe for guidance. The U.S. Embassy website is located at: http://dushanbe.usembassy.gov/. It is strongly advised that interested U.S. companies retain legal counsel to assist with the business registration process. The U.S. Embassy economic section can provide contact information for international and Tajik consulting companies that offer professional legal advice on business registration, licensing, and business operations in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>The first step in setting up an office is to establish a legal presence. Tajik law provides three options for establishing a legal presence: (i) a representative office, (ii) a branch office, and/or (iii) a legal entity established under the laws of Tajikistan.</p>
<p>A representative office may perform informational and liaison functions of the company. It can open a bank account, rent an office, and provide visa support, but it cannot engage in trade and commercial activities.</p>
<p>Branch offices maintain a close connection with the parent company. Branch offices may perform any function, including representational functions. Representative and branch offices are not separate legal entities; therefore, the parent company may be held liable.</p>
<p>The new law, "State Registration of Legal Entities and Individual Entrepreneurs," <br />signed by President Rahmon on March 26, 2010, establishes a relatively simplified state registration process for individual entrepreneurs and legal entities including foreign businesses.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy recommends that businesses solicit experienced and well-established legal counsel when registering a company.</p>
<p>Official registration of a legal entity is organized through the Tax Committee at the Government of Tajikistan. The Department of "State Registration of Legal Entities and Individual Entrepreneurs" is responsible for Single Window state registration. More information can be found on the website of the Tax Committee of the Government of Tajikistan: www.andoz.tj</p>

<CONTACT>Tayaria L Smith, Phone 7704882797, Email gqq4@cdc.gov
<DESC>Notice of Intent <br />2013-53910
<p><br />The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price contract, in accordance with FAR Part 13, using simplified acquisition procedures, to the Kongwa Trachoma Project, Plot 1 Ujenzi Area, P.O. box 124 Dodoma, Tanzania. The Kongwa Trachoma Project will deliver the following performance work statement.</p>
<p><br />Performance Work Statement</p>
<p><br />Collection and Analysis of Scabies Specimens from Kongwa District, Tanzania</p>
<p>A. Background and Need<br />Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of painful and debilitating parasitic and bacterial diseases that affect an estimated 1.4 billion of the world's poorest people, many of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. Many NTD programs are using mass drug administrations (MDA) to successfully reduce the prevalence and intensity of infection. The similarity of implementation strategies for NTDs addressed by MDA and the geographic overlap of many NTDs have led to the rapid adoption of integrated NTD programs both by countries and the donor communities.</p>
<p>As integrated NTD programs scale-up, effective and practical tools to monitor and evaluate program impact on disease prevalence and morbidity are increasingly needed. The Parasitic Disease Branch (PBD), within the Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria (DPDM) at CDC's Center for Global Health, has as its mission the prevention and control of parasitic diseases in the United States and globally and is responsible for conducting monitoring and evaluation, surveillance and investigations. In this capacity, PBD/DPDM works closely with national NTD programs in endemic countries to refine, create and validate monitoring and evaluation tools that can be implemented as part of an integrated NTD surveillance strategy. Monitoring and evaluation tools include tests such as stool concentration and urine filtration exams to detect schistosome eggs, testing by immunocromatographic card test (ICT) for filarial antigen in the blood, clinical ocular examinations for trachoma, clinical skin examinations and serologic assays.</p>
<p>The Parasitic Disease Branch has partnered with the Ministry of Health of Tanzania (MoH) and the Kongwa Trachoma Project (KTP) in an ongoing project to evaluate the performance of monitoring and evaluation tools for three NTDs: lymphatic filariasis, soil-transmitted helminths and trachoma, in eight endemic communities in Kongwa district, Tanzania, a USG focus country. Prior to MDA in these communities, urine samples, stool samples and dried blood spots are being collected from target age groups, and individuals are being clinically examined for signs of ocular trachoma and skin infections.</p>
<p>This project will provide an opportunity to collect data on ancillary public health benefits derived from the ongoing MDA with ivermectin, used to treat lymphatic filariasis. Mass drug administrations for NTDs often have ancillary health benefits that could be measured as part of an integrated NTD M&amp;E strategy, and the indirect effect of ivermectin on skin conditions such as scabies is one example of this. The scabbing associated with scabies harbors streptococcal superinfections that can lead to severe downstream effects such as rheumatic heart disease and kidney disease. Treatment with ivermectin may result in important clinical benefits, but empirical data on these public health benefits is lacking and needed to plan more effective interventions.</p>
<p>B. Purpose<br />The purpose of this non-severable contract is to allow CDC to assess the benefit of MDA with ivermectin on skin conditions such as scabies as part of an integrated NTD surveillance strategy. The vendor will collect swabs from visible scabies skin lesions and conduct laboratory analyses for bacterial superinfections on the swabs. The resulting data from these analyses will allow CDC to determine the impact of ivermectin treatment on scabies infections and to assess the value of including bacterial indicators within an integrated NTD M&amp;E strategy that could be used in Tanzania and other NTD-endemic countries.</p>
<p><br />C. Performance Work Statement : <br />The scope of work for this contract is indicated below. <br />Under this requisition, the vendor is to conduct the following:</p>
<p>1. Supplies purchases and training of personnel: the vendor will purchase all field and laboratory supplies necessary to carry out the field data collection and laboratory processing and analysis of the scabies swabs. The vendor will train field and laboratory personnel on field data collection procedures and laboratory processing and analysis techniques. Vendor will ensure all IRB approvals are in place.<br />2. Field data collection of scabies swabs: the vendor will employ trained health personnel to collect de-identified samples from scabies lesions and/or fingertips by using sterile swabs wetted with a skim milk-tryptone-glucose-glycerol broth (STGGB). Swabs will be stored in plastic bags in refrigeration until they can be transported to a laboratory for processing and analysis.<br />3. Laboratory processing and analysis of scabies swabs: the vendor will employ laboratory personnel trained in scabies swab processing and analysis methods to bacteriologically process and analyze the scabies swabs. Swabs will be cultured on 5% sheep blood agar and/or examined by PCR (Gen-Probe) for determination of streptococci and other bacterial infections. Samples will be processed and analyzed in Tanzania. De-identified data in an Excel spreadsheet will be provided to CDC for further analysis. <br />4. Reporting: the vendor will submit a final report on all field data collection and laboratory processing and analysis of scabies swabs.</p>
<p><br />D. Period of Performance/Delivery Schedule:</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be 7 months, from November 26, 2012, through June 30, 2013. Deliverables shall be as follows:</p>
<p>Collection and Analysis of Scabies Specimens from Kongwa District, Tanzania</p>
<p>Performance Requirement Summaries<br />In general, the deliverables completed by the Contractor will be evaluated in terms of how well the requirements of the contract are satisfied. The COR or COTR will inspect 100% of deliverables to ensure there is a match between actual and expected performance. If there are discrepancies, the Contract Discrepancy Report (Enclosure 1 below) will be used to communicate these performance concerns to the Contractor, and follow through to ensure performance gaps are closed. The Contracting Officer will be kept abreast of the Inspection findings and means to resolve identified performance concerns. <br />Note: Periodic performance feedback given to the Contractor by the COR or COTR conducting inspection may be of great benefit to the Contractor by providing timely and insightful feedback about any "mid-course corrections" the Contractor may need to make to achieve the contract requirements. In addition, the information obtained from such incremental surveillance activities will form the basis for the COR completing the Performance Criteria and Their Ratings form (Enclosure 2 below).</p>
<p>The actual Inspection conducted by the COR or COTR includes using Performance Requirement Summary (PRS). See attachment 1:<br />Attachment 1:<br />Task/Deliverable Performance Standard/ Indicator Acceptable Quality Level(s) Surveillance Method Incentives<br />Checklist of purchased supplies and completed training Timeliness On or before December 3, 2012<br />Letter (via email) from the vendor reflecting the successful completion of supply purchase and training Positive report regarding performance timeliness and completion of task.<br />Quality A written, general statement from the vendor describing supplies purchased and training that has been completed. <br />De-identified samples and data collected in an Excel spreadsheet and sent to CDC (field) Timeliness On or before December 15, 2012<br />Letter (via email) from the vendor reflecting the successful submission of data and specimens Positive report regarding performance timeliness and completion of task.<br />Quality Data and samples determined by the CDC COTR / project officer to be complete and of acceptable quality <br />De-identified samples and data collected in an Excel spreadsheet and sent to CDC (laboratory: first batch of samples) Timeliness On or before February 28, 2013<br />Letter (via email) from the vendor reflecting the successful submission of data and specimens Positive report regarding performance timeliness and completion of task.<br />Quality Data and samples determined by the CDC COTR / project officer to be complete and of acceptable quality <br />De-identified samples and data collected in an Excel spreadsheet and sent to CDC (laboratory: second batch of samples) Timeliness On or before April 30, 2013<br />Letter (via email) from the vendor reflecting the successful submission of data and specimens Positive report regarding performance timeliness and completion of task.<br />Quality Data and samples determined by the CDC COTR / project officer to be complete and of acceptable quality <br />Final report on all field data collection and laboratory process in and analysis:</p>

<DESC>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ORIGINALLY APPEARED ON FBO IN APRIL, 2012 AS NOTICE AMD-12-SS24. IT IS HEREBY UPDATED TO REFLECT RECENT NAICS AND SIZE STANDARD CHANGES THAT WENT INTO EFFECT IN OCTOBER, 2012. THE SIZE STANDARD FOR NAICS CODE 541330 HAS BEEN INCREASED TO $14.0M. THE PURPOSE OF THE REPOSTING OF THIS NOTICE IS TO UPDATE NIST'S MARKET RESEARCH FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.
<p><br />The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) with professional engineering services to provide and maintain an infrastructure to run the NCNR as a cost effective and safe research facility. The specific objective of this contemplated procurement is to allow the NCNR to have access to world class engineering services under one or more IDIQ contract(s). The exact nature of these services will be specified in subsequent Task Orders (see below for examples). The estimated maximum quantity of services the Government will acquire under the IDIQ contract(s) is $30M over a five-year period (consisting of a base year and four, one-year, option periods).</p>
<p>NOTE: This is NOT a request for proposal, a promise to contract or a commitment of any kind. The Government will not assume liability for costs incurred by any vendor for presentations, travel, marketing efforts or data offered for examination, therefore, the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The NCNR owns and operates a heavy water moderated nuclear test reactor. This reactor is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as the National Bureau of Standards Reactor (NBSR). The current license of the NBSR is valid until 2029. At this point in time there are no plans to decommission the reactor at that time, thus it must be assumed that the life of the reactor extends beyond 2029. The purpose of the NBSR is to provide neutrons for a state of the art neutron beam research facility in which scientists and engineers from all over the world perform research in Biology, Materials Science, Chemistry and Physics. Some of the research performed at the NCNR is fundamental in nature; other research is directly applicable to problems of immediate societal interest. Examples of recent NCNR research results can be found at the home page of the NCNR: www.ncnr.nist.gov.</p>
<p>In order to keep the reactor running safely and reliably as well as to take full advantage of advances in neutron measurement science and methodology, at any given time a large variety of engineering projects are being undertaken simultaneously at the NCNR. Projects range from large scale reactor system upgrades to the design and planning for new and/or improved neutron beam research instrumentation.<br /><br />Examples of engineering projects that may be procured under the IDIQ(s) include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1 Design and drafting of improved procedures for regularly scheduled maintenance of the NBSR.</p>
<p>2 Improvements in designs of NBSR components.</p>
<p>3 Design and/or implementation of upgrades to key reactor systems and peripheral systems.</p>
<p>4 Conversion of legacy engineering information from hand drawings into digital formats.</p>
<p>5 Designs and/or implementations of upgrades to existing scientific instrumentation.</p>
<p>6 New design and/or building of Neutron Scattering Spectrometers and Neutron Guide Systems.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing neutron velocity selectors used for the filtering of beam-line thermal neutrons.<br />&nbsp;<br />Specifically, NIST seeks information about neutron velocity selectors that can filter a rectangular neutron beam that is 6.5 cm wide and 15 cm high, and can selectively pass neutrons over a wavelength range of 3.1 Angstroms to 1.2 Angstroms (8.5 meV to 58 meV). The minimum peak beam transmission at +/-0.005 rad divergence is 80%. The neutron velocity selector will be used to pre-monochromate an incident neutron beam; pyrolytic graphite or Cu monochromators will still be employed to provide the narrow wavelength selection needed for the intended use on a triple-axis neutron scattering instrument. Available physical space is limited for this velocity selector. Therefore, additional requirements include a maximum window-to-window length in the beamline of 40 cm, maximum total width of 50 cm, and a maximum total length of 60 cm including motor, electrical connectors, etc.<br /><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a neutron velocity selector that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.<br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice. <br /><br />Companies that manufacture such selectors are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications (including specifications for neutron velocity selectors that exceed the requirements above) and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: <br /><br />1. Name of the company that manufactures the selector for which specifications are provided. <br />2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the selector, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). <br />3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such selectors. <br />4. Indication of whether each selector for which specifications are provided is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). <br />5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<DESC>NIDDK Data Repository<br />This is a Small Business Sources notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBzone small businesses; service-disabled small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged small businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />&nbsp;
<p>1.0 BACKGROUND. Storing and allowing subsequent use of biological materials and associated data collected in clinical studies is one way for the NIDDK to meet its responsibility to maximize the value of these studies. The NIDDK's Central Repositories' collection of the biosamples and associated clinical, diagnostic, genotypic, pedigree structure and/or other data is a resource that advances the development of diagnostic and treatment tools for many diseases. The NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories, which are separately supported, house biological materials collected in large clinical studies. The project described in this sources sought notice will be referred to herein as "The Data Repository," stores the data from these large studies, including data associated with the stored biosamples and acts as the Data Coordinating Center for the NIDDK Central Repositories. The Database Repository, acting as a central coordinating entity, facilitates efficient distribution of data and samples. As an archive and distributor of highly usable legacy datasets, the Repository also allows re-analysis of these data and, where relevant, of specific biosamples, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in the original funded studies.</p>
<p>2.0 PUROSE AND OBJECTIVES. The objective of this contract will be to continue the NIDDK Data Repository, in order to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:</p>
<p>i. Assist study coordinating centers and the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repository in setting up labeling systems to cross-reference samples and associated data.</p>
<p>ii. Maintain a central inventory of samples kept at the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories, and provide inventory reporting structures for individual studies. The inventory must clearly indicate additions, subtractions, and up to date totals of all sample types.</p>
<p>iii. Receive and test the validity of electronic databases from completed studies.</p>
<p>iv. Maintain and distribute those databases, including administering review of access applications.</p>
<p>v. Provide timely and informative analyses of databases in response to researcher inquiries.</p>
<p>vi. Create and maintain a website for all of the NIDDK Central Repositories.</p>
<p>vii. Carry out activities to advertise to the research community about the availability of samples and data.</p>
<p>The information systems, consulting, and database archiving tasks outlined in this sources sought notice are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment. The data from each study represent the efforts of hundreds of investigators to improve the public health through biomedical research, and the voluntary participation of hundreds or thousands of patients and family members. The data and samples represent tax payer funded work by the National Institutes of Health and it is important that these be made available to qualified researchers for the public benefit. The data cannot be replaced without great expense and effort, and, therefore, it is essential that they be protected from loss, damage or misuse. The Contractor's project director must have extensive experience in successful database management. The Contractor's staff must be highly trained to work with, maintain, and analyze numerous databases, including those in Oracle and other DBMS's. Because all these studies contain data from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical issues involved in handling subject data. Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.</p>
<p>3.0 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS. The tasks to be performed under the new requirement include, but are not limited to the following:<br /><br />(1) Receive and test the accuracy, completeness and validity of electronic databases of participant information from completed studies that include clinical, diagnostic, genotypic, pedigree structure and other data, along with supporting documentation. <br />(2) Link phenotypic data to high-density genotyping data stored in the dbGAP (database of Genotype and Phenotype) or comparable database. <br />(3) Consult with data coordinating centers (DCC's) from new and ongoing studies and with the NIDDK Genetics and Biosample Repositories to facilitate use of the NIDDK Central Repositories. <br />(4) Work in a cooperative fashion with the Project Officer, the External Advisory Committee, and the Steering Committee. <br />(5) Maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from data. <br />(6) Provide timely and accurate analyses of databases regarding the availability of samples, including the determination of the feasibility of the repository to meet the needs of a research request, such as the number of samples available that meet specific criteria.<br />(7) Maintain and distribute stored databases or selected portions of stored databases to qualified investigators granted access by the Project Officer.<br />(8) Establish and maintain general Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) programs.<br />(9) Provide security and back-up systems and a plan for disaster recovery.<br />(10) Maintain a public forum, including a web site, as a resource for users of the repository, and as a tool for public education about the repository and its goals, including a list of publications resulting from use of repository samples.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance. It is anticipated that the period of performance will be for five years beginning approximately July 2013.</p>
<p>4.0 CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT. Respondents must submit a capability statement that demonstrates the potential offeror's qualification, experience, and expertise, specifically providing evidence for the following:(a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is officially conducting market research that will be used to develop the Architect-Engineering (A-E) Acquisition Plan for Value Engineering Studies.
<p>Value Engineering (VE) is a creative, organized effort, which analyzes the requirements of a project for the purpose of achieving the essential functions at the lowest total costs (capital, staffing, energy, maintenance) over the life of the project. For SAS, this primarily consists of utilizing the six-step value engineering job plan consisting of the Information Phase, the FAST Analysis Phase, the Creative Phase, the Evaluation Phase, the Development Phase and the Presentation Phase. These concepts will be applied to facilities in any phase of the design process.</p>
<p>Work will predominately consist of providing value engineering services by following the Value Engineering methodology expressed by the Society American Value Engineers (SAVE) using Value Engineering Study Reports. SAS is required to VE any project greater than $2000K and any O&amp;M project greater than $1000K in accordance with ER 11-1-321.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

INTRODUCTION: 

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, "Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes" This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is conducting a market survey and is seeking potential sources for the Decontamination and Demolition (D&D) of the AJ Blotcky Reactor Facility (AJBRF) located in the VA Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska (VAMC Omaha), part of the Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System.  The facility operates under U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) operating license R-57.

Including and in addition to the decommissioning tasks described in the Draft DP, decommissioning tasks include the following:

"	Project planning and document preparation (consistent with Draft DP)
o	Engineering and Field Implementation Plan 
o	Waste Management Plan
o	Health and Safety Plan (HASP)
o	Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP)
o	Radiation Protection Plan (RSP)/ALARA Plan
o	Final Status Survey Plan (FSSP)
"	Mobilization
"	Site-specific training (DOC personnel are expected to arrive on-site with appropriate occupational safety and radiation safety training at no cost to the government) 
"	Facility preparation/construction for basement access (if desirable) 
"	Remove reactor control console
"	Deconstruction/demolition of the reactor
o	Remove the reactor bridge and control rod drives 
o	Remove reactor tank internals and dismantle the core structure 
o	Remove the core assembly
o	Drain the pool and process the water from the reactor tank prior to discharge 
o	Remove the gunite layer from the reactor tank 
o	Remove the activated steel liner, concrete, and casing surrounding the reactor tank 
"	Characterize the remaining tank components 
"	Remove auxiliary systems from all reactor, laboratory, and storage areas
o	Water cooling and treatment system
o	Pneumatic transfer system
o	Fume hoods/drain lines
"	Decontaminate surfaces as necessary to meet release criteria
"	Package waste and arrange for disposal
o	Low-level radioactive waste
o	Mixed waste (contaminated lead)
o	Contaminated asbestos containing materials
o	Po-Be source
"	Manage disposition of Po-Be source described in the DP
"	Site restoration
"	Prepare Final Status Surveys and Report (FSSR)
"	Support for final NRC audit and Confirmatory Survey
The objective of this project is for the D&D project must be planned in accordance with the dose based release criteria for license termination given in 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 20, Subpart E, i.e. unrestricted release of the site.  These requirements are based on the 25 millirem per year (mrem/yr) dose limit specified in 10 CFR 20.1402 following physical removal of radioactive materials and surface decontamination final survey based on the Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM) methodology.  The unrestricted release criteria are to be achieved without a planned and significant delay period.   The Revised Draft Decommissioning Plan (DP) submitted by VA to the NRC on 8 Mar 2012, superseding the original 2003 DP.  This Revised Draft DP updated and incorporated responses to NRC's request for additional information (RAI) dated May 13, 2008.  This Revised Draft DP serves as the executive document that describes the objectives of the decommissioning program and identifies and defines the elements necessary to accomplish the program.  Final approval by NRC of this Revised Draft DP will be obtained prior to full mobilization for the D&D project. 

PROCUREMENT INFORMATION:

The proposed project will be a competitive, firm-fixed-price contract. The anticipated solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR Part 15, considering price, technical criteria and the price-related factors included in the RFP. However, the results and analysis of the market research will finalize the determination of the procurement method. The type of socio-economic set-aside, if any, will depend upon the responses to this notice and any other information gathered during the market research process.

The purpose of this Compatibility Check is to allow all vendors an opportunity to better prepare their proposals for the future GSS competition. <br> <br>

Manufacturers of potential GSS Competition candidates are invited to conduct a Compatibility Check using their own GSS systems with the Armys enablers. During the Compatibility Check, vendors will have time to check their attachment/detachment methods and take any necessary measurements needed with the Armys enablers. The Government will make the following enablers available for use at the Picatinny Arsenal facility:  M320/M320A1 Grenade Launcher (complete with M4 and M16 mounting hardware, along with standalone kit); M4A1 Carbine; M16A4 Rifle; M23 Blank Firing Adaptor; M68 Reflex Sight w/Mount; M150 Rifle Combat Optic;PEQ-2 Infared Aiming Laser; MILES Small Arms Transmitter (SAT); PEQ-15 (Laser/Light); PEQ-15A (Infrared Aiming Laser); and the AN-PSQ-23 (STORM) (Multi-functional laser system). <br> <br>

<h3>This is a non-firing Compatibility Check. </h3> Therefore, function firing of the various enablers will not be permitted, nor will batteries be provided for operation of the devices.  In addition, vendors participating in the Compatibility Check will not be furnished any ammunition, nor will they be allowed to bring their own ammunition to fire their weapons with any of the accessories, to include the Government-provided M320/M320A1 Grenade Launcher. <br>
 Each vendor will be allotted a time period of four (4) hours.  Additional visits and requests for time extensions will not be permitted. <h3>Compatibility checks will occur December 3rd thru 21st, 2012. </h3>  The Registration Period will be held from November 19th thru December 7th, 2012.  Scheduling for contractors to be provided access to the Army enablers will be established based on a first-come, first-served basis. The Compatibility Check will be held in Bldg 2 Lab, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806. <br> <br>
INSTRUCTIONS: Interested vendors must register to participate by contacting Holly Gregg, Contract Specialist, via email at, holly.c.gregg.civ@mail.mil.

During the Registration Period, each vendor will be assigned a time slot to conduct their Compatibility Check.   The amount of time for the Compatibility Check will be the same for all vendors:  four (4) hours maximum.  Vendors are allowed to bring multiple GSS candidate units.   A limit of three (3) representatives total from each vendor will be enforced due to limited room space. There will be no cost to the vendors attending the Compatibility Check associated with the use of Picatinny Arsenals facility. <br> <br>
No Government furnished property shall be removed from the Picatinny facility. Full accountability of the Government furnished property provided for this compatibility check will be maintained. <br> <br>
<h3>Note: The Government will not be responsible for any expenses incurred by a vendors decision to participate in the vendor Compatibility Check, nor will the Government be responsible for any damages incurred to a vendors weapon systems/equipment or injury to participants as a result of the Compatibility Check.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Additive manufacturing is the process of building 3D structures by sequentially layering one material on top of another in a desired pattern. It is a dramatic departure from more conventional fabrication techniques in which material is removed from a bulk piece through processes such as etching or machining. Over the last decade, additive manufacturing has become a burgeoning industry, enabling rapid prototyping of components for automotive, medical, and electronic applications. News headlines in recent years have showcased the often-remarkable capabilities of 3D printers that produce macroscale objects, such as a prototype musical instrument. Although specialized technologies are available for developing 3D structures with small, mesoscale (millimeter-length) features-hearing aids, for example-they are limited to a small number of materials as well as component size and shape specifications.<br /></span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Description:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Livermore materials scientists and engineers are designing and building new materials that will open up new spaces on many Ashby material selection charts, such as those for stiffness and density as well as thermal expansion and stiffness. This is being accomplished with unique design algorithms and research into the additive manufacturing techniques of projection microstereolithography, direct ink writing, and electrophoretic deposition.</span></p>

<RESPDATE>121712
<CONTACT>Jason Malak, Contract Specialist, Phone 407-208-3337, Email jason.malak@us.army.mil
<DESC><p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain information and solicit industry comment prior to issuing a competitive solicitation for the TIEDS effort.</p>
<p>Brief Summary: The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) Instrumentation Management Office (IMO) is performing market research to identify interested sources for a potential new contract for numerous efforts to support the objectives of IMO and its customers, including, but not limited to Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), other Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Project Management Offices (PMOs), Defense Laboratories, and other Defense Services and Agencies. IMO activities focus primarily on areas that would utilize a Services type contract vehicle, with the added ability to deliver instrumentation related hardware, software or integrated solutions.</p>
<p>Program Description: PM ITTS IMO requires a contract to address the acquisition life cycle of instrumentation related capabilities. TIEDS is geared towards the full spectrum of the instrumentation requirement, research, development, production, integration, and sustainment processes. TIEDS is expected to allow PM ITTS IMO to respond to evolving technology and military demands. The spectrum of services required range from requirements analysis and concept exploration to rapid prototyping, system development, system sustainment and other related tasks. A draft Statement of Work is included to help describe the requirements of this effort.</p>
<p>Acquisition Strategy: It is the Government's intent that the TIEDS program will be executed as a competitive award, and focused to the greatest extent on utilizing Small Businesses. The contract vehicle type has not been determined; however, the Government is contemplating a single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract.</p>
<p>Request For Information (RFI): Interested parties are requested to review the draft Statement of Work and provide your written responses by 12:00 PM EST on December 17, 2012. The Government is requesting specific responses to the information provided below:</p>
<p>Administrative:<br />a. Provide company name, points of contact with phone number, and e-mail. <br />b. Every page should have the company name, header, page numbers, date and if applicable the version number.<br />c. Technical: It is expected that the new TIEDS effort will fund Program Management functions through each individual Task Order and will not fund a separate Program Management Task Order.</p>
<p>i. Describe your approach to support Task Orders, sometimes with evolving requirements, as they arise. Include your process and approach to provide rough order of magnitude (ROM) on cost, schedule, and performance with expedient turnaround times. Include relevant technical history that demonstrates your technical skill sets from work completed.</p>
<p>ii. Describe your ability to operate in an Integrated Product Team (IPT) environment with the Government and/or its customer(s) to meet very short timelines to make decisions, meet documentation and programmatic suspenses, and execute acquisition tasks such as the ones listed below.</p>
<p>iii. Describe how you would manage an ID/IQ contract whereby all program management tasks are funded by individual Task Orders. There could be instances when a significant surge of program management efforts (proposal preparation, IPT coordination, etc.) is required. These surges could be random and without notice, yet require a quick turnaround (i.e. 4th quarter of the fiscal year). Identify your process for staffing and processing multiple proposals, while still managing current efforts. Describe your ability to surge to meet demands.</p>
<p>iv. Describe your approach to a Task Order that is complex (i.e., "research, propose, and price the development and life cycle sustainment of a cyber attack instrumentation system") and program management intensive versus a simple order that would be a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) procurement (i.e., "Purchase 15 qty item #123 radios from the lowest cost of three competing vendors"). <br />a. Describe the differences regarding managing a simple verse complex task order.<br />b. Differentiate your approach between the more complex tasks versus the simpler tasks, and discuss how you determine whether to perform the tasks "in-house" or via a subcontract.<br />c. Describe previous technical tasks that you have successfully completed that fit into a complex and simple category.</p>
<p><br />v. Describe your past performance with regard to lifecycle tasks associated with Test Instrumentation and related technologies including test data collection, reduction and analysis; real time casualty assessment (RTCA); and test design, planning, control, infrastructure, networks, and architecture.</p>
<p>Vendors interested in this opportunity are requested to email their response no later than 12:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on December 17, 2012 to:<br />Contract Specialist Mr. Jason Malak (jason.malak@us.army.mil)</p>
<p>Contractors are requested to provide a white paper not exceeding ten (10) pages double spaced, single sided, including the cover sheet. Font size shall not be smaller than industry standard word processor 12-point Times New Roman in a MS Word document.</p>
<p>In addition, contractors are invited to provide feedback on the draft SOW and Acquisition Strategy. Contractors are requested to provide comments not exceeding ten (10) pages, double spaced, single sided, including the cover sheet. Font size shall not be smaller than industry standard word processor 12-point Times New Roman in a MS Word document.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products or services nor will the Government reimburse any parties for costs associated with this request.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation shall not be issued. This requirement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code for this synopsis/solicitation is code 333314, Size Standard 500 employees.
<p><br />Solicitation number F2KBAD2212A002 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61, Effective 15 Oct 2012.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract for the following:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: High Sensitivity Optical Imager<br />DESCRIPTION: Keo Sentry 4" Scientific Imager, 8 position filterwheel, Pixis 2048B eXcelon.</p>
<p>The optical imager must meet the following specifications:</p>
<p>&bull; 1" or larger scientific grade-1 back-illuminated bare CCD detector with 2000x2000 or more pixels with 16 bit digitization. Peak quantum efficiency of 95% or better, with QE above 50% over the range of 400-700 nm and thermoelectric cooling to -70C or better, with lifetime guaranteed vacuum sealed chamber. Readout speed of 1 MHz or better, with 12 e- readout noise or better and dark current of 2e-3 e-/pix/sec or less. Detector shall be capable of on-chip binning to 256x256 super-pixels.<br /><br />&bull; Overall sensitivity of 10 Rayleigh or better<br /><br />&bull; Telecentric optics providing an effective f/# at the detector of 1.0 or less and narrow-band (2nm or less) filtering on the front end, matched efficiently to 4" filters on front end<br /><br />&bull; Telecentric front end optics compatible with 4" diameter narrow-band filters with 2 nm bandwidth and efficiently matched to detector optics <br /><br />&bull; Swappable front end optics providing the following fields of view: 15, 30, 60, and 90 degrees <br /><br />&bull; Automated computer-controlled temperature-stabilized filter wheel capable of holding 8 4"-diameter filters<br /><br />&bull; Automated integrated imager and filter wheel control software allowing pre-programmed automated operation and remote network access<br /><br />&bull; 2-nm passband 4" filters appropriate for observing emissions at the following wavelengths: 427.8, 557.7, 630.0, and 777.4 nm<br /><br />&bull; Automated high-reliability shutter with automatic light protection sensor<br /><br />&bull; High-speed USB interface<br /><br />&bull; Turn-key completely integrated system (front end optics, shutter, filter wheel, telecentric stages, re-imaging optics, and detector all mechanically secured to stand-alone chassis) optimized for observations of faint upper atmospheric phenomena. System shall be fully portable, weigh no more than approximately 100 lbs (in any one configuration-total weight including all possible front end optics and filters may be somewhat higher. 200 lbs maximum), fit within a 36"x24"x24" volume, and be sturdy enough to withstand frequent shipping and operation under field conditions without requiring realignment, disassembly, or reassembly. "Field conditions" refers to operation at remote sites with minimal infrastructure or support from trained personnel, typically from inside portable shelter with some climate control (temperature range 50-85 F) and viewing the sky through a dome. The sun shines directly onto the instrument through the dome during the day, which explains the need for an automatic light blocking shutter. The system is typically bolted to a wall or mechanically suspended from the ceiling below the dome. The area around the dome is covered with a black cloth to avoid stray light from inside the shelter getting into the lens, but the main part of the system can be expected to be exposed to at least some light during operation. A heavy system designed for a laboratory or dark room with parts of the optical train open to the room or needing an optical bench for support or alignment is not realistic. The system will operate at a single location anywhere from 2 weeks to multiple years, and generally the equipment is allowed to equilibrate to ambient conditions for 6 hours or more after opening the shipping boxes before actually operating it. No sudden temperature swings.<br /><br />&bull; System shall have mechanical mounting bracket sufficient to support weight of system in vertical or horizontal configuration. System shall be reliable enough to operate 24 hours per day for months at a time without requiring operator attention, and to be able to withstand daily operation (average 10 hours/day) for multiple years before failing or requiring replacement of mechanical components.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br />

<p>From this solicitation a single firm fixed priced, non-personal service contract is expected to be awarded to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The contract is expected to commence 15 Dec 2012 and will include a base year plus four option years. The Government has no obligation to exercise options, even though the options will be included in the overall price evaluation.</p>
<p>Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2: Evaluation of Commercial Items. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>a. Price - Award shall be made to the lowest priced offeror that is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government. The proposal shall include the proposed pricing for CLINs 0001 - 0005 in United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED), which includes the base year and four option years. The contractor need not propose a price for SubCLINs 0002AA - 0002AE.</p>
<p>NOTE: The number of visits required under CLIN 0001 will fluctuate depending on how often the Trane chillers break down. However, based on historical figures the offeror can anticipate five (5) service calls during the months May through October and two (2) service calls during the months November through April. The price for CLIN 0001 shall remain fixed regardless of how many emergency service trips are required. The number of trips could be greater or less than the seasonal averages, but the contractor shall be paid a fixed amount.</p>
<p>b. Quality Control Plan - The contractor must provide a Quality Control Plan in accordance with the criteria specified in Section 3 of the Performance Work Statement. The Contractors' Quality Control Plan will be deemed either "acceptable" or "unacceptable." Quality Control Plan acceptability will be based on whether it adequately addresses the performance objectives listed in Section 2 "Service Delivery Summary" of the PWS, as well as the criteria listed in Section 3. The Quality Control Plan must be determined realistic by Government technical experts in order to be acceptable.</p>
<p>c. Past Performance - The Government requires interested parties to send the attached Past Performance Questionnaire to at least two (2) clients who have received the same or similar service. Similar service is defined as work involving the same Trane chiller model, or a comparable alternative. The contracting officer must approve the comparable alternative. Only projects that have occurred within the previous three (3) years from the issuance of this solicitation shall be considered valid. Information should be provided detailing to which customers the contractor sent the Past Performance Questionnaire. Data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources will also be utilized by the Government during the past performance evaluation. The past performance will be deemed "acceptable" or "unacceptable." The past performance will be deemed acceptable if based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the requirement. <br /><br />d. Ability to Access the Base<br /><br />Please note that proposals submitted through e-mail should not exceed 9MB due to size limitations. The proposals should be broken into separate emails and labeled 1 of 5, 2 of 5, 3 of 5, etc. Any proposals that are late as a result of e-mail issues shall not be considered for award.

<p>52.24-403-70 Notice of Contractor Personnel Security Requirements (OCT 2005)<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) 1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.1. Long-Term<br />Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);</p>
<p>b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;</p>
<p>c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.<br />Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:</p>
<p>&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation</p>
<p>d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:</p>
<p>1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 2) Favorable fingerprint results; 3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:</p>
<p>a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; b. Favorable fingerprint results; c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and d.<br />Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.<br />This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelvemonth period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.</p>
<p>3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.</p>
<p>a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.</p>
<p>b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.</p>
<p>c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.</p>
<p>d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.</p>
<p>e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.</p>
<p>5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.<br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.</p>
<p>3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.<br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.</p>
<p>5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is<br />in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:
<p>This solicitation is being issued with the intention of awarding a Requirements-type contract for two shipboard-use forklifts; a 10K Rough Terrain (Lot I: CLINs 0001-0008) and a 20K Diesel (lot II: CLINs 0009-0016). The solicitation is fully competitive and will result in a fixed-price contract with economic price adjustments. The contract will be for five-years with no options. Each year will be considered a separate base year (base year 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) for the purposes of calculating the economic price adjustment. Solicitation Period: 45 days</p>
<p>There are two (2) lots included in this solicitation. Each lot will be evaluated and awarded separately, with the possibility of each lot being awarded to a different vendor or both lots be awarded to the same vendor. Each lot will also contain several Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs) line items, which must be separately priced (for each forklift) as a one-time fee, separate from the unit price for each forklift. The CDRLs to be priced separately include Hi-shock tests, EMI tests, Saline atmosphere tests, technical manuals, Maintenance Index Pages (MIPs) and Maintenance Requirements Cards (MRCs). These one-time fees will become payable under the first delivery order for each lot. The total estimated value for the proposed five year contract is $25,000,000.00. The contract will have a maximum limitation value of $37,500,000.00. Large business concerns must submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan along with their proposal.<br />An award will be made in accordance with the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures. The Government will make an award, as a result of this solicitation, on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost (technical) factors, for each lot. An award is anticipated by February of 2013.</p>
<p>Contractor First Article Testing (FAT) is required for each Lot, and there will be no waivers granted. The First Article Test (FAT) production lot shall consist of one (1) sample item for each of the two (2) forklifts listed. Clause 52.211-9037, which is contained in the solicitation, will specify the required delivery dates for the customer-direct (DVD) Delivery Orders. All Delivery Orders (DO) will require Inspection and Acceptance at Source (Origin). Product Verification Testing (PVT) may be invoked if a negative quality trend develops. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) will be required. Customer-Direct delivery orders will specify deliveries to both CONUS and OCONUS (via a containerization point) destination points.<br />Certified cost and pricing data may be required per FAR 15.403-4. The Contracting Officer may utilize On-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussion under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a Reverse Auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using Reverse Auctioning as a pricing technique.<br /><br />This acquisition is subject to the requirements of the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>All proposals must include a hard copy of a completed solicitation with price and delivery data for all CLINS under each lot (that can be provided). Follow directions as outlined in the solicitation. Offerors responding to the solicitation must submit their proposal to the Business Opportunities Office (BOO), address will be shown on page 7 of the solicitation.

(b) When using the lowest price technically acceptable process, the following apply: 
(1) The evaluation factors and significant subfactors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the solicitation. Solicitations shall specify that award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. If the contracting officer documents the file pursuant to 15.304(c)(3)(iii), past performance need not be an evaluation factor in lowest price technically acceptable source selections. If the contracting officer elects to consider past performance as an evaluation factor, it shall be evaluated in accordance with 15.305. However, the comparative assessment in 15.305(a)(2)(i) does not apply. If the contracting officer determines that a small business? past performance is not acceptable, the matter shall be referred to the Small Business Administration for a Certificate of Competency determination, in accordance with the procedures contained in subpart 19.6 and 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)). 
(2) Tradeoffs are not permitted.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

7R 1680 015975782 V2, P/N 901-005-662-101.  This item is certified 3C to cage 97499.  This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity  
in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified   
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or   
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.
 The  
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as   
the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are 
not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on 
your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if    
this is an item you have never made.                                          

 If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS 
 submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request 
 for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required  
 by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data    
 required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award      
 under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval      
 request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval        
 requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet      
 Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based   
 on Fleet support needs.  The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification

<p>&nbsp;<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Additional Questions and Answers:<br /><br />QUESTION -&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it correct that the hole size is 3/4" diameter, and the vertical holes are spaced on a 1" center line?
<p>ANSWER - This information is correct. 3/4 inch holes and spaced on 1 " centers.</p>
<p>QUESTION - What is the actual length of the Polyurethane blade 20' or 17'? Is the blade supplied as one continuous blade, or does it come in sections?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the picture, it appears that the holes are placed on what is known as "standard highway spacing" of 3" . . . 3" . . . 12" . . . 12" -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>12" . . . 12" . . . 3" . . .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>3"; we need to confirm that this is the correct spacing. While not visible in the picture, I suspect that vertically, there are three sets of holes to allow for repositioning of the blade as it wears.</p>
<p>ANSWER - That is the correct spacing (STANDARD HIGHWAY SPACING), The segments are in 10' lengths and blade length is 20 feet. When you angle the blade that is the (cut measurement of 17 feet), The vertical holes are for adjustment when the blades wears and are spaced on 1 " centers.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<DESC>CURE BREAKWATER National Park Service Denver Major Acquisitions Buying Office (MABO) Lakewood, Colorado 80228 11/13/2012
This is Amendment # 1 to Solicitation Q1379130007. The purpose of this Amendment is to note questions, and responses for questions that arose at the site visit or as may have been presented up to the date of this Amendment posting.   This amendment also corrects the Contracting Officers email address as indicated in section 22 of the original solicitation.  The Contracting Officers email address is joseph_gatlin@nps.gov.  (see section 22 at the end of this amendment.)
QUESTIONS WITH RESPONSES.  
1)      Will any preliminary staging of materials be permitted at the Stevens Creek jobsite prior to the May 15 work window opening?
Answer:  Yes, the park will designate a staging area.  Staging may occur no earlier than May 1, 2013.  No staging will be allowed untill after 10 am, on any given day prior to May 15, due to Grouse LEK.  
2)      The current lake level is such that the entire attenuator string at Stevens Creek is aground.  If the lake remains at this level through next June, is it expected that the new attenuator float be installed in the same hard-aground condition?
Answer:  The new attenuators need to be installed, floating on the water and anchored appropriately regardless of the water level at the time of installation.   The anchoring system at Stevens Creek and Iola needs to have the ability to accomodate full pool and low water situations.
3)      Are there any restrictions on operation of equipment (wheeled or tracked) on the dry lakebed at Stevens Creek?
Answer:  Equipment can be operated below high water mark, at the contractor's own risk.  Any scarring shall be repaired at contractor's own expense.  
4)      Are there any restrictions on excavations that might be required to create anchor points at either site?
Answer: Yes, After the site locations have been determined, the NPS will evaluate for approval.  The NPS staff Archaeologist will monitor prior, during and after if applicable.  Other than any archaeological concerns, there will be no excavation restrictions below the high water level.  
5)      The existing shoreward anchor point at Stevens Creek is a cast-in-place concrete deadman below grade.  Is it required that the new shoreward anchor points also be below grade?
Answer:  Yes
6)      Are there any topographic / bathymetric surveys available for either site?
Answer:  None are available at this time.  
7)      Are there any restrictions on the width of the new attenuator floats?
Answer:  none other than the allowable width of a loaded truck on a public highway.
8)      Is retrieval of existing underwater anchors included in this scope of work?
Answer:  No
9)      Is there a desired quantity of nav / marker lights?
Answer:  The number and quantity of nav/marker lights depends on US Coast Guard Requirements.  The Scope of Work indicates;   "The lighting system shall meet appropriate requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard, National Electric Code and any other applicable codes and regulations."
10)   What is the required completion date for work at both sites?
Answer:  No specific project completion date has been established but is preferrd that completion be on or before June 28, 2013 due to high park and water usage/traffic prior to and during the 4th of July holiday period.  
11) If low was present when installing new breakwater, could land type equipment be used.  
Answer:  Equipment can be operated below high water mark, at the contractor's own risk.  Any scarring shall be repaired at contractor's own expense.  . 
12)  Does the park want a walkway on the breakwater?
Answer:  The scop of work does not currently identify the need or lack of need for a walkway on the breakwater.  The contractor should provide their offering and the NPS will make a best value decision, based upon each contractor's offer.  Note:  all winches shall be accessable and, safe conditions and access shall be provided for safe operation.  
13)  Can contractor use existing dead man anchor if needed?
Answer:  The solicitation requires all new anchors.  The existing anchors are in poor condition and will not be reused.  
14)  Can contractor use dozer on banks to help install new breakwater?  
Answer:  Yes, but any disturbed areas must be restored to pre-contract conditions at the contractor's own expense.
Concerning the IOLA location:
15)  Question asked about having 3 to 4 anchor points along the bank to move breakwater as water levels arise or fall?
Answer:  The contractor shall provide their offering and the NPS will make a best value decision based on each contractor's offer.

<DESC><p>The combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items for Solicitation Number: SOL-CI-12-00049 which was posted on October 29, 2012 is amended to reflect a change to the Performance Work Statement as well as to respond to vendor questions.</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong>&nbsp; Relative to the Performance Work Statement, any and all references to ""aerostat system" shall be changed to "aerial system". The change will be reflected in the award document when award is made.&nbsp; Please also see change to Title" of this combined synopsis/solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> The following questions were received in response to the combined synopsis/solicitation. Answers are provided below each question.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1</span>. In order to properly account for density altitude effects and to offer the appropriately sized lighter-than-air system, can the EPA provide the highest means sea level elevation the system will be operated from?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> 5,500 feet<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2</span>. Under Minimum General Specifications there is a requirement "of lofting an approximately 23 kg payload to heights up to 300m". What is the maximum ground elevation and temperature?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> ~5,500 feet, ~100 dgrees F<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3</span>. Having read the minimum general specifications, the Contractor is concerned that the EPA is potentially requesting an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system based on the following descriptions, "aerial system must be maneuverable at a user-controlled altitude and coordinates either via electronic or non-carbon fuel self-propulsion" and on the phrasing of &lsquo;or' a "ground-based tether on a mobile platform." For untethered systems, has the EPA considered the restrictions imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding the operation of UAVs in domestic airspace?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 4</span>. The requirements state that the system must be capable of being transported in a 20' trailer. Must the Contractor assume that for systems comprised of a lighter-than-air envelope, that the system is inflated or deflated?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Deflated.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 5</span>. Does the trailer transport requirement referred to in question #3 include pressurized gasses and storage, winch, and ground control station components? <br /><strong>Answer:</strong> All but the gases.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 6</span>. The structural requirements require a "quick change payload amount, allowing change out in less than two minutes." Can the EPA provide drawings and additional detail about the payload to allow the contractor to design a mount?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> A similar payload is described in detail in Aurell, et al., Chemosphere. 2011 Oct, 85(5):806-811. This payload was attached with three main lines and 6-8 others, all taut, to Quicklinks on an aluminum frame.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 7</span>. Will the EPA supply its own ground control station for the payload system?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 8</span>. The requirements mention operation of system components off of a trailer or an ATV using a winch weighing no more than 150 lbs. This requirement creates concerns that the winch weight alone would be insufficient to anchor the system safely. Is the Contractor expected to provide a means to secure the winch system to a specific vehicle? If so, what are the requirements for attachment? <br /><strong>Answer:</strong> The Contractor is not expected to provide the means of securing the winch to the mobile platform other than providing a reasonable base with which to do so. The winch weight is a desired amount.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 9</span>. The Contractor is concerned that the lift generated by sudden wind gusts or rapid changes in local weather could generate sufficient lift or drag to present a significant operator hazard. What human safety factors has the EPA considered for aerostat operation tethered to an ATV, Gator, or like system?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> The EPA's mobile system (ATV, etc.) must, of course, be of sufficient weight and durability to counter anticipated wind gusts.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 10</span>. Will the EPA consider a proposed aerostat system that can remain aloft for significantly longer than 2 hours and provide continuous payload power on more favorable or more preferential terms for exceeding specifications?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 11</span>. Under Minimum Operational Requirements it is not clear what is applicable to tethers aerostats versus RPVs. Does a weathervaning tethered aerostat meet all of the manoeuverability, controllability, and positioning requirements?&nbsp; <br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Potentially, yes, although the EPA is not familiar with the performance of such devices. The vendor should provide sufficient documentation to enable EPA to determine that the minimum specifications are met by the proposed device.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 12</span>. Under Minimum Operational Requirements one bullet has a requirement for the winch to be "capable of 0 to 50 m/min, while another bullet states "can be retrieved from 150 m altitude within 2 min" or 75 m/min. What is the maximum winch speed required and what is the assumed maximum wind speed for this performance?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> 50 m/min</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 13</span>. Under Minimum Operational Requirements there is a requirement for a "Battery operated (use of 12 V) electric winch...". Is it acceptable to use a supplemental generator to meet the speed requirements listed above?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 14.</span> Under Minimum Operational Requirements there is a requirement for "flight-tolerant of turbulence such as that expected from open fire thermals such as forest fires." Will this level of turbulence be defined, and will an analysis be required to validate the system operates in the defined conditions?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> An analysis will not be required. Past operations have encountered an extreme case of a 7G force.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 15</span>. Will a tethered aerostat be subject to the FAA FAR 101 requirements for tether markings? If so will the weight of the flags and/or strobes be counted as part of the payload weight?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> This will be site-dependent. The markings will be counted against the payload capacity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 16</span>. Will the system be expected to operate in day and night conditions?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Day only.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 17</span>. For a tethered aerostat systems, is there a requirement for the aerostat to be flying while the gator is driving? If so, what is the maximum required speed and the maximum distance it will travel?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, approximately 5 mph, but only for distances of 500 feet or less, the exception being the situation in which the system was being transported for short (~2 miles) distances to a different site location but with the payload optional.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> All of other terms and conditions posted in the original combined synopsis/solicitation remain unchanged.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br />NONE NONE <br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice with market research questions attached. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified small businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 (please see attached market research questions). No solicitation is being issued at this time. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado, seeks potential sources, with specific interest in small business capability, to perform Hardness Maintenance/Hardness Surveillance (HM/HS) and High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Technical Support for Headquarters, Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC), Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado. This requirement provides HM/HS, HEMP verification testing, HEMP surveys and engineering studies, and HEMP training materials for a wide range of current HEMP protection systems world-wide (see attached draft PWS). The contractor shall furnish all labor, tools, equipment, and material necessary to accomplish the requirements. Work under this contract will require security clearances of Secret and Top Secret. For reference purposes, the solicitation, when issued, will be numbered FA2517-12-R-9006 and will be a Request for Proposal (RFP). A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection. It is anticipated the contract(s) will have a five-year performance period. The program is valued at approximately $12 million. This HEMP protection program spans across various mission systems, sites and facilities. The Government is contemplating award of one firm fixed price contact. The Government has determined that the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code most appropriate for this procurement is 517110, Wired Communications Carriers. The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. No decision has yet been made regarding the small business strategy for this contract. Small businesses wishing to influence the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s decision regarding a small business set-aside are urged to respond to this announcement and the attached market research questions via e-mail to jeane.steed@us.af.mil. If this procurement results in a small business set-aside, small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, would apply wherein at least 50 percent of the work must be performed by the small business prime contractor alone. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this notice or any follow-up information requests is voluntary and shall be treated as confidential. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. All amendments will be available for viewing at this website, FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.eps.gov. It is incumbent upon interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. Although a deviation is currently in place for registration in the System for Award Management (SAM), formerly Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and for FAR 52.204-8, Annual Representations and Certifications, offerors should note this deviation is provisional, and requirements for registration in this system at http://www.sam.gov will recommence at some point. Your response to the attached market research questions is certainly appreciated.

<DESC>The government received a large number of responses to this RFI; in all cases the responses, although very informative, presented a very similar approach and technology stack that helped validate the results of many months of market research and conversations with other Government Agencies and Financial Regulatory Units. Based on this validation, the government plans to take a phased approach to developing the overarching solution and continue building on its current environment. <br /><br />It appears that no single technology/solution answers all the requirements and no new or unexpected alternative solutions were presented; the path forward will be to build the integration layers and expand current capability in a way that some of the technology options will "bolt on" to the existing infrastructure and additional capability will be added discretely and methodically to solve specific requirements as needed.
<p>It is anticipated that solicitations will be issued for "add on" capability components based on specific requirements and for the hardware and software required to expand the current environment. The government will continue to research and analyze the emerging technologies and may in the near future issue a more comprehensive solicitation.</p>

<p><br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing neutron velocity selectors used for the filtering of beam-line thermal neutrons.<br />&nbsp;<br />Specifically, NIST seeks information about neutron velocity selectors that can filter a rectangular neutron beam that is 6.5 cm wide and 15 cm high, and can selectively pass neutrons over a wavelength range of 3.1 Angstroms to 1.2 Angstroms (8.5 meV to 58 meV). The minimum peak beam transmission at +/-0.005 rad divergence is 80%. This neutron velocity selector will be used to pre-monochromate an incident neutron beam; pyrolytic graphite or Cu monochromators will still be employed to provide the narrow wavelength selection needed for the intended use on a triple-axis neutron scattering instrument. <br /><br />Available physical space is very limited for this velocity selector due to required shielding. Maximum dimensions are 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm (LxWxH), with no requirement to be symmetric about the neutron beam-line. Length is defined along the horizontal neutron beam-line, width is defined perpendicular to the neutron beam-line and height is defined perpendicular to the beam-line in the vertical direction. Maximum dimensions are total lengths in the stated directions, and these total lengths include mounting fixtures, electrical and water connections, etc. <br /><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a neutron velocity selector that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.<br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice. <br /><br />Companies that manufacture such selectors are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications (including specifications for neutron velocity selectors that exceed the requirements above) and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: <br /><br />1. Name of the company that manufactures the selector for which specifications are provided. <br />2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the selector, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). <br />3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such selectors. <br />4. Indication of whether each selector for which specifications are provided is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). <br />5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

BACKGROUND - The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Western Ecology Division (WED) Plant Ecology Laboratory building in Corvallis is a one story structure with a mechanical penthouse constructed in 1984 and is served by two 750mbtu Burnham PF504.  Boiler #2 has been removed.  Rather than expending the cost of repair, EPA WED has elected for replacement with high efficiency condensing boilers to conserve energy.
EPA?s WED Corvallis laboratory building is a two story structure constructed in 1966 and is served by two 3,000mbtu Hurst boilers.  Boiler #1 needs to be re-tubed.  Rather than expending the cost for repair, EPA?s WED has elected for replacement with high efficiency condensing boilers to conserve energy.
The EPA WED?s Newport Laboratory building was constructed in the 1994.  The original HVAC heating design utilized heat pumps and was replaced in 2005 with three hydronic natural gas fired boiler units that service the 38,000 sf main building.  These units are RBI model DB1500?s each and are control automated.  The existing units reside in a small detached concrete block structure.  Because of the size of the existing horizontal units, it is not possible to remove a unit through the 48? door without first removing the center unit that blocks the door.  The current exhaust stack and piping will need to be isolated so that the remaining unit will continue to provide service.  Contractor shall ensure that the remaining boiler in the Newport facility provides heating and shall also provide a temporary boiler for heating until the new units are fully functional and can provide heating.  
B.  SCOPE - Boiler replacement and installations at US EPA's Western Ecology Division (WED) requires installation at two locations and in three separate buildings.  This project is to supply two (2) 1,000mbtu high efficiency condensing boilers for the Plant Ecology Building.  This project is also to install and commission a total of six (6) boilers: 1) - Two (2) Lochinvar Crest FBN 2000 Government Furnish Equipment (GFE), 2) - Two (2) Lochinvar Crest FBN 1500 boilers Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), and 3) - Two (2) 1,000mbtu high efficient condensing boilers that shall be purchased and supplied by the contractor.  This project also includes the removal and disposal of: one existing boiler at the EPA WED?s Plant Ecology Building; two boilers at the EPA WED?s Corvallis Laboratory facility; and two boilers at the EPA WED?s Newport Laboratory facility.  Lastly, the project requires commissioning and testing of all six boilers as required by Oregon State Code.  See Attachmen t # 3, Statement of Work, for the full scope of work for this requirement, Government and contractor responsibilities, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and the projected period of performance.  See Attachment # 4 for facilities? boiler sheets and floor plans.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS - The Statement of Work (SOW), Evaluation Criteria, Pricing Sheet and any other information pertaining to this requirement can only be found at the EPA website listed at the end of this synopsis/solicitation.  The evaluation factors for this requirement are: 1) - Past Performance; 2) - Technical Capability; and 3) - Price (See Attachment # 2, Provisions and Clauses, FAR 52,212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items for details).

<DESC>** THE TIME OF THIS PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE HAS BEEN MOVED FORWARD ONE HOUR. THOSE ENTITIES WHO HAVE ALREADY REGISTERED WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THIS CHANGE BY EMAIL. **<br /><br /><br />The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for U.S. Mission Germany. The U.S. Mission Germany requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement.

<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.</p>
<p>Due to the large dollar value and complexity of the U.S. Mission Germany Local Guard Program, the Department of State has determined the need to conduct a pre-solicitation conference before releasing the solicitation for this requirement. This conference will be used to highlight key areas of the solicitation, discuss issues that may affect prospective offerors ability to manage this contract, and show prospective slides of the place of performance (i.e., specific guard posts) of locations covered by this requirement in lieu of an actual "site visit" to each respective location. ATTENDANCE AT THIS PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE IS MANDATORY for any offeror who wants to submit a proposal for this requirement. This conference will be held at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, Germany at <strong>1:00 PM</strong> local on November 15, 2012.</p>
<p>Offerors interested in attending must preregister by contacting Amanda Rogers, rogersan@state.gov no later than 4:00 pm EDT, November 13, 2012. No more than three (3) representatives from each interested offeroring firm (to include potential joint venture partners) may attend the pre-proposal conference. Interested offerors shall provide the name (s) of the representative (s) who will attend the conference, name of the representing firm, address of the firm, telephone number of each person attending and DUNS number of the firm that will be the primary contractor. Each attendee of the conference SHALL PRESENT TWO FORMS OF PICTURE IDENTIFICATION confirming identity. Those representatives unable to present two forms of identification SHALL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. Preregistration is MANDATORY. Interested offerors are solely responsible for ALL expenses resulting from this announcement (i.e. travel, lodging, per diem, proposal costs and other miscellaneous expenses, etc.) and are responsible for confirming all dates specified in this announcement by immediately checking the solicitation when posted on www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov to see if there are any changes.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates posting the U.S. Mission Germany solicitation on this site approximately fifteen (15) days after the pre-solicitation conference. No paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and any change will be posted on this site.</p>
<p>Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Amanda N. Rogers at rogersan@state.gov PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the best technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS THE NOTICE RELATED TO SOURCES SOUGHT HSCG50-12-R-EVRAES.</p>
<p>ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO SEPARATE Request for Proposal (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.</p>
<p>1. Small Business.</p>
<p>This proposed contract is a partial small business reserve in accordance with FAR 19.502-4(a) as one or more contracts will be reserved for this multiple-award procurement. The appropriate NAICS for this contract is 541330. The small business size standard classification for this contract is $14,000,000. Award will be made to up to seven of the most highly qualified firms and one or more contracts will be reserved for a qualified small business. The determination of which firms are the most highly qualified will be based on a subjective assessment of the evaluation board on the firm's ability to meet the evaluation criteria included in the synopsis. A firm, either large or small, must at least meet the evaluation criteria to be considered "most highly qualified." If no small businesses are determined to be "most highly qualified," then no award will be made to a small business. Additionally, nothing prevents more than one small business being awarded a contract in the event they are more qualified than other large businesses. The highest ranked large and small businesses will then be invited to discussions. The number of firms invited for discussions will be sufficient such that up to seven IDIQ contracts may be awarded. A small business may be chosen over a higher ranked large business in order to meet the intent of the small business reservation. A small business will not be invited to a discussion if it cannot be determined most highly qualified by the evaluation board.<br />The general intent of task orders will not be to set them aside for small business should a small business be awarded a contract, however, the Government may set task orders aside in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F). <br />Large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan upon submission of their cost proposal should they be chosen for contract award. Small businesses will be required to comply with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.<br />Firms should state the words (LARGE BUSINESS) or (SMALL BUSINESS) in parentheses after the name of firm in PART I, A Block 5 of form SF 330. If a firm is competing for this contract as a joint venture, the firm must submit legal documentation along with their SF 330 documenting their status as a joint venture. The joint venture must also be registered in www.SAM.gov at the time of SF 330 submission. The legal documentation verifying the joint venture will not be considered part of the page limit for SF 330 submission.</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Due to the US Army acquisition engineering and lifecycle management processes followed by this program, and the fact that the system is currently in Limited Rate Initial Production (LRIP), there cannot be any substitute hardware that would affect</span></p>

There have been five systems handed over to the end line user, and any changes to equipment that would affect functionality would alter the logistics readiness of the system. This item is needed to meet the requirements of the system as designed and a substitution would alter the baseline thereby affecting the logistics readiness and finalized drawing package approved by the customer. Any variation would warrant an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) as well as modifications in the field to include the logistics readiness of the system. Fluke is the only vendor that makes the 52120A amplifier to the USMC specifications.</span></p>

<DESC>Control # 13-03<br />JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. CONTRACTING AGENCY: USACE Portland District (CECT-NWP-S), Supply/Services Branch.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: Request for approval for a Firm-Fixed Price purchase for Lagoon Pumping Services, using FY13 Operations and Maintenance funds.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The contractor will provide an efficient means of removing sludge (&gt;4% solids by weight) and other organic material such as tree debris efficiently and safely. Sludge will be removed and spread evenly in an adjacent one acre field. Equipment will be capable of removing and evenly spreading 3,000 gallons of sludge/hour or more.</p>
<p>4. AUTHORITY CITED: In accordance with statutory authority, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2(a)(2) "Unusual and Compelling Urgency."</p>
<p>5. REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED:</p>
<p>(1) Background: The Sewage lagoon is located less than 250 feet north of the Middle Fork of the Willamette River 1,500 feet west of Dexter Dam. The Oregon Department of Environmental quality (ODEQ) is concerned about raw sewage leaks from the aging facility entering ground water and the waters of the adjacent river.</p>
<p>The facility is operated by the Oregon State Parks (OSP) to treat waste form nearby Lowell State Park. The facility no longer receives sewage from the park as they have directed the sewage to the nearby City of Lowell wastewater treatment plant. OSP continues to pay an annual $2,000 permit fee for the Dexter lagoon facility whether in use or not. OSP does not have the budget to formerly decommission the facility.</p>
<p>In mid August the Corps, OSP, and ODEQ met on-site to discuss the fate of lagoon. It was determined that the Corps would take the lead in removing the material in the pond and sterilizing the plant. To accomplish the mission 300,000 gallons of untreated water would be removed and approximately 130,000 gallons of sludge tested and applied to an upland site adjacent to the facility. Irrigation of the water and land application of the sludge area only permitted between April 1st and October 31st at this site. Irrigation began immediately.</p>
<p>The Willamette Valley Project initiated a VISA purchase for pumping service of the sewage lagoon. It was estimated that $2,500 would cover this service. Due to staffing shortages and unexpected site conditions the trash pump work took longer than expected and was assumed compete with only 10,000 gallons estimated on the 12 October 2012. A vacuum truck arrived on 16 October 2012 to find several inches of rainfall had collected in the pond. The contractors (Roto Rooter) worked diligently but could not complete the job in the allotted time due to the increase in volume from rainfall. The work stopped and was put on hold pending conversion of the VISA purchase to a contract.</p>
<p>By 1 October 2012 the water was removed and the sludge layer tested. The land application site was approved by ODEQ and the land application began on the 5th of October.<br />The plan was to remove the majority of the material with trash pumps and have a vacuum truck cleanup the last few thousand gallons. After this the lagoon would be sterilized with a bleach solution and the land application site would be disced with a tractor to integrate the sludge to the upland soils.</p>
<p>The level of the lagoon was too low and the material too thick to use trash pumps to finish the work effectively. A vacuum truck was needed to pump the remaining sewage from the lagoon. A vacuum truck is not available for project staff to rent.</p>
<p>(2) Justification: Roto Rooter was the only contractor within the area with a vacuum truck that could perform the pumping services. They were already on location but stopped work as the Project approached its $2,500.00 spending limit on their Government Purchase Card.</p>
<p>(3) Impact: Without the urgent services provided by Roto Rooter the sewage lagoon was at risk of collecting rain water adding to the volume of existing sludge which would have resulted in an increase in work/funds at a later date. In addition the rain would have caused the land applied sludge to runoff into adjacent bodies of water creating an environmental health risk. To lock the sludge in the land application site, tilling of the soil was required. This work is only feasible and effective after all the sludge is applied. Costs for project staff and rental equipment to perform tilling operation twice would have been an additional $1,200 to $1,500, and the runoff and subsequent surface water contamination would be unavoidable with two tillings.</p>
<p>(4) Alternatives: There were no other alternatives for this requirement. Project staff made every attempt to complete this work in a reasonable and timely manner.</p>
<p>6. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: Willamette Valley Project staff attempted to rent a vacuum truck to remove the waste from the sewage lagoon, but no trucks were available. A trash pump was an unacceptable option as that would pose a health risk to the project staff and is not as efficient as a vacuum truck. Roto Rooter contractors have the training and equipment to efficiently perform the work. Roto Rooter was the only vendor within the area with a vacuum truck of sufficient size to perform the task available for use during the time required.</p>
<p>7. ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION: No actions to increase competition have been taken. Ongoing market research will be conducted for any future requirements.</p>
<p>8. MARKET RESEARCH: In order to conduct the pumping operation within the time period the truck would need at least a 4" discharge and vacuum line to handle all the sludge and other organic material. A tank of more than 3,500 gallon capacity allows for a more sustained pumping operation without having to reverse the pump to discharge. There were no other contractors available on short notice in the area with equivalent equipment. Local septic pumping contractor Best Septic has a 3,000 gallon truck but would take more time to perform work.</p>
<p>9. INTERESTED SOURCES: The Notice required by FAR 5.201 will be published, and any bids or proposals received shall be considered for future requirements.</p>
<p>10. OTHER FACTS: Roto Rooter was the only company that could satisfy this requirement. The cost of this requirement is $5,096.75. The total hours are 17.33 at $294.10 an hour for a total of $5,096.75. A delay in acquiring services from Roto Rooter would result in an increase of funds due to weather (rain) increasing the amount of gallons of sewage to be pumped from the lagoon. In addition the rain would have caused the land applied sludge to runoff into adjacent bodies of water creating an environmental health risk.</p>
