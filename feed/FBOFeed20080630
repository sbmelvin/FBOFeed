USDA, ARS, Robert W. Holley Center for Agriculture and Health has determined
that Waters Corporation&rsquo;s SYNAP HDMS is the only equipment with the following
salient characteristics: </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">The SYNAPT HDMS is the only commercially available Q-TOF
mass spectrometry system that includes an ion mobility separation (Triwave)
device<strong> </strong>consisting of three traveling
wave ion guides. Two of these can function as collision cells enabling MS<sup>3</sup> operation which provides superior structural characterizations. The ion
mobility feature of the SYNAPT HDMS system is extremely important because when
combined with the mass resolution of &gt; 17,000 FWHM, it can be utilized to
eliminate the problems associated with the analysis of isobaric or nearly
isobaric ions. Furthermore, the Triwave device is necessary in order to carry out
Time Aligned Parallel (TAP) (Matrix)<strong> </strong>fragmentation.
Through TAP fragmentation and the Waters proprietary software incorporated in
MassLynx and ProteinLynx Global Server one can largely mitigate the problems
introduced by the phenomenon of &ldquo;peptide under sampling&rdquo;, greatly increasing protein
and proteome coverage while<span>&nbsp; </span>improving one&rsquo;s
ability to carry out quantitative studies of protein expression. The mass
accuracy of this system (&lt; +/- 2 ppm) is sufficient to define the elemental
composition of the precursor and fragment ions uniquely, providing superior
identifications. The scan rate of 10 full scans/sec. is sufficient to fully
define chromatographic peaks with peak widths of 2-3 seconds such as those
generated by our nanoUPLC. Furthermore, the operating system of this mass
spectrometer is fully compatible and integrated with the operating system of
the existing Waters&rsquo; nanoUPLC allowing for their joint operation through a
single computer interface.&nbsp; Available with 3 traveling wave ion guides (TriWave Device);
Ability to carry out ion mobility separations, Ability to carry out Time Aligned
Parallel Fragmentation experiments, Comes standard with e and two collision
cells for MS-3; Ability to carry out 10 MS/MS scans per second; Better than 2
ppm mass accuracy; Includes Trade-In of Government-owned Mass Lynx Software. Mass
resolution of better than 17000 FWHM.<span> </span>Electronically
compatible with existing Waters nanoUPLC System. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">PACKING AND SHIPPING - </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">The Contractor shall pack each item for shipment in a new

<DESC><p>Davis-Monthan AFB AZ plans to contract with Soaring Heights Communities for maintenance of 32 military family housing units for a period of two months, at which point Soaring Heights Communities is expected to assume ownership of these units. Contracting without providing for full and open competition is permitted in this case by the following exception to the requirement at FAR Subpart 6.1 -- Full and Open Competition: 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Given the nature of the requirement (skilled trades labor, on-site presence required, 24/7 availability, etc.), its small size, and the anticipated short period of performance, plus the fact that Soaring Heights Communities has the necessary on-site infrastructure as it performs the identical service for its own units, it would be impractical for anyone else to perform it. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement and is not a request for competitive proposals. Firms wishing to challenge the sole source award must submit information demonstrating the ability to provide the above services (to include one-hour response to emergency service calls 24 hours per day, 7 days per week). Electronic responses may be submitted to arthur.perry@dm.af.mil. Fax response may be sent to (520) 228-5462. Responses will be evaluated only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement; however, a decision not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not reimburse for any costs associated with providing capability information.</p>

<DESC>1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot Schools 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.

BRAND NAME UNIQUE JUSTIFICATIONFOR MICROFOCUS SOFTWARE SUPPORTFA8771-08-R-0022

IWIMS system has a requirement for technical support for MICROFOCUS COBOL to maintain the legacy program for patches, upgrades and technical support which supports the Air Force's Civil Engineers.  It is imperative that the developmental environment matches the operational environment to ensure completeness in testing.   Without the purchase of this software and its associated maintenance, the required testing before fielding new software and/or system architecture changes would not be able to take place.  This could adversely affect Civil Engineers Air Force-wide with the introduction of new software and/or system architecture changes that are not thoroughly tested.  The Government's minimum needs can only be satisfied with the purchase of this hardware and maintenance.  This purchase allows the developmental environment to match the operational environment.   A failure to purchase specified software and maintenance would prevent the 754 ELSG from meeting current customer r! equirements of thoroughly tested changes to software and system architecture.

<CONTACT>Daniel  Urban daniel.urban@hanscom.af.mil

<a href="mailto:daniel.urban@hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>The sustainment of Eagle Vision Data Integration Segment (DIS) systems will include: hardware maintenance, software maintenance, security accreditation, configuration management, systems engineering, training, and potential updates to the DIS commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software and hardware baseline.  This effort will also include the procurement of a complete DIS system for EV 6 and a configured laptop for Air Force Director of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Applications (AF/A2U) located at the Pentagon.
Eagle Vision is the only deployable commercial ground station in DOD that can directly receive and process panchromatic/multispectral/SAR imagery from commercial remote-sensing satellites.  Eagle Vision provides imagery products for military operations, disaster relief and homeland defense, especially for use in combat commander mission planning/rehearsal and intelligence gathering systems.  DIS imagery processing includes both industry standard and government-specific output formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG 2000, NITF 2.1, and RPF CIB.
The DIS resides at each of five geographically-separated Eagle Vision sites: Ramstein Air Base Germany, San Diego, CA, Eastover, SC, Honolulu, HI, and Montgomery, AL.  Each DIS system (except for EV 6 and AF/A2U) comprises six independent workstations (mix of desktops and laptops), a Local Area Network (LAN), shared storage devices, printers, and plotters.  Each workstation contains multiple commodity COTS applications software for imagery, office automation, and geospatial processing applications, including ERDAS Imagine and ESRI ArcGIS.  The sustainment effort will also support one workstation configured with all DIS software at AF/A2U, once those systems are procured.  Additional informational about the locations and hardware/software configuration of the DIS systems may be found on the Hanscom Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB), http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/.  Under business opportunities, choose systems/Hanscom for type and location.  The information ! can be found under Eagle Vision Data Integration Segment (DIS).

<DESC><p><br />538th ACSG has a requirement for contractor support to sustain and modify all configurations of the A-10 weapon system. The A-10 is expected to remain in AF inventory until at least 2028. This poses unique challenges in maintaining mission capability for an aging aircraft flying well beyond its original life expectancy. All task orders under this contract will fall into two primary areas: sustainment and development requirements.
<p>Sustainment is the ongoing activities and resources required to maintain mission capability, and improve mission readiness and effectiveness of the A-10 weapon system throughout its life cycle. The contractor shall perform sustainment activities as directed by task order in the technical/functional areas of avionics, structures, mechanical systems, and software. The contractor shall be capable of supporting a variety of sustainment activities in each technical/functional area including form, fit, or function changes to existing components and/or systems as a result of diminishing manufacturing sources or materiel shortages, obsolescence, reliability improvements, maintainability concerns, integrity program evaluations, failure analysis, or directed efforts.</p>
<p>Developmental activities are inherent to modifications that provide a new capability to a weapon system. As directed by task/delivery order the contractor shall use a systems engineering approach to accomplish the design, development, integration, test, production and delivery of hardware, software, and firmware that provides new capability to the A-10 weapon system. <br />This procurement is for a Multi-Award 10-year Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity contract, including a 5 year base, and 1, five-year option. It is the 538th ACSG's intent to solicit this requirement through Full and Open. The NAICS for this procurement is code 541330. For this procurement the 538 ACSG Project Team shall evaluate all properly received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-1, "Trade of process". As defined in FAR 15.101-1 <br />a) A tradeoff process is appropriate when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.<br />(b) When using a tradeoff process, the following apply:<br />(1) All evaluation factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract award and their relative importance shall be clearly stated in the solicitation; and<br />(2) The solicitation shall state whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than, approximately equal to, or significantly less important than cost or price.<br />(c) This process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal. The perceived benefits of the higher priced proposal shall merit the additional cost, and the rationale for tradeoffs must be documented in the file in accordance with 15.406.<br />The approximate issue date for this solicitation is 8 July 08. It should be noted that all contractors are required to be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database prior to award.</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 ombudsman (paragraph (c) of the clause reads: Julie Primbs at (801) 777-0768, or email julie.primbs@hill.af.mil questions should be directed in writing to: Andrew Hatch, Contracting Officer, via email andrew.hatch@hill.af.mil , telephone 801-775-2291 or by facsimile (801) 777-6172 or Ron Hilliard, Contracting Specialist, via email ronald.hilliard@hill.af.mil, telephone (801) 777-4164 or by facsimile (801) 777-6172.</p>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of SafeWord Service/Maintenance. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the SafeWord product as a key component of the Departments ONE program. This requirement is for the continuation of service support through July 11, 2009. Last year EML purchased an additional 2500 FOBs (reference 8618-710010) due to the expansion of the ONE program throughout the Department of State. These devices allow two factor authentications to access the ONE system. Currently EML has a total of 12818 FOBs that are being used throughout the Department of State under the OpenNet Everywhere (ONE) program. EML has the responsibility to issue these FOBs throughout the Department (to include foreign and domestic posts).As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments Remote access networking infrastructure.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>Study on the Development of Quality by Design (QbD) and how this can be Applied to the Most Common Parenteral Manufacturing Processes
<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-08-00747a
<RESPDATE>071608

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking full and open competition for vendors to conduct an analytical study on the development of Quality by Design (QbD) Case Studies and Guidance Elements on Parenteral Dosage Forms. <p>

<b>Purpose</B>:  To reach a better understanding of the concept of Quality by Design (QbD) and how this can be applied to the most common parenteral manufacturing processes.  <p>

<b>Background</b>:  Pharmaceutical manufacturing is going through a major transition from quality assessment by testing the product at the end of manufacture to the more holistic control strategy of Quality by Design (QbD) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT).  There is greater realization that an enhanced understanding of the pharmaceutical processes involved in product manufacture and in particular, appreciation of criticality of the process steps and the critical process parameters that control each of these steps are of vital importance to ensuring quality of manufactured products.    With the advent of QbD, each pharmaceutical company is likely to implement science and risk based approaches to evaluate its own processes, determine their critical steps and necessary controls and establish a design space for each process.  It is essential therefore, that companies have a common understanding to make the review process more consistent. <p>

<b>Description of Work</B>: The design for the study is shown in Figure 1 below.   A typical Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) that is widely available and is representative will be picked for this study.  (See attachment)<p>

Figure 1: QbD for Parenterals  The Approach<p>

The study will involve the following steps: <p>

<li>1. Define the Critical Product Attributes of the Target Product Profile.  The target product profile would include: 
a.	Assay
i.	API source and control strategy 

b.	Complete recovery of API activity upon reconstitution
For small molecules, this is generally not a problem.  For large molecules, and particularly for vaccines, it can be an unrealistic goal, and we can only strive for consistent recovery of activity. In cases where the concentration of formulation excipients is very low, or where organic co-solvent systems are used, powder ejection from the vial during freeze drying can be a significant issue

c.	Reconstitution
i.	Influence of formulation components 
ii.	Thermal history of freezing 
iii.	Potential effect of collapse, or micro-collapse, on reconstitution time 

d.	Freedom from extraneous particulate matter
i.	May be related to slow, or incomplete, reconstitution 
Instability of freeze-dried solid can lead to particulate matter in reconstituted solid

e.	Stability
i.	Effect of residual moisture in freeze-dried solid 
Potential for transfer of moisture from stopper to freeze fried solid
ii.	Effect of vial headspace composition
 
<li>2. Propose a formulation using key formulation design decisions. 
<li>3. Propose the manufacturing process. 
<li>4. Conduct a risk analysis using cause and effect process (Ishikawa diagram) to identify the variables that are like to impact the manufacturing process. 
<li>5. Risk Evaluation  classify the unit operations that are likely to have an impact on quality. 
<li>6. Identify the critical operating variables and material property variables that are like to have the maximum impact on the Critical Product Attributes. (Risk evaluation study using Risk = probability X impact and FMEA) 
<li>7. Design of Experiments.
<li>8. Conduct the experiments in laboratory/pilot plant equipment. 
<li>9. Develop Formulation Design Space and Lyophilizer Design Space. 
<li>10. Propose control strategy to reduce risk. <p>

<p><b>Deliverables:</b><p>
<li>1. Monthly teleconferences shall be on the 1st day of the month in the mornings (TBD). 
a.  Shall maintain an on-going dialogue by communicating with the project officer & key study personnel via e-mail or telephone as necessary in order to provide periodic updates of study progress, status, and interim results related to various phases of the study.
<li>2. Quarterly project reports in Word document shall be submitted to the project officer & key study personnel by the first day of the month (Q1 for method development, Q2 for formulation optimization, Q3 for process optimization, Q4 for final report). 
a. Keep and maintain all raw data collected during the performance of the study in laboratory notebooks and/or CDROM.
<li>3. A final report in Word document shall be submitted to the project officer & key study personnel two weeks prior to the end of the 12-month time period of the study.
<li>4. Presentation at the FDA of the final results shall be two weeks after the 12-month time period of the study.
<li>5. Expect 1-day site visit from the project officer and/or key study personnel at vendor site at the 3-month and 9-month time periods of the study.
<li>6. Vendor shall visit FDA facility in Silver Spring, Maryland for seminar presentation in PowerPoint format and/or for face-to-face discussion of the project at the 11-month time period of the study.
<li>7. FDA retains full data rights to all information related to this study, including any subcontract works.  <p>

<SUBJECT>Scientific Program to Support Epidemiologic Investigations of Safety Related Issues of Marketed Drugs, and Evaluations of Risk Management Programs and Tools
<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-08-00766
<RESPDATE>081408
<CONTACT>Patricia Wright, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-827-7217, Fax 301-827-7101, Email patricia.wright@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking proposals for a contractor to fulfill a requirement for a program titled:   Scientific Program to Support Epidemiologic Investigations of Safety Released Issues of Marketed Drugs, and Evaluations of Risk Management Programs and Tools.
 
The primary objectives to be accomplished under these contracts are to provide FDA with: 1) Conduct drug safety analyses of importance to FDA using both retrospective and prospective methods, as appropriate; 2) Establish a collaborative arrangement with existing pharmacoepidemiologic research programs for the purpose of conducting epidemiologic studies of drug safety issues using databases containing electronic health information; 3) Establish a collaborative arrangement with existing pharmacoepidemiologic research programs for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of risk management programs and tools using databases containing electronic health information; 4) Obtain technical assistance or consultative support on methods and the use of electronic healthcare data resources for conducting pharmacoepidemiologic research, and; 5) Enable timely access to US and Canadian population-based data sources to ensure public safety when necessary.  

Data Requirements: Successful Contractors will have continuous access to an updated electronic healthcare data resource containing patient-level health encounter data from the U.S. or Canada.  The data resource shall be a computerized system able to link each patient to all relevant medical care data including enrollment status, drug exposure data, and coded medical outcomes.  This data resource will meet the criteria specified in the minimum mandatory criteria throughout the length of the contract.  Linkage of this data resource to additional information, including vital records, chronic disease and/or cancer registries, and birth defect registries, if available, is also of interest.  It shall be solely the Contractors responsibility to insure that the data are HIPAA-compliant, and to de-identify the data for FDA use. FDA will require no patient-, provider-, or health plan-specific identifiers.  All research performed by the FDA PRP centers must comply with standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information and protect the rights of human subjects in research.

For the purpose of this requirement, the data resource shall be sufficient to meet FDAs need to access patient-level data describing health encounters and prescription drug use by individuals over time.  The data resource shall have longitudinal data that shall be capable of following uniquely identifiable individuals (using encrypted patient identifiers) over time.  Demographic information (e.g. age and gender), health history, diagnoses and procedures, and hospitalizations shall be provided.  Information on race/ethnicity shall be included, if available, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.  The data resource shall also have the ability to identify pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes as well as have the ability to subsequently link maternal and child records after birth.

In addition, for each patient these data shall contain prescription drug and biologic utilization information, including the generic and brand name of the product, strength, dosage form, days supply, all dates dispensed, initial/continuing therapy indicator, quantity dispensed, instructions for use (if available), indication for use (if available) and prescriber specialty.   The resource shall employ the use of a generally accepted, granular coding system for drugs and medical products, as well as for diagnoses and procedures.  In addition, the contractor shall have the ability to determine that the drug or biologic was dispensed to the patient, rather than just prescribed to the patient.

All patient medical diagnostic information shall be represented in the data resource, including diagnoses and procedures associated with all ambulatory, emergency, chronic or acute care setting visits and their dates, diagnoses and procedures associated with all related hospitalizations and their dates, and all laboratory tests and results (if available) and their dates.  Other health measures (such as family health history, height, weight, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol use, blood pressure measurements, etc.), are of interest if available.  The successful Contractors shall have the capability of accessing inpatient medical records for validating coded diagnostic data; access to outpatient medical records is also of interest if available.

The ability to contact a sample of physicians and/or a sample of patients/caregivers on an ad hoc basis for information beyond what is available in the data source (e.g., survey to determine reasons for prescribing decisions, use of informed consent, use of nonprescription drugs and/or medical products, comprehension of consumer medication information) is also of interest.

FDA intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competitive requirement.  

The solicitation will be available for download on or about July 15, 2008 and may be accessed through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.   No hardcopies will be distributed. Any questions concerning this requirement must be submitted in writing by e-mail only, to Patricia Wright at patricia.wright@fda.hhs.gov.  NO PHONES WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>NASA LaRC has a requirement for the development, test and evaluation of the Cloudsand the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) Flight Model 6 (FM6) Instrument for flighton the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) C1Mission. Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, "Only One ResponsibleSource and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements", NASA LaRCintends to purchase the FM6 Instrument from Northrop Grumman Space Technology (NGST)Company as a follow-on acquisition to the CERES Proto-Flight Model (PFM), FM1, FM2, FM3,FM4, and FM5 instruments.  The CERES FM6 Instrument is available only from the originalsource of the highly specialized CERES instrument. Any delays in obtaining the FM6Instrument due to learning curves and lack of facilities by other sources will causeschedule delays resulting in budgetary impacts and potential for jeopardizing missionsuccess.  NGST is the only source with the specialized calibration facilities andexpertise to satisfy the NPOESS C1 cost and schedule constraints.  Inability to meet theNPOESS C1 launch schedule will risk the continuity of accurate weather, climate,hydrological, and space weather forecasts to the civilian and US military communities.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) is a large translational research program with goal design, development and delivery of innovative immunotherapies for various types of human cancers. Many projects involve monitoring patient immune responses pre and post-vaccination in the vaccine clinical trials. An ELISPOT assay for interferon gamma and other cytokines production to evaluate T-cell responses was used using peptides from tumor associated antigens such as CEA, PSA, MUC-1. These assays are also used in the pre-clinical study for many investigators in LTIB. An ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) Reader is required for the measurement of the number, the size, and the intensity of the cytokine producing specific T cells. The current ELISPOT Reader in LTIB is a first generation ELISPOT Reader. This ELISPOT Reader has limited functions and applications. In addition, the current ELISPOT reader gives diffused images and extra effort is required to distinguish the different between dirt from small spots in some samples. An advance model ELISPOT Reader is essential for the precise determination of patient immune responses pre vs. post vaccination.

<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Commnad Southwest intends to award a contract, on a sole source basis, in accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures the aggregate amount of which will not exceed $100,000.00 to Kiva Biological Consulting, Inyokern, California.  The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain technical services to monitor tortoise health  by examining live tortoises and taking and analyzing tortoise blood samples during 2009 with an option to conduct additional assessments in 2010. Work will occur primarily in three training areas; Lavic Lake, Rainbow Canyon and Noble Pass. Monitoring tortoise health in the field will improve the understanding of the general health of Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) Twentynine Palmss tortoises, help document severity of disease threats, and help conserve the species.
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open ompetition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other suplies or services will satisfy the agency's requirements.  This project requires a United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Permit to perform the health assessments, because the desert tortoise is a listed species under the Endangered Species Act of 1972 as amended.  Kiva Biological Consulting has a unique capability that no other contractor can provide at MCAGCC. Kiva personnel are experts in desert tortoise handling methods and health assessments.  Due to their expertise, Kiva personnel are the only contract personnel presently authorized to take blood samples and nasal samples from MCAGCC tortoises under the USFWS research permit.  This permit was just issued this spring and will not be renewed for five years.It is the Government's position that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirement.  The contract duration is approximately 365 days, with option to extend the contract.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 235990   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management, Headquarters, Emergency Response Service Center, Mail Code 3805R, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC  20460 intends to award a sole source order to First Response Robotics, LLClocated in Amelia, Ohio, based on the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-1 for the following services:
The purpose of this order is purchase a one year maintenance agreement with said vendor for the purpose of maintaining the EPA's custom made "HERO" Robot, manufactured also by First Response Robotics, LLC.  First Response Robotics, LLS is the sole designer and manufacturer of the "HERO" robot platform.  All mechanical parts of the robot are unique to its design.  To maintain continuity  of operations, First Response Robotics, LLC is the only provider of such periodic maintenance.  If parts need to be replaced or repaired, First Response Robotics is the only company that could do the work given the unique design of the robot.  If the robot is maintained by another company, the warranty on the robot would be voided and would thus cause an detriment to the government in having to re-warrant parts already under warranty with the vendor.  The maintenance on this robot is to be for one year (12 months) from the date of award.  
This procurement also yields the purchase of an Operator Control Unit (OCU) which includes a video display, battery charging and data transmission system in one case.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Eduardo Morales, Ph.D., Professor, Alliant International University and Clinical and Consulting Psychologist, 3129 Mission Street, #1, San Francisco, CA 94110.

The Youth Scholar and Workforce Development Initiative will address the problem regarding the low Hispanic behavioral health and addiction treatment workforce in the U.S.  Its purpose is threefold: (1) to work with Hispanic high school students and offer them the opportunity to be exposed to information and mentors in the addiction and behavioral health fields to encourage them to become mental health and addiction treatment practitioners; (2) to develop a support system for Latinos through high school and college years to help them complete and secure degrees and subsequently enter into the addiction and behavioral health workforce; and (3) to increase the knowledge in the addiction and mental health fields on strategies and methodologies to treat Hispanic clients who have addiction and mental health problems.

The Contractor is responsible for but not limted to the following Tasks:

Target at least two Hispanic public health conferences (including the Latino Behavioral Health Institute Conference [LBHI]) with high levels of attendance by Hispanic behavioral health and addiction treatment workers and develop a youth scholar initiative at those conferences.  Use the LBHI model and expand the outreach initiative to reach at least four predominantly Hispanic high schools. 

Enlist the participation of at least 100 Hispanic high school students through cooperation with their respective high schools and facilitate attendance to one of the conferences.  Ensure youth participation at the youth scholar initiative as well as other public health, addiction treatment, and mental health workshops.

Match students with mentors who will maintain contact with them throughout the academic year.  Identify, train, and monitor Hispanic youth mentors.  Match mentors with at least 25 students using a one-to-one ratio.

Monitor the progress of the youth programs by observing their entry into behavioral health careers.  Follow up with contacts to monitor progress and ensure youth stay connected to mentors and other support systems available to them.

Create a youth section in the already existing National Latino Addiction Community Network (NLATCN) webpage and develop links from Myspace website for other youth to access the NLATCN website.  Number of hits to the website will be tracked and feedback from website visitors will be solicited.

Conduct workshops and/or presentations on issues related to Hispanic behavioral health and addiction in at least two mainstream major behavioral health and addiction treatment conferences:

Conduct literature searches to identify curricular courses in behavioral health at high school and college levels, related to the need to better serve predominantly Hispanic communities and on methodologies and approaches that best serve the community.

Design power point presentations on various aspects of health among Hispanics.  Draw upon existing information on the web to generate the presentations for classes. Develop bibliographies associated with each topic, such as (1) health factors among immigrants;
(2) substance abuse among Hispanics; (3) Hispanics culture and treatment; (4) Hispanic youth; (5) Hispanic demographics in the U.S. and population trends; and (6) HIV/STD and Hispanics.

<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Office of the Administrator, (OA), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Georgetown University, Center for Child and Human Development
Washington, DC   20030.

This contract supports the development of a Recovery Model for adolescents and transition-age youth with substance abuse and/co-occurring substance abuse and mental health issues.  It  is expected that this model will be informed by multiple sources of data:  empirical data demonstrating effective programs and practices for youth with SA and/or Co-occurring SA and  MH issues; provider experience with effective strategies that result in sustained recovery for youth; youth who have been involved in multiple services systems and their families; and experts in the field of positive youth development.  It will also address the challenges posed to the recovery concept in mental health and the preference for the concept of resiliency.

The Contractor shall be responsible for but not limited to the following:

The key deliverables for this contract will be (1) a consultative session and (2) a concept paper on the Adolescent Recovery System of Services and Supports that serves to further refine a model of the necessary services and supports to promote and sustain adolescent recovery and resiliency.

The consultative session will serve to define and operationalize the concept of adolescent recovery.  It will convene experts who interface with adolescent recovery issues from diverse perspectives.  Services researchers will provide the empirical foundation for understanding what services, programs or practices contribute to or are critical elements in recovery;  providers, including SAMHSA grantees, will delineate the essential care components in recovery; youth and their families will address this question from their experiences in systems and services; and researchers on positive youth development will articulate the necessary conditions for youth, with or without mental health and substance abuse issues, to flourish in their communities.  As adolescents are embedded in their families, schools and communities, the concept will be further refined to capture the systemic as well as individual nature of sustained recovery.  This will also be done for transition-age youth.

The concept paper will propose a model of adolescent and transition youth recovery based on the discussions and materials shared at the Consultative Session.  It will include a discussion of definitions of recovery, a consensus definition provided by the Consultative Session, key principles in recovery-oriented care, barriers and facilitators to recovery, critical factors in sustained recovery, strategies to measure recovery at the individual, family and community level, essential service sectors to include in an array of recovery services, e.g., youth workforce development system of services and supports, and supports that are developmentally appropriate for adolescents and transition age youth, integration of recovery-oriented treatment models with positive youth development models, community integration, and challenges to moving toward recovery-oriented care for youth.  The contractor will be expected to build on reports from previous SAMHSA-convened meetings by CMHS and CSAT on recovery and resiliency in youth, recovery-oriented systems of care and the youth focus groups from the CSAT  national summit on recovery. 

The Georgetown University Center for Child and Human Development is uniquely positioned to perform these tasks because of its critical work in a systems of care approach for youth with mental health and co-occurring mental health and substance use issues.  

The Center is a key national provider of technical assistance and policy development to States for systems of care programs for youth with mental health and co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders and has a one-of-a-kind extensive network of researchers, providers, policymakers and family and youth organizations that can participate in the requested consultative session to develop a recovery and resiliency model of care.  The Center has been the key national provider of technical assistance for state adolescent substance abuse coordinators and state child and youth mental health directors to develop the system of services and supports for youth with mental health and substance abuse problems.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a noncompetitive purchase order using procedures authorized by FAR Subparts 12.6 and 13.5 for eleven (11) each portable Fourier Transform Infrared chemical identification machines, model IdentifyIR, with related computer/peripherals, and on-site assembly, installation, training, and on-site warranty coverage, from Smiths Detection, to be donated for use by the government of Ecuador under the Department's international narcotics and law enforcement program.  

This notice is not a request for competitive quotations; this acquisition will be processed using the authority in FAR 6.302-1.  Justification for other than full and open competition is that the Government requires  portable chemical identification equipment that is easy to use and features software using diamond attenuated total reflection sampling that can be operated easily by non-specialist personnel.  The Narcotics Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador has researched this technology and was unable to find any other companies that have this type of technology.  Although other FT-IR machines exist, most are designed for use in a controlled environment (such as a laboratory); none of them has the portability/rugged and input-output features required by NAS and the Government of Ecuador (such as a connected laptop computer for display of operations and results).  Also, many FT-IR machines are designed to check for gases rather than liquids or solids.  The required equipment must be portable, be able to identify suspect chemicals in seconds, and be able to identify both liquids and solids, including narcotics or precursor chemicals camouflaged in other liquids or material.  Only the IdentifyIR equipment meets these needs.

Solicitation is not available at this time.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to change the acquisition strategy.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources for Whole Body Imager (WBI) systems for screening of passengers to be used in our Nations airports. The TSA will examine each Offerors response to this announcement to determine those vendors who have satisfactorily met the minimum requirements as specified in the white paper requirements section of this announcement. The TSA intends to establish a Qualified Product List (QPL) based on the overall performance of each Offerors WBI against TSA specifications and reasonableness of price.  Only Offerors who respond to this announcement and demonstrate compliance to TSAs requirements, as specified in the TSA WBI Procurement Specification, dated May 2008, will be eligible for placement onto the QPL.  This will be an open QPL, meaning that the Offeror will be able to submit white papers to the contracting officer at any time, although testing will only occur at the discretion of the TSA.  If initial testing finds that the product fails to meet the basic requirements, a vendor will not be permitted to retest sooner than 30 business days after the failure, unless it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  If the product fails a second test, the product will be locked out of future testing for six months, unless the Government determines it is in TSAs best interest to allow further testing.  Only Offerors who successfully complete testing will be placed on the QPL and be considered for a contract award.

Requirements for the WBI system have been broken into four tiers with progressively increasing levels of requirements.  The vendor has the choice to meet the requirements of the different tiers.  To be added to the QPL, each vendor must meet all Tier I requirements.  A higher-level system must meet all the requirements of the tiers below it.  For example, a Tier III system must meet all Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III requirements.  Potential examples of Tier I requirements include Security Technology Interface Program (STIP), privacy filters, and the ability to scan an individual in the 95th percentile for height.  The tier structure primarily reflects progressively increased requirements for performance to potentially include multiplexing and explosives detection. (see attachments for full announcement)

<DESC>The Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L, LCMC)Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for The Rapid Response (R2) Acquisition Thrust. The R2 is the major part of a Command Pilot Program to increase the Armament, Research, Development and Engineering (ARDEC) responsiveness to meeting its customers immediate requirements. In support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT), ARDECs mission, including lethality and counter-lethality efforts has expanded to include providing expedited developmental solutions to meet the customers needs at various stages of the lifecycle of a product. Historically, research and development was allowed years to develop and integrate solutions into weapons systems. Todays reality requires ARDEC to provide working lethality and counter-lethality solutions as quickly as possible. In many instances, solutions need to be provided within weeks from receiving a requirement or no more than one year.
This R2 effort will provide a responsive contracting vehicle to meet these surge and/or specialized requirements. The use of a broad scope Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with multiple prime contractor awards to maintain competition is expected to provide the flexibility and responsiveness required to meet current Army mission requirements.
This competitive acquisition is intended for multiple award contracts as a result of the Request for Proposal (RFP) (W15QKN-08-R-8403). An integrated assessment will be made by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) from the results of the evaluation factors and sub-factors as set forth in Section M. Multiple awards will be made based on the best overall proposals that represent the best value to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the Offerors Technical, Management, Task Order 1 and Delivery Order 1, Past Performance, Small Disadvantaged Business Participation and Price/Cost. Pre-award surveys may be conducted. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest price offeror or to other than the offeror with the highest color rating if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.
After contract award, individual Task/Delivery Orders will be competed amongst the multiple awardees under each respective contract utilizing fair opportunity procedures in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1). The Government will put forth a Letter of Contemplation and the Contractors will have five working days to respond. Proposals will be evaluated using an integrated assessment of schedule, cost and performance. The Government will evaluate the responses over a period of seven working days and then a period of five working days will be used to negotiate between the Government and the contractor (as required) and then award the task (seventeen working days in total is the goal for Task/Delivery Order award).
A non-disclosure agreement will be required to be signed by the offeror(s) receiving an award. The Government intends to award this contract on a best value basis using Full and Open Competition. It is anticipated that the IDIQ will have duration of five years. 
It is anticipated this solicitation will be posted on the US Army JM&L, LCMC Procurement Network website located at http://procnet.pica.army.mil. This is not an RFP; the RFP will be issued on or about July 14, 2008. The deadline for all proposals will be 45 days after issuance of the RFP.
Questions shall be submitted to U.S. Army JM&L, LCMC, Attn: Margaret B. Reed, Contract Specialist, AMSML-AQ-SP, Building 322, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, Email: margaret.b.reed@us.army.mil.

In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Bonnie L. Goetz, (315) 330-2008, Bonnie.Goetz@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).   If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Susan Hunter, Building 15, RM225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 FAX: 937-255-5036 COM: 937-255-7754.

<DESC>Bagram Air Base (BAF), Afghanistan is requesting information from the industry regarding Spray Foam Insulation.  BAF is researching the possibilities of having spray foam insulation applied on buildings and structures throughout the Afghanistan area of operations.  The foam will be applied to buildings and structures built with a variety of construction materials including Fabric (tents), Wood (b-huts), Stone (local construction)/Brick and Mortar and metal (Relocatable Buildings [RLBs] i.e.: modified connex container structures).   There is an estimated 4 million square feet of surface area which will require covering.

The contractor will provide trained staff members, staff supervisors and inspectors from either the local population or from foreign (outside Afghanistan) locations, who possess the knowledge and experience to apply this foam according to the Manufacturers recommended process as clarified by Quality Assurance/Quality Control standards specified in the Statement of Work.

The contractor will be responsible to provide all materials and equipment needed to satisfy the requirement.  This includes, but is not limited to, application equipment, cleanup materials, special work clothing and equipment (coveralls, masks, respirators, gloves, boots, etc) which are required to accomplish this work.  

The contractor will prepare the application surface (eg: wash or power wash the surfaces, strip paint, remove loose paint, prime surfaces as necessary, etc) on each building.  They will apply the Foam Insulation according to the manufacturers recommended application process, and will apply whatever surface finishing is necessary to attain an end product which is waterproof and fire retardant.  When applied, this foam should have insulating properties of R-4 per inch with a total R-rating of R-8 or greater.  The end product should be waterproof, fire retardant, and provide sound insulation to the structure it is applied to.

<DESC>A FULL PDF COPY OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS ATTACHED. 	   

A.	General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Sources Sought regarding potential sources. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with [Industry Best Practices] Drug Product Content Management

B. Objective:

Improvement of quality of FDA drug product data and creation of DESI-FR database.

C. Statement of Work:
Requirements:  Requirements designated as (Primary) are to be developed First.

TASK 1 (Primary)  Manage the Rx Prug Product Content
The purpose of this effort is to contract with a private drug database whose drug product listing(s) includes every drug product on the US market with FDA application products coded or otherwise identified.  The contractor will compare FDA drug product content (accuracy) with that of the contractors private drug product database listings and apply quality control to drug product listing content as appropriate.  While the FDA understands the importance of drug product data bases that include pricing and clinical information, its primary interest is in the universe of application and non-application drug products  and those attributes under a.

a    The contractor shall utilize their proprietary searchable drug product data base to find drug
product information, including:  
(1) NDC #, (2) name of drug tradename (if applic), (3) name of generic or generic tradename, (4) each active ingredient and its strength, inactive ingredient (optional), (5) dosage form, (6) # of units in container and (5) FDA NDA or ANDA # The product must be updated daily. The contractor database must also include Rx biological drug products.  

b.   The contractor will grant FDA a license to use the contractors database under the terms of this contract and the licensing agreement. 

c.   The contractor will compare each business day the drug product content of their database [minimum of 98% accuracy of all drug products on the market] with the drug products FDA has listed in its system and be able to determine (1) the portion of the universe of drug products on the marketplace that are listed with FDA to date, and (2) to determine the accuracy of the drug products listed in FDAs listing system, (as determined by drug product data elements in Task 1 (a) and (3)) and be able to identify all drug products that have not been listed in FDAs listing system by establishments and which drug products may be inactive or removed from the market 
and should be coded obsolete in FDAs listing system (to indicate the product is no longer available on the market). Drug products are never removed from FDA drug product listing system having regulatory implications.  They will be coded to reflect their status as active, inactive or no longer on the market.

d.    The contractor drug product database must include all Rx human drug products on the US market within 98% accuracy.  An appropriate drug product surveillance and collection method must be in place that continually and consistently interacts with manufacturers and/or distributors of Rx drug products to insure their drug product database is complete, comprehensive, timely and correct.  The contractor must have a system of coding that allows differentiation of which drugs are application drug products (NDAs, ANDAs) and which are not (no NDA, ANDA).  
	
e.	  FDA regulates all drug products in the US marketplace including OTC drug products.  The contractors drug product database must capture at least 70% all OTC human drug products on the US market.  An appropriate method must be in place to collect information on OTCs to meet this requirements.  Also, requirements in (a) apply. 

f.     The contractors drug product database must differentiate between Rx products and OTC human drug products as required in (a). In addition, the contractors database must be able to differentiate between a drug product and a non-drug product as defined by FDA. This is important because industry has been prolific in the assignment of NDC #s to drug and non-drug products.  It is important to understand this because in the electronic drug product listing system, an establishment must choose a regulatory status for each drug product.  Although the establishment may have assigned an NDC# to a non-drug, the establishment will be unable to list a non-drug and will be confronted with this the first time an attempt is made to list or relist the non-drug under the electronic system. 
There is no category in the FDA listing system for a non-drug (device, nutritional supplement, etc.).



TASK 2 (Primary) Perform Quality Control and Other Reviews

Drug product data that is entered into FDA electronic drug listing system by the listing establishment will be reviewed by the contractor and errors identified for subsequent correction. The contractor will review NDC#s - any irregular NDC # must be noted for subsequent correction.  All changes will be brought to the attention of the listing establishment for reconciliation using the email address provided by the establishment for that location in FDAs registration data base. The contractor will review each drug products label content and format, which must conform to FDA requirements, and finally, the contractor must insure that establishments assign each drug product a regulatory status (NDA, ANDA, medical gas, API, etc).  If the establishment does not know the status, or the products status is not one on the primary list, the establishment will choose Other.  When Other is selected, the reviewer will select a regulatory status code using the database described in Task 3 and code the status.   The FDA will provide the necessary training and orientation for the processes under Task 2.  In situations where an error or inconsistent is detected, the contractor cannot correct 

the error.  The communication method to be used to notify an establishment of a listing or other error will be using the email address on record to send an email to the establishment.

a.	The contractor will check to insure that NDC #s are assigned to human drug products only.  Food supplements and devices, if not in a combination kit with a drug, will not receive NDC #s. The FDA has the right to withhold any NDC# if the NDC # which the establishment previously assigned to its drug product is irregular, not a drug, or the establishment is not within compliance.  

b.	The contractor shall review drug product data that is entered into the
electronic system by the establishment and identify any errors or irregularities for subsequent correction.  The contractor will use their proprietary drug database to assist in locating listing errors by comparing with listed drug information entered by the establishment.  Over a period of time in which data review may have noted a pattern of data entry errors in certain fields, it may be possible to limit the review to those certain fields. 

c.	The contractor shall notify the establishment by email of each discrepancy
found.and will request that more information be provided if necessary.

d.	Establishments must justify each drug product for being on the market.  Validation categories include but are not limited to: NDA, ANDA, Medical Gas, IND, API, etc. When an establishment checks Other as a drug product regulatory category, the contractor must review the drug product, and find the correct compliance code to manually enter.  To facilitate the review of drug products in Other, Task 3 of this RFP requires the contractor to develop a database so that FDA can  cross-index NDC#s to Product Names to Compliance Codes and Federal Register # and dates.  Compliance codes are used to designate a drug products regulatory status (justification for being on the market), although in the future these drug products could become the target of an Unapproved Drug CPG (June 19, 2006) .  No drug product will be listed unless a category is assigned showing a reason for the product being on the market. FDA will provide the necessary training for validation review.

e.	The contractor will review validation categories selected by the establishment for a drug product in FDAs drug product listing system, and will manually assign validation codes when the establishment has selected Other, as in (d)

f.	The contractor will be able to connect by telephone or email with an FDA expert on regulatory status and compliance codes.  This person will serve in an advisory role to the contractor on validation and other issues.  In addition, the specifications for building a database that will facilitate compliance code assignments when Other is selected by the establishment for a drug product are included in Task 3.

Scope of Work: Drug Listing Content Management 
The FDA Describes the following primary and secondary Tasks to be delivered by the contractor.
Primary tasks have the highest primary and will be funded first.

a. TASK 1 (Primary)

Manage the Rx drug product content of FDAs drug listing system
Note: Current system is DRLS (Drug registration and Listing System);  An electronic registration and listing platform will replace/supplement DRLS by early 2009:
	Map vendor Rx drug product File to FDA Rx drug File to identify and reconcile

TASK 5 (Secondary) Handling of Forms 2657; Data Entry of Data from Form 2657
	Although paper products will officially no longer be accepted for drug registration 
and listing after electronic registration and listing system is made available to industry, companies can request a waiver to continue using the forms.  FDA anticipates the number of companies requesting this waiver will be very few.  However, if and when paper forms arrive at FDAs White Oak Center, they may be forwarded to the contractor for manual entry into the electronic drug product listing platform.  If and when this task is activated, proper instruction will be provided to the contractor.
The contractor shall open mail, enter data, and file forms 2657 if it becomes
necessary to respond to a waiver request for continued use of the paper forms.

Perform data entry of data into Listing platform from data received from establishments on Form 2657, Drug Listing.  Forms will be received at FDA White Oak and sent by carrier to vendor operating address.  
Note: FDA is developing electronic registration and listing platforms in order to eliminate the above paper forms and therefore eliminate data entry requirements.  There may be a residual amount of forms that continue to be received but we anticipate the use of forms to dwindle precipitously over the next 6 months to 1 year.

C. Project Background:
Background  Drug Product Content Management

  	The FDA needs drug data content management support because it has neither the expertise or the skills to 
  	maintain content at the optimal accuracy, comprehensiveness, and timeliness to support its needs. 
                          The FDA currently does not have access to thousands of unlisted products on the market, so it cannot
                          confront establishments regarding the drugs they do not list. 
          Thousands of commercial [drug content] manager clients and customers, including government 
  	   drug programs, have access to complete drug product content.  However, FDAs current drug registration 
          and listing system, DRLS, is incomplete and inaccurate.  

The FDA will soon replace DRLS, which requires establishments to submit paper forms 2656 and 2657 to register and list (R&L).  A system that will allow establishments to R&L directly by electronic transaction should be in place soon.  Final details on system platform and industry access are still being worked out.  

This contract will primarily be a service contract supporting FDAs electronic drug listing.  We can only provide limited information on what support may be necessary as we transition from dependence on the paper forms to an electronic R&L platform.  An update will be provided once more is known. With certainty, a quality review of drug product listed data in order to insure it is accurate and up-to-date, will be a primary function of this contract.  Familiarity with drugs and drug products will be required, with very minimum data entry involved.   A review of labeling and assignment of a compliance code that justifies a drug product being on the market, will be required for all non-application drugs.

The contract also requires technical services that involves developing a DESI-Federal Register Database.  The FDA will use the universe of drug products in the vendors drug data file to code each Rx non-application drug initially, then only as new non-application drugs are added as the vendor drug data files are updated. FDA will enter these coded drug products into the DESI-Federal Register Database along with the Federal Register # and Date that authorizes them.  Using this database, vendor reviewers can easily assign codes to each non-application drug listed in the FDAs electronic listing platform.  More detail can be found within the content of this Statement of Work.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires establishments to register and list their drugs (21 CFR 207).  The Drug  Registration and Listing System (DRLS) serves as the repository of registered drug establishments and their listed drug products.  21 CFR 207 instructs industry to use Forms 2656 and 2657 to register and list, and considers unlisted drugs to be misbranded.  Non-compliant firms may be subject to criminal or regulatory action.  

But years of industry non-compliance have taken their toll.  The Health and Human Services Office of the 

Inspector General found numerous discrepancies in DRLS content as compared to that of a private industry drug product database.  Over 36% of DRLS drug product listings were no longer on the market.  Many drug products on the market were not listed in DRLS.  OIG concluded that FDA should routinely compare their drug product list with a commercial database to identify drugs that have not been listed and drugs which have been taken off the market.  Today, leadership among  this group of private drug product databases boast quality [accuracy and completeness] at the six sigma level1. These are industrys best practices group.

Early next year (2009), the FDA proposes to phase out the paper Forms 2656 and 2657. Establishments must use an electronic interface to register and list their drugs.  Establishment must register under the new electronic system and relist all of their drug products. But as the IG suggested, FDA neither has the expertise or the staff to manage accurate drug product content.  We seek to contract this and other services to a private drug database firm to insure FDA knows which drug products on the market have not been listed, and to provide its expertise, experience and professional resources to provide quality control for drug product content, labeling review, and other services to monitor compliance with FDA requirements.  

 Drug Registration and Listing is critical for an number of FDA and other Government Programs:
a	locations for foreign & domestic establishments and ingredient information on all drugs 
b.	information for initial establishment inspections (Sec 704)
c.	products affiliated with sites used in Risk Models guiding selection of GMP and ADE inspections
d.	information on drug products identical, related, or similar to DESI and NDA/ANDA drugs
e.	information that may be useful in identifying counterfeit, stolen, or diverted drugs.
f.	a searchable data base to accomplish establish and drug research.
g.	a means by which to code unlisted drug products identified through external sources
     	DRLS is also used for/by:
h	Imports  In daily use at the Port authority, officials use the DRLS to verify drug listings.
i.	Imports  In daily use at the Port Authority, officials use the DRLS database Import Query portal to determine if the foreign-made product is listed and has a [legitimate] NDC number (21 CFR 207.40 (b).  Includes finished dose products, APIs, investigational drugs, homeopathics, OTCs, and veterinarian products.
j      Centers for Medicaid/Medicare Services (CMS)  These government drug programs refer to DRLS and are the most adversely affected by inaccurate content and on an almost daily base and through the expertise/consultation of DRLS data base management services as an advisory, acquire information essential to enforcing their drug reimbursement policies .  The Office of Compliance and other FDA activities depend on the DRLS database for high profile programs that depend on data base extractions and reports are the Risk Management Survey Samples, DQRS, ADE inspections, and the Unapproved Universe Problem Solving Working Group.

k     DEA  Refers to the DRLS as an adjunct to other policy guidance to determine which drugs  are controlled substances and how they are classified (schedule assignment)
Note: With no professional oversight for label review at DRLS, we rely on the manufacturers determination regarding controlled substances designation.
l.     NIH  Utilizes DRLS for research purpose.  Have recently requested additional 
information on all drug history including OTCs and homeopathic
m.	VA and DoD Tricare Drug Programs  Recent focus on unapproved drugs has resulted
	in interest from other government agencies with formulary programs who will refer to the DRLS in the future to assist in determining candidate drug products that qualify for formulary inclusion.
n.	Commercial drug database vendors frequently update their own databases by down- loading FDA approved drugs from the NDC Directory. 
o.	Standard-Making Organizations  National Provider Organizations (NPOs) such as 
NCPDP download from the NDC Directory to gather data to support national standard initiatives (HIPAA, Drug Protocols for Reimbursement)
p.	Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, Distributors (Wholesalers, etc), pharmacies and pharmacy chains download NDC Directory data for various purposes to verify drug listing info and to gain advantage in the marketplace.
q.	Import Agents and Mediators  access DRLS data base to verify drug listing data


Background - DESI Related Federal Register Notices Database


This contractor must satisfy this database requirement first in order to accomplish Task 2, particularly the validation of listed non-application drug products that will be checked Other under the Drug Product Category entry.

To more efficiently enforce FDA regulations concerning unapproved drugs, staff need access to an electronic database that supports linkage between marketed drug products and any DESI related Federal Register notice, NDA#, NDC#, and active ingredients associated with such products.

The Federal Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, first brought drug regulation under federal law.  It prohibited the sale of adulterated or misbranded drugs, but did not require that drugs be approved by the FDA.  The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (Act) of 1938 required the review and approval of new drugs for safety before marketing.  Between 1938 and 1962, if a drug obtained approval, the FDA considered drugs that were identical, related, or similar (IRS) to the approved drug to be covered by that approval, and allowed those IRS drugs to be marketed without independent approval.  In 1962 amendments to the Act added efficacy to the safety requirement.  

As part of the 1962 Act, Congress mandated that the FDA conduct a retrospective efficacy evaluation of drug products that the FDA had approved as safe between 1938 and 1962.  This process was called the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) review. All initial DESI determinations are published in the Federal Register (FR).  If the FDAs final determination classifies a drug as being ineffective, the product and all products IRS to it are no longer permitted to be marketed and are subject to enforcement action.  Even if the FDAs final determination classifies the drug as effective for its labeled indications, the FDA still requires approved applications for the continued marketing of the drug and all drugs IRS to it.  It is the Agencys longstanding policy that products subject to an ongoing DESI proceeding may remain on the market during the pendency of the proceeding.

With all the new and changing products on the market, as well as the increasingly global marketplace, it has become increasingly difficult for the FDA to identify and act on all the unapproved products presently marketed.  The Center for Drug Evaluation and Researchs (CDER) Office of Compliance (OC) needs a system that brings together all the elements needed to easily identify the DESI status of drugs, their approval status, and supporting documentation relevant to these drugs in DESI related Federal Register notices.

A. General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Sources Sought regarding potential sources. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with Drug Registration and Listing System.

B. Objective:

Continue data entry and other functions associated with DRLS.

C. Statement of Work:

FUTURE OF DRLS: 
The future of DRLS is with electronic registration and drug listing which will require industry to register and list their products electronically via a FDA website.  The electronic registration system is Drug Facility Registration Module (DFRM); and drug product listing, eLIST.  The systems are at different stages of development  DFRM piloting was completed in December 2007 and is expected to be available industry-wide on a volunteer basis in mid-February 2008.  eLIST is currently under alpha-beta testing and is not expected to be piloted until March or April 2008.  Availability of eLIST to industry on a volunteer basis is expected late fall 2008.  As outlined in the 2008 FDA appropriation language, FDA may make the systems mandatory even before 21 CFR 207 becomes law, although that may be risky without the ancillary CFR provisions kicking in.  However, Critical Path is attempting to call for mandatory DFRM use by December 31, 2008 and eLIST by late spring, 2009, thus affecting, then reducing dramatically, the use of forms over 2009 (depends on when we refuse to receive them).
We remain supportive, but at the same time practical and reasonable in our planning.


SCHEDULE AND TRANSITION IMPACTS:
Parallel with the transition to the electronic systems as described above, the FDA seeks the support of a best practices commercial drug product vendor to help transform DRLS from a fragmented to a complete and reliable product.  Stakeholders increasingly desire information that represents the entire universe of drug products.  DRLS either in its present or electronic versions, must depend on industry to register and list its drug products, and recertify annually.  Industry often shrugs off that responsibility even though mandated by law because of lack of enforcement prerogative.  DRLS and its public counterpart, the NDC Directory, will remain fragmented and unreliable as a complete data source in the foreseeable future. It is our desire to compete this requirement among the best practice community in order to obtain a contractor to manage, and thus dramatically improve, the DRLS data base of the future.

To plan for and accommodate the transition to the electronic systems, DRLS will require uninterrupted contractual support to accomplish data entry and other functions as stated in the attached SOW.  However, the need for that support will ramp down over time as the work shifts to industry as described above.  That kind of flexibility in the contract is necessary due to the fact that the rate at which the work transitions cannot be fully estimated at this time.  The support required is expected to be quite different in July 2009 than in August 2008.  However, some minimal support even after the electronic systems are fully implemented, will be required.

TASK 1 of 2	
1.	Registration Processing
(Form FDA 2656, Registration of Drug Establishment/Labeler Code Assignment or alternate method.
  Requires data entry of information from 1 to 30 possible data entry fields, depending upon submission type as listed below :) 
	Data Entry from new form submissions, Domestic and Foreign.
	Data Entry from update form submissions, Domestic and Foreign.
	Data Entry from annual registration submissions, Domestic and Foreign.
	Data Entry and Filing of correspondence designating foreign firms U.S. Agent.
	Data Entry from other correspondence received from firms, Domestic and Foreign.
	Data Entry from other correspondence received from within FDA.
	Identifying and addressing form deficiencies (this may include handling/processing of
	   calls to/from firms; handling/processing e-mails to/from forms. 
	Mailing out, and following up on Deficiency Letters to/from firms.
	Current number of annual registration form submissions approximate 10,000.  This volume
	   will decrease as establishments voluntarily and then mandatorily enter their own data.
	Continue the transition to DFRM registration with eventually goal of voluntary self-
	    registration by establishments.

2.	Drug Product Listing Processing

Prescription Drug Products  
	(Forms FDA 2657), Drug Product  Listing, and FDA 2658, Registered Establishments Report of Private Label Distributor or alternate method.
	Requires data entry of information from 1 to 35 possible data fields depending upon
            submission type, as listed below:
	Data Entry from new drug form submissions, Domestic and Foreign.
	Data Entry from updated drug form submissions, Domestic and Foreign.
	    Data Entry from other sources reporting drug product information, Domestic and Foreign.

      Over the Counter Drug Products 
	(Forms FDA 2657), Drug Product  Listing, and FDA 2658, Registered Establishments Report of Private Label Distributor or alternate method.
	Requires data entry of information from 1 to 35 possible data fields depending upon
            submission type, as listed below:
	Only Foreign forms for Over the Counter Drugs products will be processed. 

3.	Administrative Support for DRLS
	Receipt of, date stamping, opening and sorting of mail containing incoming drug registration and
      listing forms and other correspondence (approximately 60,000 annually) is required.  This
      volume will decrease as establishments voluntarily and then mandatorily enter their own data.
	Filing of and retrieving DRLS forms upon completion of processing.
	Minimal telephone coverage to receive and place calls to firms in the database as necessary.  A government-implemented automated phone system will provide information to callers or direct 
them to an appropriate source of information.  This should significantly reduce the demands placed on the staff to handle repetitive and redundant information.  
	Phones will be checked & messages retrieved at least 3 times daily and responded to within 48 hours. Electronic registration (Drug Facility Registration Module) is expected to replace the paper form by the end of 2008.
	Mail must be opened daily and disseminated.

4.  	Quality monitoring
	The government will have in place a system to monitor quality and ensure accuracy of the data entry and data management process, to the extent possible.
	The contractor shall monitor the workload of the contractor staff to insure timely accomplishment of tasks.

or security issues say a lot about how supportive the electronic systems will be in helping to foment a partnership between FDA and industry in advancing the public health.  

1.    Verification of Industry-entered Drug Product Listing Data
Using an electronic batch-review process, examine industry-entered data in order to:
	Establish reasonable credibility of firm and drug products entered
	Review correctness, currency, and completeness of data entered 
	Examine compliance to published guidance
	Overview reliability and effectiveness of system and system format
	Test search and query capabilities of system and perform quality reviews as necessary
	Identify trends or patterns (1 record or among several or all records)
	Access free text and comments

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare SystemsCenter New Orleans(SPAWARSYSCENNOLA) is seekingpotential sources  for a futuresolicitation for cost estimatingservices.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA istransitioning to a Navy Working CapitalFund (NWCF) organization affording itthe opportunity to grow its base ofreimbursable work for Navy, DOD,Department of Veterans Affairs andother customers.  As a result, it isanticipated that new opportunities willmaterialize on an increasing basis thatwill require SPAWARSYSCENNOLA toproduce timely and accurateInformation Technology (IT) life cyclecost estimates for hardware andsoftware for potential new customers.Complete and accurate cost and riskinformation is the core of a programscredibility.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA isseeking to improve its capability anddevelop improved processes fortimely and accurate cost estimates forcomplex IT programs and initiatives.It is necessary to establish a formal,consistent and repeatable process forestimating IT costs and improve theconsistency of cost estimations withinthe organization, the accuracy of costestimations and assumptions andreduce the cycle time and effort forcost estimating. A well-designed,systematic approach that effectivelyreflects the cost-related elements of agiven project and documents theassumptions utilized for determiningtrue life cycle costs will increaseapproval rates and the likelihood ofrealizing measurable business benefitsfor a project.  Accurate cost estimationbrings many benefits to anorganization and provides decisionmakers with the information needed tomake sound choices, enable thedevelopment of effective chargeback,forms a critical component of thebusiness case for a project  andcreates a baseline for measuring aprojects success at a future date.Projects will vary in complexity andlength, but experience in costestimating of complex IT developmentprojects and IT migration projects willbe a must. The attached draftstatement of work providesSPAWARSYSCENNOLAs current specificrequirements.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLAanticipates the award of a costreimburseableIDIQ contract withprovisions for fixed priced task orders.The contract will have a base year andfour options.  Release of the formalsolicitation is anticipated in late fourthquarter 2008.  As the requirement isfor truly independent cost estimatingservices, potential offerors should befree of any potential organizationalconflict of interests.  Interestedofferors should provide a letter showinginterests and a brief description of theircapabilities to Ed Wallace, ated.wallace1@navy.mil within 15 days ofthis announcement.

<DESC>The Joint Munitions Center, Life Cycle Management Command and The Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition System are seeking sources for 9mm Marking Cartridges for use in the Close Combat Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK). The CCMCK is a user installed temporary weapon conversion system that allows the Soldier to employ an individual weapon (M9 and M11) at short range using low velocity marking ammunition while precluding the weapon from firing standard service ammunition.  The marking ammunition shall be a reduced-energy, non-lethal cartridge that leaves a bright, water-soluble color marking compound on target upon impact. The visible impact left by the marking compound allows for an accurate assessment of simulated lethality and shot placement.
The ammunition must be compatible with the current US Army qualified CCMCK weapon conversion system.  No additional weapon conversions or modifications outside of the current CCMCK system will be allowed.  A draft purchase description will be available around 14 July 2008.  Interested sources without a previously verified design will be responsible for verifying their cartridge design in accordance with the Government purchase description at their own expense.  In order to be eligible for award, all verification efforts shall be complete and results approved by the government prior to the close of any solicitation.
Sources interested in supplying the marking ammunition should adequately describe their experience in small caliber production and testing, demonstrated high rate production, annual production capacity, and verification status of their proposed design. Those sources not having a previously verified design should also submit a rough outline of their plans and schedule to verify their design and shall submit any backup data to support claims that their design will conform to the purchase description requirements. Sources shall provide verification status of the marking ammunition cartridges that will be supplied under this contract. Contracting Information - The anticipated period of performance shall be from FY09-FY13 and utilize an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for five (5) years.
For Further Information - All interested parties should submit a description of their capabilities along with sketches, drawings, specifications, brochures, current estimated unit cost per million, monthly production capability, and/or test results within 30 days of this notice to: US Army JM&L LCMC, AMSML-AQ-MA, David Gordon, Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000 or by email to: david.gordon5@us.army.mil.  This is a market survey, not a pre-solicitation notice. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part any private sector input as a result of this market survey. See Numbered Notes 25 and 26.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) Sources Sought (SS) for Low Profile, Multi Band, Multi Beam K/Ka/Q Antenna System<BR><BR>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<BR><BR><BR>Background / Objective: <BR>The Government (US Army CERDEC) is interested in receiving information for the design development, delivery and demonstration of an affordable, low-profile On-the-Move (OTM) satellite communications directional antenna system that is capable of operating in K, Ka and Q frequency bands.  This antenna system is needed to support high data rate satellite communications.  This antenna system should be capable of transmitting and receiving via the Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) utilizing its K/Ka frequency band and via the Advanced EHF Satellite (AEHF) and future satellites such as Transformational Satellite (TSAT) utilizing K receive and Q-Band transmit.  The K Band receive array shall support two simultaneous individually pointed beams, one RHCP or LHCP and one LHCP only.  The Ka Band transmit array shall support a single individually pointed RHCP or LHCP beam.  The Q Band transmit array shall support a single individually pointed RHCP or LHCP beam.  Operation at Ka and Q bands is not simultaneous.<BR><BR>The Government plans to start development of this low profile, tri band (K/Ka/Q) antenna system in FY09, with an OTM demonstration on government furnished Army representative vehicles in FY12 to validate a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 6.  Key areas of interest for this antenna system include technology maturity, cost, cross-country tracking performance, RF performance and antenna profile/size.  Critical to the antenna system is the integral cooling system, which must fit within the antenna system profile, and the ability to point and maintain the antenna pointing toward the satellite while on the move.<BR><BR>Informational responses should include a compliance matrix with an explanation of the reasons for any non compliance.  Link budgets should also be included for both clear sky and rain conditions for peer to peer communications through the applicable satellites.  This information will be utilized by the Government to assist in the tailoring of any future specifications.<BR>Discussion: Desired characteristics of the SOTM antennas include, but should not be limited to:<BR>1.	Provides maximum gain with minimal size, weight, and power<BR>2.	Size, Weight, Power Consumption and Design to Unit Production Cost are most important.  Compromises to performance required to meet the above shall be individually discussed in detail.<BR>3.	The integral cooling system shall be discussed in detail.

The following is a projected number of operational USCG HC-144A aircraft for the next five-year period: 
Fiscal Year:	2009	2010	2011	2012	2013
Number of Acft.	5	7	12	14	16
	                          
The HC-144 aircraft will carry a 2000 lb mission systems pallet (MSP).  The MSP is a pallet mounted electronics console which is integrated with aircraft mounted sensors, allowing aircrew members to operate the sensors during flight.  This pallet can be on-loaded and off-loaded from the aircraft in the same manner as general palletized cargo via the aircrafts floor mounted roller system and aft cargo ramp and door.  On-loading and off-loading is currently accomplished by using a forklift.  MSP pallet dimensions are 108.5 x 62.5.   The height of the HC-144A cargo ramp, in the open horizontal loading position is approximately 43 inches from the ground.  Ramp height can vary +/- 5 inches depending on aircraft fuel & cargo load.   

SYNOPSIS:
The USCG is seeking information from potential sources that can provide a pallet cart for ground transport, on-loading, and off-loading of the MSP to/from the HC-144A.  This equipment would be used in lieu of a forklift.  This pallet cart would contain a roller platform, sized to accommodate nothing larger or heavier than the MSP, would incorporate a hand operated scissors lift platform to enable ground handlers to raise the MSP to the level of the aircrafts cargo ramp for loading and unloading operations, and lowered for ground transport.  This pallet cart would transport the MSP to and from the aircraft under tow, using a small or medium sized aircraft tug.      

REPLIES:
All interested parties should respond in writing to CWO Kevin S. Barrick, HC-144A Engineering, c/o Commanding Officer, USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, phone: 252-334-5153, FAX: 252-384-7309, e-mail address (Kevin.S.Barrick@uscg.mil).

The purpose of Expo 2008 is to provide industry an opportunity to present their perspectives on advancing airborne network technology and to facilitate discussions among academia, industry and government (military and civilian).  Due to space restrictions, Expo 2008 is limited to standard Poster Boards and/or PowerPoint/PC Demo presentations.  You may select one or any combination of the two methods.  Each method of presentation MUST relate to advancing airborne network technology.  Expo 2008 is being held at the Radisson Conference Center and space is limited so only two per company site will be allowed.  Also because of the limited space, selection will be on a first received basis.  

Additional Review Days details, registration and Expo information are available at: http://www.afceaeriecanal.org/ant/.

Unfortunately, we request that organizational participation at the Review Days be limited to a maximum of two (2) individuals per organizational location as the total attendance will be limited to 300 persons.  Attendees must be US Citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens. Proof of status is required for registration. Clearances are not required and all discussions will be unclassified. Note: this is NOT a "bidder's conference" and this announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind. The Government will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by an offeror for presentations, marketing efforts or data offered for examination; therefore the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government. 

Registration is available now through http://www.afceaeriecanal.org/ant/.

The Registration Fees are as follows: Early Bird (received by COB 26 July) - $425; 27 July to 2 August - $525; at the door - $625.

Inaddition, participants will have the opportunity to interact directly withsenior executives, project managers, and procurement personnel working forDOEand its prime contractors; and, gain insight into Nuclear Quality Assuranceprogram requirements applicable to both the DOE and commercial nuclearindustrysectors.The purpose of this forum is two fold.  First, it will help ensure that allEMand NNSA sites have an adequate number of qualified nuclear and non-nuclearsuppliers for future projects and programs.  Second, it will provideinformation for suppliers regarding the needs of DOE projects and programsfortheir products and services in the years ahead.  By providing products andservices to DOE for its nuclear projects, companies may become qualified tosupply similar products and services to the commercial nuclear powerindustryas the commercial nuclear renaissance in the U.S. and overseas evolves.Who should attend?Suppliers who wish to provide their products and services to DOE for itsprojects and programs for both nuclear and non-nuclear applications.Services,for example, would include safety analysis, engineering, design, andconstruction.  Examples of products include engineered items, piping,valves,pumps, heat exchangers, cables, electrical components, and duct work.Executives and business development, sales, and marketing professional willfind the forum very informative and support potential expansion of theirbusinesses into the DOE and commercial nuclear markets.RegistrationThere is no registration fee for the conference but you must register.Register at: http://www.prc8a.com/doenuclearsuppliersoutreachmeeting/

<DESC>The Forest Service will soon be soliciting the McLear Thinning Stewardship Project located in Allegany County, VA approximately 5 miles west of Covington, VA along  Route 600.  This project includes thinning of approximately 61 acres of a 40 year old stand and involves a combination of timber and service work items associated with the stewardship project.  The resultant contract will be considered a timber contract with imbedded service work.  Timber to be cut within the project area includes an estimated 670 CCF of non-sawtimber products designated for cutting.  In addition, there is within the contract area an estimated volume of 400 to 600 tons of traditionally non-merchantable woody biomass that the contractor agrees to remove at a fixed rate.  Five stewardship service work items are included in the project.  Mandatory service work items include: 1) disking, liming, fertilization, seeding, and mulching of approximately 5 acres to create wildlife openings and/or linear strips and 2) the removal of the woody material from 4 inches to 2 inches in diameter on the merchantable trees designated for cutting (approximately 400 tons).  Optional service work items include: 3) cutting and removal of understory and midstory stems from 2 inches to 4 inches in diameter at breast height (approximately 600 tons), 4) planting 20 stems of hard and/or soft mast species in the wildlife openings, and 5) construction of an earthen berm to block vehicular access to the harvested unit.  Proposals will be evaluated on a best value basis and offerors must submit a technical proposal describing how harvesting and service work will be completed, as well as, a total value for the timber and the per unit rate for completing each service work item.  The Forest Service expects to solicit this stewardship contracting project by July 11, 2008.  If you have questions or would like to receive a copy of the solicitation package, please contact Russ MacFarlane or Gene McGregor at the George Washington and Jefferson National Forest, 5162 Valleypointe Pkwy, Roanoke, VA  24019, phone (540) 265-5100.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number RFQ-027-4384-08 is issued as a request for quotations and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 2005-24.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516.   For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business size standard is 500 employees. USDA ARS has a requirement for a hyperspectral camera system. Critical characteristics include a visible-near infrared system (400-1000nm), with 1 nanometer bandwidth resolution or better. Unit must be small enough to use on a benchtop.  The system needs to use a high resolution (1 to 2-megapixel) CCD based camera system, with a high dynamic range (12-14 bit).  The imaging system must accept standard C-mount front lenses, be able to mount to a microscope, and be able to correct for smiley and keystone aberrations to sub nanometer error.  The imaging system must include image capture and preprocessing software, and produce hypercubes that can be read by standard hyperspectral image analysis software packages, such as ENVI, IMAGINE, or EM Mapper.  Additionally, due to the work that will be done outside, the system needs to include its own motion, where the camera (or focal plane) moves, while the object doesn't.  To further continuity of research in the exchange of data and images with researchers at another ARS location, the proposed system must be compatible with a Lextel system currently in use.  Two copies of descriptive literature showing that the offered equipment meets all specifications must accompany the quotation.  Delivery time is 30 days ARO.  Equipment price should be FOB Ft Pierce, FL.  Quoted price should include delivery costs.  The government anticipates award of a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the specifications will be most advantageous to the Government.  PAYMENT: Any award made under this solicitation is subject to 31 CFR Part 208 which requires all payments made by the government to be made by electronic funds transfer. Please note on your proposal if you will accept a government purchase (VISA) card.  This solicitation incorporates the following FAR clauses, provisions and addendums:  52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration; 52-212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Item; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. In paragraph B of 52.212-5, the following apply: 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set Aside and 52.225.13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, in Boqueron, PR, is in need of services to collect available information on the characteristics of areas containing essential fish habitat with an emphasis on marine protected areas around Puerto Rico. Information will include benthic habitat and impacts of non-fishing activities on these areas. The information obtained will help in characterizing and selecting habitats for future monitoring of impacts of non-fishing activities and developing management recommendations for conservation of important marine habitats. The project will result in a compilation of historical information on the status of marine resources for areas identified as priorities for conservation by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER). This project addresses some of the needs identified in the Local Action Strategy Overfishing Group priority project, "Select, characterize and monitor those habitats essential for fishery resources that are being affected by non-fishing activities." This project is being initiated as part of the Southeast Regional Office's participation in the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP). This project is also being initiated as a component of NOAA Fisheries' efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089. The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to "preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and marine environment." In order to meet the objective of this work assignment, the contractor shall complete the work in two distinct phases: the compilation of historical information for priority areas, including reports in hard copy and geographic data in electronic form; and final report detailing the methods used to collect the information, sources of information, and presenting tables with information on habitats in the areas, changes over time, and geographic references. Short-term results will consist of the production of a detailed report with qualitative information on changes to important marine habitat areas over time. Long-term results will consist of the identification of those systems and the activities that should be considered for monitoring and the implementation of management to protect marine resources. The project operation must be conducted in order to carry out the technical tasks within the established timeframe. It is the contractor's responsibility to report any problems or complications that may arise during the realization of each task that could affect the timetable. The period of performance is from date of award through 12 consecutive months thereafter. Information regarding NOAA's CRCP, the Coral Reef Task Force, and Local Action Strategies can be found on the internet at http://www.coralreef.noaa.gov. A copy of Executive Order #13089 can be viewed at http://www.coralreef.gov/taskforce/pdf/executive_order13089.pdf.<br />Interested parties can request a copy of the Request for Quotation. This is a small business set-aside. The NAICS code for this action is 541990. Small business size standard shall not to exceed $6.5M.

<p>1.3. HERBICIDE. Herbicide treatment shall be used on all hardwood stumps. The Contractor shall treat stumps within 30 minutes of cutting with a herbicide approved by the COR.

<p><br />6. SITE INVESTIGATION. A site visit to review on-site conditions is recommended. To schedule a site visit, contact Ms. Carol Banaitis at 919-846-9332, X226.</p>
<p><br />7. VEHICLES. All vehicles utilized under this contract shall comply with all applicable Federal and State motor vehicle regulations. The Contractor shall not drive off the paved or gravel access roads at any time without prior approval of the COR.</p>
<p><br />8. SAFETY. The Contractor shall perform the work in a safe and environmentally acceptable manner, and require employees to use such safety devices, methods and measures as are required to protect employees or others against bodily injury or damage to property.</p>
<p><br />9. CONTRACTOR SUPERVISION AND QUALITY CONTROL. The Contractor shall provide all on-site supervision during the work in progress required under this contract. The Contractor may provide his representative (i.e., personnel superintendent or foreman) with written authority to act on his behalf; however, he/she must speak English fluently and thoroughly understand the contract scope of work.</p>
<p><br />10. OTHER CONTRACTORS WORKING IN AREA. Other Contractors and Corps of Engineers employees may be in close proximity to the Contractor's designated area of work. The Contractor shall cooperate fully with all Contractors in the area and shall not impede the work of others in any way.</p>

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

Cyclical droughts, exacerbated by a rapidly growing population and limited government capacity, have led to chronic food insecurity and water shortages in Ethiopia.  Major drought and famine episodes in 1984/1985, 1993 to 1999, 2002/2003, and 2005 have rendered several areas of Ethiopia increasingly vulnerable to emergencies, while the cumulative effects of multiple crises have exhausted many household coping mechanisms.  The repeated failure of the short rains has adversely affected crop production and resulted in significant livestock losses due to severe shortages of water and pasture.  Since 1991, USAID has provided more than $2.85 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, including $161.2 million in USAID/OFDA emergency interventions.  USAID has deployed humanitarian assessment teams, including Disaster Assistance Response Teams, to Ethiopia in 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2006.

Since the 2002/2003 emergency, USAID/OFDA has adopted a more comprehensive approach to saving lives and alleviating human suffering in Ethiopia, focusing on livelihood interventions that complement emergency assistance, while promoting economic resilience and diverse strategies to break the cycle of famine and poverty.  In a shift towards more sustainable solutions to address recurrent emergency problems, USAID/OFDA assists vulnerable families in undertaking a variety of activities to enhance coping mechanisms at the household level to improve food security.  Current USAID/OFDA interventions, including cash-for-work programs, livestock health activities, and livelihoods fairs, meet immediate emergency needs while helping to develop household and community assets for the long-term benefit of drought-affected regions.

However, communities in Ethiopia remain vulnerable due to endemic poverty, chronic malnutrition, high cereal prices, limited access to water and pasture, conflict, localized agricultural failure, and other shocks.  Approximately 8 million people continue to receive food or cash assistance through the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (GFDRE) Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), which is funded by multiple donors.  The delayed onset and poor performance of the March to April belg rains, combined with the failure of the previous two consecutive rains, has resulted in below normal harvests and diminished pasture throughout Somali, Oromiya, and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples (SNNP) regions.  Significant humanitarian challenges, including flooding, conflict, malnutrition, acute watery diarrhea (AWD) outbreaks, delayed food response, and locust infestations, confront populations in many areas of the country.  In Somali Region, insurgent activity and security operations have disrupted trade networks, and restrictions on the movement of people and livestock, combined with the onset of drought conditions, have exacerbated food insecurity for vulnerable populations.  In April 2008, the GFDRE, United Nations (UN), and humanitarian partners launched an appeal for $67.7 million for Ethiopia, requesting emergency assistance for approximately 2.2 million people.

OFDA has maintained a programmatic presence in Ethiopia since the 1999-2000 conflict with Eritrea. The OFDA program office is located within the USAID Mission in Addis Ababa and works collaboratively with all USAID/Ethiopia teams and particularly closely with the Alternative Livelihoods and Transition (ALT) office.  This team consists of OFDAs East and Central Africa Regional Office (ECARO) based in Nairobi, which is led by a Principal Regional Advisor (ECARO/PRA) and includes a Regional Advisor (ECARO/RA) with specific responsibility for Ethiopia; and the East and Central Africa (ECA) team in Washington, D.C., which is led by a Regional Coordinator (RC) and includes a Disaster Operations Specialist (DOS) with specific responsibility for Ethiopia.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA must recruit a Senior Program Officer for Ethiopia in order to meet its program objectives.  The incumbent will serve as a primary point of contact for OFDA in the field and is responsible for developing and implementing OFDAs response and disaster risk reduction strategies and plans, overseeing program and transition staff, ensuring adequate coordination with USAID/Ethiopia, providing leadership within the international community on humanitarian issues, and ensuring OFDA reporting on the humanitarian situation is timely and adequate.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.  The Senior Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.

The Senior Program Officer's responsibilities will include the following:

 Serve as the principal contact point for OFDA in Ethiopia for humanitarian and transition issues, coordinating closely with the ECARO, ECA, and USAID/Ethiopia/ALT teams.

 Supervise program staff consisting of U.S. Personal Services Contractors (USPSCs) and Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs).  Work in close consultation with the ECARO/PRA to ensure that competencies of USPSCs and FSNs are effectively utilized to enhance the overall U.S. Government (USG) response.

 Serve a primary role in the development of OFDAs response and disaster risk reduction strategies in Ethiopia, ensure complementarity between the two strategies, and oversee implementation of each.

 Assess a broad spectrum of emergency conditions and provide recommendations, management oversight, and evaluation of OFDA response programs.

 Maintain regular contact with senior leadership within the humanitarian community and represent USAID/OFDA on humanitarian issues. This will include, but is not limited to, UN agencies, international organizations (IOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), U.S. Government personnel, donors, Ethiopian authorities, and others on humanitarian issues.

 Travel frequently to assess, evaluate and monitor humanitarian conditions in Ethiopia, and make strategic recommendations for appropriate interventions.

 Participate in and report on joint donor humanitarian evaluations and UN - led assessments, and participate actively in the international community response structures.

 Provide regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia.  Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the ECARO/PRA, ECARO/ RA, RC, and DOS current on response issues.  Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts.

 Participate in development and implementation of USAID/OFDA strategy and plans for Ethiopia.

 Along with ECARO/PRA and ECARO/RA, coordinate with the donor community on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations, and develop integrated, non-duplicative programs.

 Prepare agendas and briefings for visiting USG officials interested in humanitarian issues.

 Assist in humanitarian assistance activities in the East and Central Africa region in response to crisis situations.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Senior Program Officer will report directly to the Principal Regional Advisor for East and Central Africa Regional Office or his/her designee in Nairobi, Kenya, and maintain close coordination with the Regional Coordinator in Washington, D.C.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The supervisor will provide administrative direction in terms of broadly defined goals and objectives.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with minimal direction and will exercise independent judgment in responding to humanitarian needs.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

Cyclical droughts, exacerbated by a rapidly growing population and limited government capacity, have led to chronic food insecurity and water shortages in Ethiopia.  Major drought and famine episodes in 1984/1985, 1993 to 1999, 2002/2003, and 2005 have rendered several areas of Ethiopia increasingly vulnerable to emergencies, while the cumulative effects of multiple crises have exhausted many household coping mechanisms.  The repeated failure of the short rains has adversely affected crop production and resulted in significant livestock losses due to severe shortages of water and pasture.  Since 1991, USAID has provided more than $2.85 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, including $161.2 million in USAID/OFDA emergency interventions.  USAID has deployed humanitarian assessment teams, including Disaster Assistance Response Teams, to Ethiopia in 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2006.

Since the 2002/2003 emergency, USAID/OFDA has adopted a more comprehensive approach to saving lives and alleviating human suffering in Ethiopia, focusing on livelihood interventions that complement emergency assistance, while promoting economic resilience and diverse strategies to break the cycle of famine and poverty.  In a shift towards more sustainable solutions to address recurrent emergency problems, USAID/OFDA assists vulnerable families in undertaking a variety of activities to enhance coping mechanisms at the household level to improve food security.  Current USAID/OFDA interventions, including cash-for-work programs, livestock health activities, and livelihoods fairs, meet immediate emergency needs while helping to develop household and community assets for the long-term benefit of drought-affected regions.

However, communities in Ethiopia remain vulnerable due to endemic poverty, chronic malnutrition, high cereal prices, limited access to water and pasture, conflict, localized agricultural failure, and other shocks.  Approximately 8 million people continue to receive food or cash assistance through the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (GFDRE) Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), which is funded by multiple donors.  The delayed onset and poor performance of the March to April belg rains, combined with the failure of the previous two consecutive rains, has resulted in below normal harvests and diminished pasture throughout Somali, Oromiya, and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples (SNNP) regions.  Significant humanitarian challenges, including flooding, conflict, malnutrition, acute watery diarrhea (AWD) outbreaks, delayed food response, and locust infestations, confront populations in many areas of the country.  In Somali Region, insurgent activity and security operations have disrupted trade networks, and restrictions on the movement of people and livestock, combined with the onset of drought conditions, have exacerbated food insecurity for vulnerable populations.  In April 2008, the GFDRE, United Nations (UN), and humanitarian partners launched an appeal for $67.7 million for Ethiopia, requesting emergency assistance for approximately 2.2 million people.

OFDA has maintained a programmatic presence in Ethiopia since the 1999-2000 conflict with Eritrea. The OFDA program office is located within the USAID Mission in Addis Ababa and works collaboratively with all USAID/Ethiopia teams and particularly closely with the Alternative Livelihoods and Transition (ALT) office.  This team consists of OFDAs East and Central Africa Regional Office (ECARO) based in Nairobi, which is led by a Principal Regional Advisor (ECARO/PRA) and includes a Regional Advisor (ECARO/RA) with specific responsibility for Ethiopia; and the East and Central Africa (ECA) team in Washington, D.C., which is led by a Regional Coordinator (RC) and includes a Disaster Operations Specialist (DOS) with specific responsibility for Ethiopia.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA must recruit a Program Officer for Ethiopia in order to meet its program objectives.  The incumbent will serve as a member of OFDAs Ethiopia Program Office and will be the primary point of contact for the implementation of OFDAs response activities

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The OFDA Program Officer will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of the humanitarian emergency efforts throughout Ethiopia, under the direction of the Senior Program Officer.  This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.  The Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  

The Program Officer's responsibilities will include the following:

 Serve as the principal in-country point of contact for OFDA assistance awardees and advise OFDA Cognizant Technical Officer on award issues from development through implementation.

 In close coordination with the ECARO/RA and the DOS, work with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs), and UN agencies that are developing proposals for OFDA (including grant amendments and extensions).  Ensure that draft proposals are in compliance with OFDA's Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting.  Review concept papers and proposals, and provide recommendations/comments to OFDA for final funding determination.

 Participate, as requested by the Senior Program Officer, on a broad spectrum of assessments of emergency conditions and assist in the development programmatic recommendations and implementation mechanisms for OFDAs response programs.

 Maintain regular contact with OFDA grantees, as well as other UN agencies, IOs, and NGOs.  Meet regularly with U.S. Government (USG) personnel, donors, Ethiopian authorities, and others on humanitarian issues.  As requested by Senior Program Officer, represent OFDA at humanitarian coordination meetings.

 Travel frequently to assess, evaluate and monitor conditions at OFDA project sites in Ethiopia.  Report to OFDA CTO on the quality of the grantees work, noting deficiencies, attributes and evolving operational conditions, in close coordination with the ECARO/RA.

 Provide regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia.  Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the ECARO/PRA, ECARO/ RA, RC, and DOS current on response issues.  Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts.

 Prepare agendas and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.

 Assist in humanitarian assistance activities in the East and Central Africa region; serve as a critical component of a USG disaster assessment team, DART, RMT, or backfill other staff members in the overseas office, in response to crisis situations.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Program Officer will report to the Senior Program Officer in OFDAs Ethiopia Program Office, and maintain close coordination with the Regional Advisor in Nairobi and the Disaster Operations Specialist in Washington, D.C.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The supervisor will set overall objectives and will work with the Program Officer to determine deadlines and work priorities.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and perform with moderate direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies as part of a fast-paced office environment.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.

13.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.

(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

Cyclical droughts, exacerbated by a rapidly growing population and limited government capacity, have led to chronic food insecurity and water shortages in Ethiopia.  Major drought and famine episodes in 1984/1985, 1993 to 1999, 2002/2003, and 2005 have rendered several areas of Ethiopia increasingly vulnerable to emergencies, while the cumulative effects of multiple crises have exhausted many household coping mechanisms.  The repeated failure of the short rains has adversely affected crop production and resulted in significant livestock losses due to severe shortages of water and pasture.  Since 1991, USAID has provided more than $2.85 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, including $161.2 million in USAID/OFDA emergency interventions.  USAID has deployed humanitarian assessment teams, including Disaster Assistance Response Teams, to Ethiopia in 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2006.

Since the 2002/2003 emergency, USAID/OFDA has adopted a more comprehensive approach to saving lives and alleviating human suffering in Ethiopia, focusing on livelihood interventions that complement emergency assistance, while promoting economic resilience and diverse strategies to break the cycle of famine and poverty.  In a shift towards more sustainable solutions to address recurrent emergency problems, USAID/OFDA assists vulnerable families in undertaking a variety of activities to enhance coping mechanisms at the household level to improve food security.  Current USAID/OFDA interventions, including cash-for-work programs, livestock health activities, and livelihoods fairs, meet immediate emergency needs while helping to develop household and community assets for the long-term benefit of drought-affected regions.

However, communities in Ethiopia remain vulnerable due to endemic poverty, chronic malnutrition, high cereal prices, limited access to water and pasture, conflict, localized agricultural failure, and other shocks.  Approximately 8 million people continue to receive food or cash assistance through the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (GFDRE) Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), which is funded by multiple donors.  The delayed onset and poor performance of the March to April belg rains, combined with the failure of the previous two consecutive rains, has resulted in below normal harvests and diminished pasture throughout Somali, Oromiya, and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples (SNNP) regions.  Significant humanitarian challenges, including flooding, conflict, malnutrition, acute watery diarrhea (AWD) outbreaks, delayed food response, and locust infestations, confront populations in many areas of the country.  In Somali Region, insurgent activity and security operations have disrupted trade networks, and restrictions on the movement of people and livestock, combined with the onset of drought conditions, have exacerbated food insecurity for vulnerable populations.  In April 2008, the GFDRE, United Nations (UN), and humanitarian partners launched an appeal for $67.7 million for Ethiopia, requesting emergency assistance for approximately 2.2 million people.

OFDA has maintained a programmatic presence in Ethiopia since the 1999-2000 conflict with Eritrea. The OFDA program office is located within the USAID Mission in Addis Ababa and works collaboratively with all USAID/Ethiopia teams and particularly closely with the Alternative Livelihoods and Transition (ALT) office.  This team consists of OFDAs East and Central Africa Regional Office (ECARO) based in Nairobi, which is led by a Principal Regional Advisor (ECARO/PRA) and includes a Regional Advisor (ECARO/RA) with specific responsibility for Ethiopia; and the East and Central Africa (ECA) team in Washington, D.C., which is led by a Regional Coordinator (RC) and includes a Disaster Operations Specialist (DOS) with specific responsibility for Ethiopia.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA must recruit a Transition Officer for Ethiopia in order to meet its program objectives.  The incumbent will serve as a member of OFDAs Ethiopia Program Office and will be the primary point of contact for the implementation of OFDAs disaster risk reduction and transition activities. This will include working closely with USAID/Ethiopia and the OFDA regional team to implement the existing transition/disaster risk reduction strategy and to identify and prioritize new opportunities.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The OFDA Transition Officer will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of transition and disaster risk reduction efforts in Ethiopia, under the direction of the Senior Program Officer. This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.  The Transition Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.

The Transition Officers responsibilities will include the following:

 Serve as the principal in-country point of contact for OFDA transition and disaster risk reduction activities.

	Facilitate, track, and ensure implementation of OFDAs transition and disaster risk reduction strategy. This will include maintaining OFDA representation on relevant USAID/Ethiopia design, selection, and implementation committees, ensuring OFDA technical input at each stage of the process, and representing OFDA on joint USAID/Ethiopia-OFDA funded initiatives.

 Identify and prioritize new opportunities for implementation of OFDAs disaster risk reduction and transition strategy in Ethiopia, and provide recommendations to the Senior Program Officer.

 Work with the OFDA Program Officer to ensure response activities leverage disaster risk reduction opportunities where possible, and systematically implement OFDAs transition strategy.

 In close coordination with the ECARO/RA and the DOS, work with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs), and UN agencies that are developing disaster risk reduction proposals for OFDA (including grant amendments and extensions, review drafts and ensure that proposals are in compliance with OFDA's Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting.  Review concept papers and proposals, and provide recommendations/comments to OFDA for final funding determination.

 Travel as necessary to assess, evaluate and monitor conditions and provide recommendations for transition and disaster risk reduction opportunities.

 Provide regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to transition and disaster risk reduction efforts in Ethiopia.  Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the transition and disaster risk reduction and keep the ECARO/PRA, ECARO/ RA, RC, and DOS current progress of the initiatives.  Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact implementation of the transition and disaster risk reduction strategy.

 Assist in the preparation of agendas and briefings for official U.S. Government (USG) visitors interested in humanitarian issues.

 Assist in humanitarian assistance activities in the East and Central Africa region, serve as a critical component of a USG disaster assessment team, DART, or RMT, or backfill other staff members in the overseas office, in response to crisis situations.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Transition Officer will report to the Senior Program Officer in OFDAs Ethiopia Program Office, and maintain close coordination with the Regional Advisor in Nairobi and the Disaster Operations Specialist in Washington, D.C.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The supervisor will set overall objectives and will work with the Transition Officer to determine deadlines and work priorities.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and perform with moderate direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies as part of a fast-paced office environment.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.

13.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>Question Received from a prospective Bidder.
Question: 
Why isn't the ADS40 pushbroom sensor allowed to be used for the project? It appears from the scope of services that all work can be performed with this sensor. We would further argue that the accuracy achieved may be better than that achieved from frame camera technology, considering the lack of ground control, since there will be less image mosaicing required with ADS40 image capture. 
Answer:
This work is part of a research project funded by and done in collaboration with the NRCS National Resource Inventory (NRI) program.  The NRI decided to go with digital frame camera technology, not pushbroom sensors, despite the potential advantages.  The imagery requested needs to be captured using technology similar to that used by the NRI.

<DESC>1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a  better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot Schools 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are  solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this  RFI. 4. Contractors interested in responding to the request shall provide  answers to the attached questions in the order indicated below and provide  any additional information to this office by COB 9 Feb 07. Please send correspondence to Attn: Capt Brandon Ledbetter, Program Manager (937) 904-4162 e-mail brandon.ledbetter@wpafb.af.mil or Mr. George Sarmiento, Program Manager (937) 904-4307, george.sarmiento@wpafb.af.mil   Please limit your response  to no more than 10 single-sided 8  x 11 pages, double-spaced, minimum 12 point  font size. 1 Attachment RFI Questions Attachment 1 RFI Questions 1.

<DESC>Addition Information (29 Jun 07): The attached questions and answers were taken from Panel Discussions at  T-38C IBSP Industry Days on 12 Jun 07. Addition Information: The attached performance specifications were developed during a two year  risk reduction activity.  These performance specifications define key  envelope information, desired system performance and testing requirements.  The attached specifications are provided as a baseline reference to aid in  the development and qualification of your proposed design.  In the  interest of best value, potential offerors are encouraged to review and  propose any improvements and/or modifications to the performance  specifications. 1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a  better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot Schools 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are  solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this  RFI. 4.

We will  record each question submitted prior to the telecon anonymously as a  "Contractor Question," and if possible, we will address each question  during the telecon.  If time allows, additional questions will be fielded  during the telecon, and if possible a real-time "Government Answer."  In  the event we need to conduct further research, the answer will be included  in a follow-on PIXS posting that records each "Contractor Question" and  the "Government Answer."   Again, if possible, please send your questions  in advance to the Contract Negotiator (karen.shelley@wpafb.af.mil).  The  toll number for foreign companies is 1-210-839-8503 and please use the  above Participant Code. DRAFT SOO Info (17 Aug 07): The attached draft IBSP Statement of Objectives (SOO) is being released  for Industry comment. In the next two weeks we will also be releasing the  draft System Requirement Document, a draft Section M and a draft Section L  for Industry comment.   Please send written comments to Ms Karen Shelley  (Karen.Shelley@wpafb.af.mil) and in the r-mail subject line please add the  name of the document to which the comments refer (EX:  SOO - Comments,  SRD - Comments). Be advised, that it is likely that the complete DRFP release will be  delayed until Sep and RFP release not until Oct.  If you have any  questions, you can contact the acting program manager, George Sarmiento,  at his new e-mail address:  george.sarmiento2@wpafb.af.mil or myself. Additional Information (29 Jun 07): T-38C Improved Braking System Program (IBSP) Drawings Available Upon  Request The drawings referenced in section two of the wheel and brake notional  system/testing baseline for the T-38C IBSP are now available.  To request  a copy, please email Karen Shelley at Karen.Shelley@wpafb.af.mil. Addition Information (29 Jun 07): The attached questions and answers were taken from Panel Discussions at  T-38C IBSP Industry Days on 12 Jun 07. Addition Information: The attached performance specifications were developed during a two year  risk reduction activity.  These performance specifications define key  envelope information, desired system performance and testing requirements.  The attached specifications are provided as a baseline reference to aid in  the development and qualification of your proposed design.  In the  interest of best value, potential offerors are encouraged to review and  propose any improvements and/or modifications to the performance  specifications. 1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a  better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot Schools 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are  solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this  RFI. 4. Contractors interested in responding to the request shall provide  answers to the attached questions in the order indicated below and provide  any additional information to this office by COB 9 Feb 07. Please send correspondence to Attn: Capt Brandon Ledbetter, Program Manager (937) 904-4162 e-mail brandon.ledbetter@wpafb.af.mil or Mr. George Sarmiento, Program Manager (937) 904-4307, george.sarmiento@wpafb.af.mil   Please limit your response  to no more than 10 single-sided 8  x 11 pages, double-spaced, minimum 12 point  font size. 1 Attachment RFI Questions Attachment 1 RFI Questions 1.

<DESC><p><br />21 CONS is posting this Amendment 2 to the Solicitation for # FA2517-07-R-5001, Custodial Services for Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) and Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station (CMAFS).
<p>1. The offer due dated is changed. Change SF 1449, block 8, offer due date to read: 4:00PM, 10 Jul 08.<br />2. Changed documents (marked with asterisk) and additional documents attached to this amendment and incorporated to the solicitation are: <br />Attachment 1 - PWS with Appendix *1 &amp; *1A <br />Appendix 2 and 3 provided to awardee only<br />Appendixes 4 - 6 are included in PWS<br />*Attachment 2 - Proposal Schedule Exhibits A - K Examples 25 Jun 08<br />*Attachment 3 - Proposal Sched Exh A-K KTR Fill-in 25Jun08<br />*Attachment 6 - Area Wage Determination AWD 29 May 08 <br />Added Attachment 11 - Site Visit Minutes.doc<br />Added Attachment 11A - Site Visit Intinerary<br />Added Attachment 12 - Q &amp; A 18 thru 27 June 08<br />3. Change Appendix 1 and 1A is changed to show the change in the calculation methodology. The original methodology used to calculate the "Total Frequency Average for Building" for Appendix A (Exhibit A and B) and 1A (Exhibit F and G) did not represent an accurate amount of square footage for the identified frequency. The average was not taking into consideration the various frequencies for each facility as well as the square footage variability. Therefore, the "Frequency" was adjusted to account for every square foot and the amount it is serviced. This caused both up and down fluctuations, but does use a pinpoint number instead of an average.<br />4. Change Attachment 2 - Proposal Schedule Exhibits A - K Examples 25 Jun 08, to show the change in the calculation methodology.<br />5. Change Attachment 3 - Proposal Sched Exh A-K KTR Fill-in 25Jun08, to show the change in the calculation methodology.<br />6. Update for Attachment 6 - Area Wage Determination AWD 29 May 08.<br />7. Attachment 11 and 11A, Site Visit Minutes and Intinerary is added for offerors review.<br />8. Attachment 12, offeror Questions and Government Answers from 18 thru 27 June 2008 are added for offeror review. <br />9. Amendment 2 RFP released 30 June 08, Page 3, Table of Contents is updated, to add attachments 11, 11A, and 12.<br />10. Amendment 2 RFP released 30 June 08, FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Table of Contents is updated to add attachments 11, 11A, and 12.

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit comments from potential sources from academia and industry on the solicitation approach and the clarity of the High Performance Computing Modernization Program Offices (HPCMPO) draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) for the User Productivity Enhancement, Technology Transfer and Training (PETTT) Program.   This RFI and the SOO may be viewed on the DoD HPCMP web site at http://www.hpcmo.hpc.mil/PETTT business_opps.htm .  The HPCMPO was established in 1993 to perform life cycle management and acquisition oversight for the High Performance Computing (HPC) needs of the defense Science and Technology (S&T) and Test and Evaluation (T&E) communities.  The purpose of the PETTT Program is to enable the flow of computational science and related technology and help fulfill the research and development objectives of the DoD high performance computing user community.  PETTT will focus on enhancing user productivity through technology transition, training and support.  The predecessor contract of the User Productivity Enhancement, Technology Transfer and Training (PETTT) activity has introduced tools and techniques from various computational communities and brokered collaborative activities with government agencies, industry, and academia.  The PETTT activity under this solicitation will further facilitate collaborations among DoD researchers and world-class institutions on computational problems of significant interest for national defense.  The Government anticipates the following solicitation approach for the PETTT contract: (1) this RFI, (2) a pre-proposal Bidders Response identifying a technical/management approach based on the SOO, and (3) a formal Technical/Management and Cost Proposal based on a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government will hold one-on-one bidders conferences with prospective bidders during the pre-proposal phase as well as the RFP phase.  Based on the bidders responses and the bidders conference during the pre-proposal phase, the Government will generate a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  This, together with the SOO will dictate the Governments requirements for PETTT and form the basis for a formal request for proposals (RFP) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the FAR Part 15.  The Government anticipates awarding a single Award Fee contract with a Base and four option periods. The Government envisions that the most productive form of the contract will result from a consortium of university and industry partners.  The expected award date is May 2009.  This is a Request for Information only.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this posting.
Written responses to this RFI may be submitted to the General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Services, Assisted Acquisition Services Division, 950 22nd Street North, Suite 600, Birmingham, AL 35203, Attn. Ms. Deborah Joeckel, by 30 June 2008.  Electronic copies are preferred and should be sent via e-mail to eddie.mills@gsa.gov with a copy to deborah.joeckel@gsa.gov in PDF format.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled DRAFT STAND ALONE MISSIONS OFOPPORTUNITY NOTICE ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY which was posted on March 13, 2008.Subject: Lunar Dust Detector Instrument Opportunity Added to SALMONLUNAR DUST DETECTOR INSTRUMENT OPPORTUNITY ADDED TO SALMON AO The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Stand Alone Missions ofOpportunity Notice (SALMON), is intended to provide opportunities for science andtechnology investigations on space flight missions that advance the high priorityscience, technology, and exploration objectives of NASAs four Mission Directorates. Thisfive-year omnibus Announcement of Opportunity (AO) incorporates Program ElementAppendices (PEAs) for general Mission of Opportunity (MO) proposal opportunities as wellas focused proposal opportunities for specific flight opportunities.A new PEA will be added to the AO presenting a Focused Opportunity for an in-situ lunardust detector instrument to be placed on the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust EnvironmentExplorer (LADEE) mission. The LADEE mission is a small focused mission intended toexplore the tenuous lunar atmosphere and dust environment before that environment isaltered by extended human activity on the Moon.  LADEE is planned to carry a sciencepayload of three instruments; a neutral mass spectrometer, an Ultraviolet-Visiblespectrometer, and an in-situ dust detector.  This SALMON PEA seeks proposals only for thein-situ dust instrument.NASA plans to solicit an instrument capable of directly detecting dust grains at theroughly 50 km expected LADEE orbit. It is expected that the lunar surface-lofted dustcomponent will consist of sub-micron grains traveling at relatively slow speeds. Thedensity of dust at 50 km is expected to be on the order of 10-4/cc.  The LADEE mission can accommodate an in-situ dust instrument with the followinglimitations:	Total instrument mass: 3 kg + reserve appropriate for its level of maturity;	Power provided: 28 Volts unregulated;	Continuous power: 5 W (higher peak power may be available at times);	Continuous science data rate: 1 kbps (on-board data storage available);	Pointing capability of spacecraft: 3-axis stabilized within 5 degrees; and	Pointing knowledge provided by spacecraft: 1 degree.NASA is targeting an allocation of $5M for this instrument.NASA expects this PEA will be released along with the final version of the SALMON AO nolater than August 2008 (the SALMON draft AO can be viewed at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/    , select Solicitations, select Closed Solicitations, select SALMON DRAFT).  Further information about the LADEE mission and anticipated payload will be madeavailable in the SALMON reference library at http://salmon.larc.nasa.gov/      .  Proposals for this PEA will be due 60 to 90 days from the date of release. This PEA and the SALMON AO are in the process of being formally approved by NASA.However, by sending this announcement to prospective investigators at this time (prior torelease), NASA is under no obligation to issue the AO and solicit proposals. Any costsincurred by prospective investigators in preparing submissions in response to thisannouncement are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk.Further information will be posted at http://salmon.larc.nasa.gov/	as it becomesavailable. Questions may be addressed to Dr. Sarah Noble, Planetary Science Division,Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546; Tel.: (202) 358-3725; Email:Sarah.K.Noble@nasa.gov.

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information: High Throughput Screening Approaches for Toxicology
<SOLNBR>
<RESPDATE>081108
<CONTACT>Jennifer Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 919-541-0424, Fax 919-541-2712, Email smithj3@niehs.nih.gov - 
<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI): High Throughput Screening Approaches for Toxicology</p>
<p>Issued by<br />National Toxicology Program (NTP) (http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov)<br />National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) (http://www.niehs.nih.gov)</p>
<p>This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) and is for planning purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this RFI will be the outcome of the competitive process. Any purchases that might result from information received or derived from this RFI will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Background <br />The National Toxicology Program (NTP) in its Roadmap for the 21st Century (available at http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/vision) is interested in identifying or developing rapid, mechanism-based predictive screening assays for use in toxicity determinations. Through its High Throughput Screening (HTS) Initiative (http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/hts), the NTP is collaborating with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast Program (http://epa.gov/ncct/toxcast/) and the National Human Genome Research Institute's NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) (http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/index.html) to investigate the application of HTS approaches for defining toxicity profiles of environmental compounds to use in hazard identification and risk assessment.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />To ensure development of a rigorous and comprehensive battery of HTS assays, the NTP seeks information and comments on the identification and selection of critical cellular toxicity pathways for interrogation in cell-based high throughput screens. The NTP is also interested in receiving recommendations on particular molecular targets within these critical cellular toxicity pathways that are most informative for profiling the pathways, both in cell-based and biochemical assay formats. In addition to information on cellular pathways and targets, the NTP seeks information on technologies and assay systems that might be used in the development of a comprehensive approach to high throughput toxicity screening.</p>
<p>Forum <br />An informational meeting, open to the public, will be held on September 11-12, 2008, at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, 111 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709. Attendance at the meeting is limited only by the available space. The purpose of this meeting is for interested parties to provide the Government information about assays, molecular targets, and cellular pathways through brief presentations and a question and answer session. Any interested party may attend. Parties interested in making a presentation at the meeting must register on the meeting website (http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/32908). Attendees not making presentations are also encouraged to register at the website for planning purposes. The Government anticipates that registered presenters will be allotted 20 minutes each for presentations (limit of one speaker per organization); however, the Government retains the right to limit the number of presentations and/or limit the allotted time for presentations based upon the number of registered presenters. <br />Presenters will be notified about the scheduled order of presentations and the list of presenters will be posted on the meeting website at least one week prior to the meeting. It is anticipated that the meeting will include time for questions and information exchange. The slides from the presentations may appear in internal reports or be made public. Further information is available on the meeting website.</p>
<p>Persons needing interpreting services in order to attend should contact 301-402-8180 (voice) or 301-435-1908 (TTY). For other accommodations while on NIEHS campus, contact 919-541-2475 or email niehsoeeo@niehs.nih.gov</p>
<p>Dates: Registration deadline for presenters is August 11, 2008. The number of registered presenters will be limited to approximately 25. The date for submission of the 1-page description of the presentation is also August 11 (see "Responses to the RFI"). Nonpresenters may register online through September 9, 2008, or until capacity is reached.</p>
<p>Location: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,<br />Rodbell Auditorium, 111 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709</p>
<p>Contact information: Questions should be directed to Jennifer Smith, Contract Specialist, by telephone (919-541-0424) or email (smithj3@niehs.nih.gov). Questions and answers will be posted on the website as a resource to all prospective participants. Any indentifying information will be removed before posting.</p>
<p>Responses to RFI<br />The Government requests a brief (no more than 1 page) description of the proposed presentation addressing one or more of the points listed below or other directly related topics. In considering responses to this RFI, please keep in mind the assay protocol requirements for assays run at the NCGC (http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/guidance/HTS_Assay_Guidance_Criteria.html).</p>
<p>&bull; Recommendations on the identification and selection of critical cellular pathways involved in toxicity and associated with a phenotypic manifestation of toxicity in vivo (disease outcome).</p>
<p>&bull; Information on assays that can be used to measure the activity of a compound on a target within a critical pathway.</p>
<p>&bull; Information on the selection of the best targets within pathways and networks in order to accurately and fully characterize the activity of a compound within a specific pathway or the ability of a compound to trigger a stress-responsive pathway resulting in a defined toxicity or disease.</p>
<p>&bull; Information on assays, technologies, or methods that will aid in identifying compounds that are active only after metabolic activation.</p>
<p>&bull; New technologies or technologies under development that can be exploited in HTS programs, such as those underway at the NCGC or as secondary, targeted, follow-up testing to expand and more carefully characterize the findings from initial screens.</p>
<p>All responses should include the following information: company name, company address, name of presenter, telephone number, and e-mail address. Responses should be submitted by August 11, 2008, either electronically via the meeting website or by fax, email, or mail to</p>
<p>Jennifer Smith, Contract Specialist<br />NIEHS<br />P.O. Box 12874, Mail drop EC-02<br />79 T.W. Alexander Drive, Building 4401, Room 134<br />Research Triangle Park, NC 27709<br />fax: 919-541-2712<br />email: smithj3@niehs.nih.gov</p>
<p>Responses will be reviewed to ensure that the Government, by extending an invitation to a party to participate in the RFI meeting, will receive information directly relevant to its HTS program for toxicity assessment and that the party fully understands the nature of the meeting and the type of information sought. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made nor will respondents be notified of the Government's assessment of the information received. No basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or in the Government's use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or to develop specifications for any subsequent announcement. Responses will not be returned. The summarized responses (without identifiers) may appear in internal reports or be made public. Although the NIH will provide safeguards to prevent the release of identifying information, there is no guarantee of confidentiality.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on behalf of and as an agent of the Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified ventilators to be a necessity for pandemic flu preparedness and response.  The purpose of this solicitation is to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for portable ventilators (all same make and model) with delivery to stockpile location(s) in support of pandemic flu preparedness and response.  Resulting awardee shall also be capable of providing re-supply kits, along with end-user training and sustain a 60-month (five year) maintenance support agreement that will include rotation of approximately one third of the ventilators shipping from Government location to offerors location for annual preventative and recertification maintenance.  The objective is to insure availability and consistency of product for stockpile and if need be, deployment in the event of pandemic flu outbreak.  The base contract period will be for one year (or less, depending on date of award), with one (4) option periods that may be exercised by the Government.   It is the Governments desire that the contractor shall provide consistent deliveries of portable ventilators and re-supply kits within an 18-month period.  Offerors are requested to propose a delivery schedule that can be accomplished within this timeframe or sooner and if not within this timeframe, include appropriate reasons why not.  Delivery shall be within the continental United States.  NOTE: Due to the national security and sensitive aspects of this program, information such as final delivery location(s) and point of contact(s) are considered confidential and as such shall only be disclosed to the resultant awardee.  Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of this procurement the contractor and affiliates shall be required to complete a confidentiality agreement within five (5) days of award.  Offeror must be able to provide standard commercial warranty term of at least one year after date of shipment as part of the mandatory characteristics (minimum requirements).  Because of the uniqueness of the DSNS stockpile program and this related procurement, the Government desires a warranty term that would begin at the point of 1st deployment of ventilators and continue through one year.  Offerors are encouraged to consider this optional characteristic provision and to include their response to this provision in the business proposal.  This provision as it is offered will be included in the price analysis portion of the evaluation.  Distributors/dealers are required to submit a letter from the manufacturer/s of the offered portable ventilators guaranteeing a source of supply for the term of the contract.  This letter must be from the manufacturer and on the manufacturers stationary.  Offers from distributors/dealers that do not submit the letter of commitment from the manufacturer will be rejected.
