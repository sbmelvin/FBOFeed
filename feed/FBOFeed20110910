<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) intends to award a sole source contract to Roche Diagnostics Corp. located in Indianapolis, IN for a LightCycler 480 Real-time PCR System II. The requirement is for the LightCycler 480 Instrument, LightCycler 480 Probes Master (5x1 ML), Multiwell Plate 96, High Resolution Melting (5x1 ML), and extended service coverage. The Light Cycler 480 is the only plate based real-time PCR system to provide multiple ways to perform genetic variation analysis: melting curve with probes, end-point genotyping with probes and high resolution melting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Non-plate based analysis would be inefficient, and dramatically decrease the number of experiments that can be performed in a given tube.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Non-plate-based systems are limited in the number of reactions that can be performed simultaneously (16); the reactions must be prepared in individual tubes. Plate-based equipment allows for the simultaneous processing of 96 or 384 reactions. Thus, in a typical day, assuming each reaction takes one hour to cycle in the machine, a non-plate-based unit could only process 128 reactions, while a plate-based machine could process 768 or 3072 reactions, depending on whether a 96 well or 384 well plate was used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, to process the same experiment, a non-plate based system would require 6-24x the run time (and 6-24x the amount of electricity).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Experiments that might be completed in a single day using a plate-based system would require at least a week using non-plate equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the use of time/labor-saving equipment that facilitates the loading of reactions (e.g. electronic multichannel pipeters, arrayed plates of DNA samples that can be used repeatedly to replicate experiments) is not possible using non-plate based systems, which would increase the amount of time/labor needed to prepare reactions for analysis on the equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because the work in the laboratory involves analysis of populations, the program office may be analyzing many thousands of individuals in a given experiment, using 10-20 different genetic markers, and have to replicate each experiment a minimum of 2-3x.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a plate-based real-time PCR system is essential for the work. The program office does not have the resources or manpower to run non-plate systems and this is the only system that meets the government's requirements. Roche Diagnostics Corp. is the sole source that can meet the government's needs.</p>
<p>Anticipated Date of Award:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>09/16/2011</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a firm-fixed-price contract; on a sole source basis utilizing Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items with Beckman Coulter Genomics, 100 Perimeter Park Drive, Suite C, Morrisville, North Carolina 27560-9203.  The required services entail the performance of 482 new anthrax subject male samples whole blood for mRNA Microarray extraction blood testing; 90 samples retrieval for mRNA microarray testing for bridging, and; 16 DNA extraction blood samples for genotyping, under Other than Full and Open Competition by the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(c) (ii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br><br>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541711 - Research and Development in Biotechnology, and the size standard is 500 Employees.<br> <br>The sole source determination is based on the follow-on contract for the continued testing of subject male samples of whole blood.  These services were awarded competitively to Beckman Coulter Genomics (formerly known as Cogenics, Inc.) in 2007, 2008 and 2009, for the subject female population in support of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases' (USAMRIID's) Research Project Number 07-18 entitled "Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA) - A Systems Biology Approach to Determining the Factors Mediating Safety and Immunogenicity."  <br><br>The primary objective of the award is to obtain written summary results of the metabolic profiling for the subject male testing, and hence, be able to accomplish an analytical comparison between the female and male evaluation reports. <br><br>It is vital that the research project's results be scientifically sound, and therefore, capable of withstanding the greatest amount of scientific question and scrutiny. The testing and evaluation services may only be obtained directly from Beckman Coulter Genomics, which is uniquely qualified to perform all microarray and genomics tests, as well as data analysis since this company provided the exact same testing on the female population regarding this study a few years ago.  The only way to ensure the consistency, uniformity and scientific merit of the tests is for Beckman Coulter Genomics to be the company to perform the testing analysis.  <br><br>The Government is unaware of any other source, other than Beckman Coulter Genomics, that can provide the exact same testing for the subject male as performed on the female population regarding this study.  Minor differences in results of these kind of tests may occur between sources.  Those small differences between vendor's techniques and analysis are enough to compromise the "science" end result. In addition, award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.   <br><br>USAMRAA intends to issue a Firm-Fixed-Price purchase order to Beckman Coulter Genomics for the testing and evaluation of 482 male sample of whole blood unless other sources are identified before response date to this posting.   The period of performance shall be for twelve months from the effective date of award on or about 26 September 2011 - 25 September 2012.<br><br>This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  An RFQ will be available for information purposes only no later than 9/13/2011. However, any interested party that believes it can meet the requirements may submit written notification to the contract specialist of their interest and bona fide capability to fulfill the requirements.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements listed.  Any responses to this synopsis must be provided in writing and shall include evidence of qualifications, experience, past performance, and proposed cost to provide this type of services. Such information will be reviewed to determine if it is necessary to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  <br><br>The due date to submit responses shall be Friday, 23 September 2011; 12:00:00 Noon PM Eastern Standard Time.

<p>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>
<p>*LPO DoDAACs are used for Navy contracts only.</p>
<p><br />(xiv) DPAS Rating does not apply to this acquisition.<br /><br />(xv) Quotes are required to be received NO LATER THAN 1:00 PM, MST, Thursday, 15 SEP 2011. All quotes must be emailed to timothy.west.9@us.af.mil or faxed to (406)731-4005 to the attention of Timothy West. Please follow-up quote submission with a phone call to ensure receipt.</p>

E.3   VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE 

1. GENERAL

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

     a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

     b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.


     c. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

     d. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

     a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

     b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

     c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
 
     d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
     
     e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

     f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

     g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

     h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

     i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

     j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

     k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.


4. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

     a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

     b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.


     c. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

5. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

     a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.

     b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

     c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

    (1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);

    (2) Description of the event, including:

     (a) date of occurrence;

     (b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;

    (3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;

    (4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;

    (5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;

    (6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;

    (7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);

    (8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;

    (9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;

    (10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and

    (11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.

     d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $______ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:

    (1) Notification;

    (2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;

    (3) Data breach analysis;

    (4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;

    (5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and

    (6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

6. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for commercial services. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-53.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990 with a small business size standard of $7.0M. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>Responsible quoters shall provide pricing for all of the following line items:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity (1) Job. The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, travel and services necessary to conduct measurement science for innovative thermal insulation materials in accordance with the following statement of work:</p>
<p>Background<br />The most cost effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with building energy consumption is through the use of thermal insulation. Insulation in the building envelope and thermal devices, such as furnaces, boilers, refrigerators, and air-conditioning units, greatly reduces the need for heating and cooling the space, hot water, and other thermal processes. Accurate determination of the insulating capability of these materials is critical to achieve the energy savings that are expected. A vital aspect of the measurement system for thermal insulation is the availability of reliable methods for determining thermal properties of insulating materials. A key challenge is determining the insulating capabilities of innovative insulating materials. Innovative insulating materials have been proposed to reduce heating and cooling loads in buildings, but the measurement science challenges have not been fully solved. Some materials with potential for greatly reducing energy consumption in buildings include phase change materials, vacuum insulation panels, and micro-porous materials, such as aerogels. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires a critical assessment for such materials to reduce energy consumption in buildings and to address the gaps in the measurement science needed to effectively implement these materials.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this procurement is to develop a written document that describes the technical assessment of innovative insulation materials and the measurement science needed to implement these materials. For the purpose of this solicitation, the term "innovative insulating materials" means state-of-the-art and future building insulation materials.</p>
<p>General Requirements<br />The Contractor must work with NIST to assess the critical measurement science needs in order to implement innovative insulation materials in buildings.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements<br />Requirement #1 - Identification of Materials<br />The Contractor shall identify a minimum of three advanced (non-conventional) insulating materials and/or systems that are intended for use in buildings. The Contractor shall, where possible, organize the materials into generic categories for materials that have common or similar properties. Materials and/or systems to be researched can be materials that are available in the United States and/or internationally.</p>
<p>For all specific categories of advanced insulating material, the Contractor shall provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Manufacturer, trade name, style, other (if applicable). If the material is considered a research material, the Contractor shall identify the university or other entity that is developing the material;</p>
<p>2. Mandatory properties - the properties can be functions of other parameters such as temperature or gas <br />pressure: <br />(i) Bulk density;<br />(ii) Thermal properties including heat transport properties (i.e., thermal conductivity, thermal <br />resistance, thermal resistivity, or thermal conductance) and heat capacity.</p>
<p>3. Other properties of interest as determined by the Contractor;</p>
<p>4. Safety issues - a material safety data sheet (MSDS) must be provided for each commercially available <br />material;</p>
<p>5. The Contractor shall explain why the insulating material is considered non-conventional and how the <br />advanced insulating material is intended to function in a building.</p>
<p>Requirement #2 - Usage in Buildings<br />For each material identified in Requirement #1, the Contractor shall provide information on the usage of the material in a (residential or commercial) building and, address the following questions, at a minimum:</p>
<p>1. What part of the building would the material be installed? For example, the material can be installed in <br />the thermal envelope (foundation, basement, wall, window, roof, other) or in thermal equipment that <br />operates in the building.</p>
<p>2. What, if any, are the concerns about using the material in different geographic locations in the U.S. (i.e., under different climates or elevations);</p>
<p>3. How is the material to be installed? What, if any, are the concerns with the compatibility with adjacent <br />or other materials in the building construction?</p>
<p>4. What is the service life of the material? Are there any concerns with how the thermal properties <br />identified in Requirement #1 change with time? What other factors (such as moisture, among others) <br />may effect the material?</p>
<p>5. How sustainable (i.e., carbon dioxide footprint or other sustainability factor) is the material? What <br />metrics are important for sustainability?</p>
<p>6. Describe the potential energy savings by using the material.</p>
<p>7. What market conditions, if any, are preventing the material from commercial application in buildings?</p>
<p>Requirement #3 - Thermal Performance Evaluation<br />For each material identified in Requirement #1, the Contractor shall provide an in-depth analysis of the material including all of the following information, at a minimum:</p>
<p>1. Describe what are the measurement challenges for determining the thermal performance of the material:<br />in the laboratory; and, in the field.</p>
<p>2. What are the important metrics?</p>
<p>3. What test methods exist or are needed for thermal performance evaluation?</p>
<p>4. What standards exist or are needed?</p>
<p>Requirement #4 - Reporting Requirements Progress Report</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a progress report on a monthly basis which discusses all work completed within the period, the current status of each Specific Requirement, any problems encountered and steps taken to resolve them, and the completion date for each Specific Requirement.</p>
<p>The progress report shall be in Microsoft Word format and shall be forwarded to the technical contact (to be identified in the award) via e-mail not later than the 10th of each month.</p>
<p>Final Report<br />The final report shall include the findings from Requirements #1, #2, and #3. The final report shall also include a summary with recommendations for future measurement research needs. All numerical quantities shall follow NIST Guidelines on the usage of SI units.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The period of performance shall be one year from the date of award.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />All work shall be performed at the Contractor's site.</p>

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.<br><br>(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--<br><br>(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or<br><br>(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).<br><br>(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.<br><br>(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.<br><br>(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. <br><br>(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--<br><br>(i) Making a correct payment;<br><br>(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and<br><br>(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.<br><br>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--<br><br>(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or<br><br>(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.<br><br>(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.<br><br>(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.<br><br>(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.<br><br>(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.<br><br>(End of Clause)<br><br><br><br>52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)<br><br>This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that the Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or by e-mail. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by an e-mail or facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p><br />GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), MLCA Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor, the PBPL Availability Project Manager, and the NESU. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.</p>

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.

     (3) The clause at 52.212-5.

     (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
 
     (7) The Standard Form 1449.
 
     (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments
 
     (9) The specification.
 
   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 
     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the commercial item identified below, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation VA-263-11-RQ-0613 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-53. This acquisition shall use Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), and the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 623110 with the small business size standard of $13.5 million.  
The Sioux Falls VA Health Care System Under Statutory Authority 41 USC 253 (c)(5) and 38 U.S.C. 1720 the Government anticipates entering into acquisition negotiations and award of a Basic Ordering Agreement for placement and services of eligible veterans into a nursing home facility located in Salem, South Dakota, for a Base Year period 8/31/2011-8/30/2011 with four (4) Option Years.  This authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Governments minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available in this location. The nursing facility shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients. Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.  Facility must have and maintain the South Dakota Department of Health Nursing Facility License.
STATEMENT OF WORK:  1.The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patients condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust?  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veterans care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).

16.  The authorization agreement, VA Form 10-7078, and the contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for 15 calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.

A description of the RUG-III systems can be found in 42 CFR Parts 409, et.al.

This constitutes double billing and Federal fraud, (9) The VAMC will pay two-day bed hold for therapeutic passes or re-hospitalization; for longer periods the family must make arrangements with the contract facility to hold a bed.  Reimbursement for all bed holds will be 70% of the prevailing per diem rate.
