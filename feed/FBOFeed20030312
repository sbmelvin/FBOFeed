The complete date for the research is mid-summer 2003.  The OSURF is uniquely qualified due to their experience with field collection of fish as well as skill in genetic blood assays and background in pathology.  Detailed scoring of external abnormalities is being used at OSURF as an indicator of contaminant exposure and effects.  A new comet assay for genetic damage in red blood cell nuclei is also being field tested.  The fish captured in the Ashtabula and Conneaut will be necropsied and scored using the new assay.  All of the Great Lakes fish records of external abnormalities reside at OSURF and can only be accessed there.  The only other comet assay results from benthic fish (the Cuyahoga River and Old Woman Creek at Lake Erie and three ponds in Cape Cod) are at OSURF.  Therefore, statistical comparisons among different locations can only be performed at OSURF by students actively involved in the ongoing research.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The anticipated award date is 3/21/2003.  NAICS is 541710 and SIC is 8732.

This requirement shall be awarded based on other than full and open competition, as cited under FAR 6.302.

The achievement of management, technical and quality goals will be the basis of evaluation of performance under the contract.  CPR reporting will be used to measure contractor performance. 	The contract to Raytheon will be a CPAF contract for development, flight test rounds, and flight test support of the SM-3 component of Aegis BMD Blocks 2004, 2006, 2008 and Japan Cooperative Research.  The Award Fee boards will consist of the Program Manager, respective branch head, the Procuring Contracting Officer and various field activities approved by the Fee Determining Official.  All major systems development contracts will have on-site Government technical representatives (TECHREPs).  NAVSEA 02 and the DCMA Administrative Contracting Officer will execute contract administration. The proposed allocation of RDT&E funds for this contract modifica tion is consistent with RDT&E appropriation incremental funding policies.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional indexing services on a sole source basis from BIREME - Centro Latino-Americano e do Caribe de Informacao en Ciencias de la Salud, Organizacion Panamericana de la Salud (PAHO) for a continuation of existing services for on-line indexing services using NLM's web-based indexing system.  The Index Section of the National Library of Medicine is responsible for the indexing of life science journals for Index Medicus and MEDLINE.  Since the 1980s indexing has been obtained for certain Spanish and Portuguese language journals published in South America from the international MEDLARS partner, BIREME, PAHO in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  The indexing policies and procedures used at NLM are given in the NLM Indexing Manual, supplemented by technical memoranda and other indexing aids.  The major effort  required by indexing is the analysis of journal articles for subject matter and the application of appropriate subject headings, drawn from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), NLM's controlled vocabulary.  Indexers will use NLM's web-based online indexing system to add subject headings to the online record for each article.  Indexers will access the online record for each article and review the descriptive data that has been provided for each one (pagination, language, authors, author affiliation and title). Indexers will provide translations for the titles, which are not published in English.  The online indexing system contains many validation programs to detect real or potential errors.  Indexers will respond to "Error" or "Warning" messages generated by the system.  NLM will provide access to the NLM Indexing Manual, MeSH and standard NLM-generated indexing aids.  Some of these may be available in electronic format on the Web; when they are available in print format, NLM will provide sufficient quantities for each indexer.  NLM will supply URLs and necessary passwords to access Web-based journals.  BIREME will subscribe to an agreed-upon list of journals published in South America.  NLM will provide access to the online indexing system, seven days a week and almost 24 hours per day.  Occasionally weekend availability will be interrupted for scheduled maintenance to the NLM computer system.  NLM will notify the indexing center as soon as journal issues have had descriptive information entered into the online indexing system.  Indexing services will be provided at the rate of approximately 175 articles per month, or 2,100 articles for the twelve (12) months period.  The period of performance is anticipated for a period of twelve (12) months with two (2) one-year option periods.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide professional services as stated above.  Responses should sufficiently demonstrate the firm's ability to meet the government's requirements.  Responses are required within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. NLM-03-092-UHP.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Uyen H.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command proposes award a sole source contract to Gulfstream Aerospace, Incorporated.  This proposed procurement will provide the Program Manager Air 207 (PMA-207), with Contractor Logistics Services in support of one each C-20A aircraft. The contract will be a one-year plus two 3-month option periods with a performance period of 1 April 2003 through 30 September 2004.  Gulfstream Aerospace Incorporated will provide manpower and other resources to accomplish tasks peculiar to the C-20A aircraft including:

a.	Perform site preparation and stand-up in Capodachino, Italy.

b.	Provide all labor and material to operate and maintain a Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) and provide Contractor Logistics Support consisting of Management of component/engine program, contractor acquired replacement parts, spares acquisition, program support, support equipment and technical support services for the C-20A aircraft assigned to Capodachino, Italy.

c.	Perform emergency depot services and routine depot services as required.

Gulfstream Aerospace Incorporated is the original designer and manufacturer for the C-20 series aircraft, tooling, and unique support equipment.  Gulfstream is the only complete source of historical, development, design, manufacturing, modifications, test and flight certification data for the aircraft. The aircraft were procured as "off the shelf" FAA certified commercial derivative aircraft with Gulfstream retaining proprietary rights to technical data.  The Government does not currently possess sufficient in-house expertise or peculiar support equipment to perform the required tasks for these aircraft. Continual access to proprietary data is essential for the satisfactory accomplishment of required services.  This contract is intended as a one-time acquisition to provide interim support for this single C-20A aircraft.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>PMS 452 intends to continue its acquisition strategy of awarding the continued development of the STANDARD Missile-3 portion of the AEGIS BMD System to Raytheon Company. This requirement shall be awarded based on other than full and open competition, as cited under FAR 6.302.  Award to, and thus an introduction of, a different contractor would introduce delays in the Navy's ability to develop this capability to meet the established requirements.  Raytheon is the only contractor with the engineering background and technical expertise capable of performing in a cost effective manner within an acceptable time frame as cited under FAR 6.302-1.
The procurement to Raytheon will be CPAF. The award fee structure will evaluate performance as it relates to meeting defined technical, schedule and cost effectiveness.
Technical management aspects of the program will be accomplished through a series of schedule program reviews.  The achievement of management, technical and quality goals will be the basis of evaluation of performance under the contract.  CPR reporting will be used to measure contractor performance.
	The contract to Raytheon will be a CPAF contract for development, flight test rounds, and flight test support of the SM-3 component of Aegis BMD Blocks 2004, 2006, 2008 and Japan Cooperative Research.  The Award Fee boards will consist of the Program Manager, respective branch head, the Procuring Contracting Officer and various field activities approved by the Fee Determining Official.  All major systems development contracts will have on-site Government technical representatives (TECHREPs).  NAVSEA 02 and the DCMA Administrative Contracting Officer will execute contract administration.
The proposed allocation of RDT&E funds for this contract modification is consistent with RDT&E appropriation incremental funding policies.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Spectra-Physics, Mt. View, CA, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Only One Source Reasonably Available, for renewal of maintenance agreements billed quarterly in arrears for two (2) laser systems.  Specifically:  1) gold on-site f/Model 2085-20/4.0S (S/N 244) system; 2) gold on-site modified f/Model 2045-15/4.0S (S/N 139) Plasma Tube and Laser Head only; and, 3) gold on-site modified f/Model 2045-20/3.0 (S/N 407). Coverage includes parts (excluding consumables), labor (to achieve proper specs) and travel for each of the two (2) units. This is a sole source procurement as Spectra-Physics is the OEM manufacturer of the systems and is the only source with factory-certified trained service technicians available to keep the equipment operational and at peak capacity; and, can provide parts from a large inventory of stock immediately to avoid unnecessary downtime.  A fixed price Purchase Order will be issued on or about March 25, 2003 with a performance period of April 1, 2003 through March 31, 2004. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 811219 and the size standard is $6.0 mil.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing.  This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, the Government will consider all responses received by the closing date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) is not available.  See Note 26. NOTICE HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO ADD A THIRD LASER SYSTEM.

<DESC>In lieu of answering specific technical questions submitted with respect to our proposed sole-source procurement, we offer instead an explanation of the reason we believe this requirement is available from only the proposed contractor:  In 2002, the Federal Reserve Bank System (FRB) contracted with Southwestern Bell Communications (SBC) to provide management of their entire Local Area Network (LAN) and their Wide Area Network (WAN). SBC sub-contracted with Intermedia Communications Inc  (ICI) to provide the WAN connectivity. Prior to awarding the contract to SBC and its subcontractor, the FRB did a complete Security Review of both companies. The resulting LAN and WAN are now part of the FRBs network, they are secure and encrypted, and they are used exclusively for FRB telecommunications traffic.  Included in this private network is the wide area ATM cloud provided by ICI.  BPD requires connectivity to the FRBs private ATM cloud for its Parkersburg, WV, location and its Washington, DC, location.  To establish the connectivity into the private FRB internal network, BPD must utilize ICI for the WAN connectivity, because ICI is providing the FRB's ATM cloud. The FRB indicates to BPD that they will not grant access to their private ATM cloud to any other telecommunications provider.  In order for another telecommunications provider to make an affirmative response, their response shall include a showing that they can obtain permission from the FRB to connect to the FRB's private ATM cloud.  The due date for affirmative responses is hereby extended to close of business March 27, 2003.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Subject to final approval, the Bureau of the Public Debt intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to Intermedia Communications, Inc., One Intermedia Way, FLT-TR2, Tampa, FL  33647, for dedicated end-to-end secure video teleconference services from two Public Debt facilities in Washington, DC, and Parkersburg, WV, to the Federal Reserve Banks through the existing Federal Reserve Video Conference Network currently operated by Intermedia Communications, Inc., at an information Rate of 768kbs.  The service at each BPD location shall consist of the following:  End-to End encryption of information streams, compatible with the existing FRB VC Network encryption; The contractor shall from a central site the security and configuration of the government-provided 2621 Cisco Router at each BPD site; One (1) DS1 UNI CKT (digital service 1 user to network interface circuit); One (1) VBRRT VC @ 768 (variable bit rate real time video conference circuit at 768 kb); and, One (1) Disaster Recovery BBRRT VC @ 768 (bit rate real time video conference circuit at 768 kb).   No solicitation document is available.  Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than February 27, 2003, from other firms who believe they can provide this service.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to comply with the above requirements.  Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, we will make a sole-source award to Intermedia Communications, Inc.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to add an eighth topic to this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for High Altitude Airship technologies, including platforms designs, subsystems, components and payloads. The BAA description is revised to read as follows:  

The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend the United States and its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack.  As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capability or improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats.  To investigate these new technologies, MDA has established a Deputy for Advanced Systems (AS) whose mission is to pursue and assess innovative concepts and develop algorithms to improve BMDS capability.  MDA/AS has established an Innovation Cell, which consists of a team of experts to evaluate new ballistic missile defense concepts and technologies.  The MDA/AS Innovation Cell seeks new and innovative concepts for integrated systems and for technical improvements in the boost, midcourse, and terminal phases of missile defense.  Specific research objectives for each missile defense phase encompass Surveillance, Track & Discrimination, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, and Kill Assessment.  Concepts are sought in the following eight technology areas: (1) Radar Systems, including Integrated System Concepts, Cross Sections and Signatures, Measurements (waveforms, data extraction), Hardware (transmit/receive modules), Signal Processing, Data Visualization, Data Compression, Image Interpretation, Seekers; (2) Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems, including High Energy Lasers, Beam Control, Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar Systems, Optical Signal Processing, Focal Plane Arrays, Lethality Mechanisms; (3) Mathematics and Computer Science, including Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Software, Probability and Statistics, and Pattern Recognition; (4) Electrical Engineering, including Digital Electronics and Signal Processing, Machine Implementation of Algorithms, Analog Circuits and Communications, Computer Vision, Distributed Computing; (5) Physics and Chemistry, including Electrodynamics, Nuclear Physics and Weapons Effects, Infrared and Optical Signatures, Energy Conversion, and Rocket Plume Analysis; (6) Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, including Space Systems, Missile System Aerodynamics, Propulsion, and Reentry Physics, Guidance and Control, and Materials Science; (7) Battle Management/Command and Control, including Engagement Planning, Tactics, Intelligence Exploitation, and Countermeasures, Decision Theory and Modeling, Target Tracking, Classification, Identification, and Discrimination, and Sensor Fusion; and (8) High Altitude Airship, including platform designs, subsystems, components, and payloads.  

If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary concept paper (requested limit of five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program; (2) a Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities.  Offerors, which have been certified as a Small Business Concern, should indicate that status on their submittal.  Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .pdf file) to the point of contact listed below.  

MDA will evaluate these responses based upon the following criteria (all criteria of equal importance): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include the maturity of the technology and the level of risk; (2) the scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; (3) the offers capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (ROCM).  Offerors are reminded that a BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35.016).  White Papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA will remain open until September 30, 2003. Responses will be evaluated as received, but may take up to six months to complete.  If MDA decides to pursue a concept, a formal proposal will be requested.  The MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in FYs 2002  2004, and will most likely be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type of arrangement.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  The point of contact for concept submittals and questions is Richard Baumgartner at (703) 695-9086 or email at Richard.Baumgartner@mda.osd.mil.

<CONTACT>Jeannette Jordan, 703-697-1274
<DESC>NA THIS IS A PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND A CALL FOR PROPOSALS.  OSD Defense Challenge Program has been established to provide opportunities for the increased introduction of innovative and cost-saving technology or product into existing Department of Defense (DOD ) acquisition programs. The Defense Challenge program provides any person or activity within or outside the DOD the opportunity to propose alternatives, to be known as Challenge Proposals, at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DOD acq uisition program that would result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program. Challenge Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b De fense Acquisition Challenge Program.  This BAA is open to any product or technology that demonstrates a near-term (6-12 months after project inception) potential for improvements in existing DoD acquisition programs.   The evaluation of Challenge Proposals  will be conducted in two phases: (1) In the FIRST PHASE, companies interested in participating will submit a document called a Summary Challenge Proposal. A Summary Proposal is a three- to five-page abstract or summary of the proposed project and a Quad C hart.  The proposal will include a description of the product or technology to be evaluated, a summary of its capabilities, and a cost estimate for test article acquisition.  The synopsis must identify the DoD acquisition program proposed for incorporating  the product/technology and describe the potential benefit to the program of inserting the product/technology.  The submittal must include a letter of interest from the DoD Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the program.  All Summary Proposals received will be subjected to peer and scientific review. The submittal of a Summary Proposal and Quad Chart is designed to preclude companies from incurring the effort and expense of preparing full technical and cost proposals, for projects having little chance of being funded. (2) In the SECOND PHASE, companies submitting a Summary Challenge Proposal & Quad Chart that show the most promise will be issued an invitation to work with a DoD sponsor to submit a complete technical and cos t Final Challenge Proposal and Quad Chart for the planned project.  The Final Challenge Proposal will include: key performance parameters (those the product must meet); test concept and schedule for the test planning, conduct, and data analysis, a plan for  integration (to include cost and schedule) of the product into the acquisition program; cost for test article acquisition or lease; a cost profile for the test and evaluation of product or technology for the intended application.  The integration plan mus t include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology into the acquisition program.  During this second phase a Government-led evaluation team will re view all Final Challenge Proposals, and evaluate and rate each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b. All final proposals will be reviewed by the prime system contractor carrying out the acquisition program.  Proposals wi ll be selected for funding, based on a source selection assessment and the availability of Government funding.  Criteria for project selection at the Summary Proposal Phase are: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to resu lt in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at an a cceptable cost, and without unacceptable disruption to the acquisition program. The Government review of the Challenge Proposals at the final stage will include  all criteria listed above and will include: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with th e challenge proposal. The number of projects and the final dollar value of each project will depend on the total funds available.  There is a total of approximately $12 million available for all FY2003 projects.  Information and Summary Proposal submittal is available at www.bids.acqcenter.com/dacp .  This website has further information on the Quad Chart, Summary Challenge Proposal format, Final Challenge Proposal format, submission instructions, and other information as required.  Summary Challenge Propos als must be received not later than 1500 hours local time (3:00PM EST) on 1 April 2003 (based on a 15 March release of BAA, to be open for 15 days).  Proposals will be evaluated on a first-come-first-served basis.  This announcement must not be construed a s a commitment by the Government and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request f or Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NASA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this information, but may release a solicitation at a later date based on the need for this type of technology and its feasibility based upon the responses to this Request for Information (RFI).  However, NASA expects that responses to this RFI will initiate discussions about the mutual benefit of partnering and, if NASA and the responder agree that a partnership is in the best interest of both parties, an appropriate document such as a non-funded agreement may be considered.  You are invited to submit the requested information to the identified technical point of contact, no later than April 11, 2002.	In responding, refer to "RFI-03-PAV". NASA is performing preliminary design studies of Personal Air Vehicle (PAV) missions, concepts, and technologies for the purpose of augmenting on-demand personal transportation mobility and capacity.  The intent of this research is to perform the analysis and demonstration required to provide radical improvements to the key metrics that currently inhibit market growth of these vehicles.   Initial research efforts will focus on the near-term, next generation General Aviation class of vehicles, with follow-on efforts performing investigations on mid-term and long-term mission concepts.  This PAV research will include focused efforts in the following areas, with the following research goals.   1)   Reducing small aircraft community noise by 30 PNLdb at a 500' sideline measurement, equating to a ten-fold reduction in the perceived noise so that these aircraft are no noisier than current motorcycle regulations.  The intent of this effort is to demonstrate that significant increases in small aircraft operations can be acceptable to communities, as these vehicles are designed with technologies that permit them to be good neighbors. 2)	   Reducing the aircraft acquisition cost on the order of 60% from current price levels while still at relatively modest production volumes.  This effort will include investigation of advanced quality assurance certification processes and procedures, instead of the current quality control methods.  Significant industry investment has not occurred because a sizable market is not envisioned at cost levels where only a small fraction of the population can enter the market..  Future production of such vehicles could be on the scale of limited production luxury cars, however the demonstration of affordable vehicles at relatively low volume is a critical step for market growth that would provide the capital for rapid expansion.  3)    Simplify the operation of small aircraft such that the specialized skills, knowledge and associated training are reduced to levels comparable to operating an automobile or boat.  This reduction must be achieved during near-all-weather operations and with a level of safety that is superior to comparable operations today. Mid-term and long-term efforts could also include investigation of technologies that provide improved performance and short field length takeoff and landing capability.  Implicit to all these investigations will be enhancing the vehicle safety, versatility, ease of entry, interior environment, visibility, and maintenance and operations cost.  Information is desired on current research efforts in these focused areas for respondent's interested in partnering with NASA on collaborative investigation. Information should include related research experience, a capability statement, as well as specific proposed technologies and approaches. Any proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately and will be handled accordingly.	Please provide the name of a business and technical point of contact for your organization or company along with their phone number, e-mail address and mailing address. Responses should be prepared using MS Word using the following format. Font = Arial, Font size = 10 pt, Page limit = 10 pages, Margins = 1 inch.  Responses should be submitted to the technical point of contact, Mark Moore at m.d.moore@larc.nasa.gov  Questions concerning technical details of this effort should be addressed to Mark Moore at 757-864-2262 or the above e-mail address.   This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review and responses to this RFI will not be returned.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-M67854-03-I-3088
<RESPDATE>040303

<DESC>The following Request for Information is issued for the purposes of updating market research and encouraging commercial companies to provide information on chemical/biological (CB) protective overboots.  This request is in support of the Marine Corps Systems Commands (MARCORSYSCOM) ALTERNATIVE FOOTWEAR SOLUTIONS (AFS) project.  The AFS project, a subset of the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) program, goal is to determine the availability or potential development of a chemical/biological (CB) protective overboot that requires less volume/package space than the overboots currently in use by the Joint Services, and that can also be manufactured for proper fit over the joint services boot population with significantly fewer sizes than overboots in the current inventory.  In other words, one size of an overboot should fit properly, without being bulky or too small, over a range of service-boot sizes. The development of an overboot that requires less volume is necessary to lighten the carrying weight and placement burdens on the individual warfighter, as well as to improve/lessen the overall storage and transportation requirements of CB overboots.  A minimal number of overboot sizes that still ensure proper fit is necessary:  (1) to improve the efficiency of the logistics actions necessary to ship, store, maintain and replace CB overboots, and (2) to enable more efficient vendor production and distribution costs which will result in lower costs to the Joint Services.  Requirements of the desired less volume/package space overboot with fewer sizes follow.  The footwear must:  (A) Provide 24 hours of protection while exposed to a liquid challenge of 10gm/m2 (HG,TGD,VX) or a  vapor/aerosol challenge of 5,000ct (HG,TGD,VX).  (B) Provide the same protection level identified in (A) even after 45 days of wear that did not involve exposure to CB challenges.  (C) Meet or closely approach the desired footwear volume/package space of less than 0.105 cubic feet.  (D) Be compatible with combat footwear of the Joint Services, fitting, at a minimum, the middle 90-percent of the range of combined womens and mens sizes placed in order of smallest to largestin other words, overboot sizes are not required to fit 5 percent of each tail in the range (one tail being the smallest womens sizes and the other being the largest mens sizes); however, to fit the stipulated 90-percent range, a total of no more than four overboot sizes would be preferable.  (E) Have a shelf life of at least 5 years, but preferably 10 years.  (F) Be of sufficient height to interface with the accompanying protective overgarments.  (G) Provide improved traction over the existing Green Vinyl Overboot, the Black Vinyl Overboot, and the Chemical Protective Footwear Cover.  (H) Contain a non-snagging closure system.  (I) Be mildew, fungus, petroleum, oil, lubricant and saltwater resistant.  (J) Not degrade mission performance.  (K) Be able to be donned/doffed while wearing CB gloves, mask and overgarment.  (L) Be capable of being decontaminated to an operationally safe level.  Vendors capable of providing viable solutions are invited to submit responses to this notice to the Marine Corps Systems Command CTQ3DBR, ATTN: Doris Ragsdale, 3041A McCawley Avenue, Quantico, VA 22134 by COB 3 April 2003.  Telephonic responses will not be accepted.  Responses should include three copies of documentation that supports this determination.  If products capable of meeting these anticipated requirements are already available, vendors are encouraged to provide two pair of their overboots as representative samples along with their written documentation.  The information submitted may be used in the preparation of subsequent requests for proposals; however, no solicitation exists at this time.  The publication of this request or subsequent submission of product information shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government for vendors to procure equipment or to take any other action regarding this request for footwear information.  Firms should refer questions to the Contract Specialist, Doris Ragsdale, at (703) 432-3271 or ragsdaledb@mcsc.usmc.mil.  All information submitted by each firm will be treated as proprietary, but will be shared with MKI Systems, Sverdrup, and Battelle following receipt of a non-disclosure agreement from each of these three companies.  The Government does not intend to pay for or otherwise reimburse for information submitted in response to this notice.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a custom cryostat to be manufactured that will be able to reach temperatures of below 10mK and allow many, of order 300 to 2000, electrical wires to be connected to an experiment.  In order to meet these requirements, the cryostat is of a custom design and has to be manufactured identically to the design given by our specifications and must be completely manufactured by July 31, 2003.  The dilution refrigerator unit is being procured separately and will be installed and tested by NIST.  These specifications are for the main cryostat and its interior vacuum connections to the dilution refrigerator. The construction of the cryostat will proceed in two stages.  In stage I, the main cryostat with the liquid nitrogen and liquid helium tanks, as well as their supports and radiation shields, will be built.  This cryostat will then be transported to the NIST Boulder site to be tested for cryogen consumption rates.  These rates will be measured both before and after the main vacuum container is gold plated.  In stage II, fabrication of parts will include a still pumping line, a 1K pot system and return line, a precooler line, and the thermal and mechanical supports for the dilution refrigerator.   The contractor will be responsible for the transportation of the cryostat to and from the NIST facility.  The custom nature of this system will require close communications between Dr. John Martinis, the physicist heading this project, and the manufacturer.  We require that a meeting to be held every two weeks between the manufacturer and a NIST representative to check the status of the project and to check on details of the manufacturing and assembly process.  Stage I components will include a wooden support structure, a stainless steel (SS) top plate flange, a SS vacuum vessel with pump-out ports and a gold-plated inside surface, a 77K cryogen tank, a 4K cryogen tank, thermal supports made from G10, Al tank flanges for the two cryogen tanks, and infrared shields made from Al.  The cryostat will have 12 insert ports to allow NIST to add other subsystems for the dilution refrigerator and custom electrical feedthroughs.  The various parts here and for the Stage II parts must be manufactured with sufficient tolerances so that the parts do not have to be custom fitted to the rest of the cryostat.  The surfaces and materials of the cryostat must be chosen such that the cryostat provides electrical shielding (as a Faraday cage) around the experimental spaces.  Stress modeling of the vacuum vessel must also be undertaken.  The cryogen vessel and its fill tube must be made entirely out of stainless steel and welded stainless steel connections to maximize the reliability of the cryostat from leaks.  Stage II components will include a 1K thermal ring, a still flange, a cold plate flange, a mixing chamber flange, access hole covers, thermal supports, thermal connections to the dilution refrigerator, radiation shields, a still insert, a still connection tee, a precooler insert, and a 1K pot and return line insert.  These components will be manufactured to be compatible with ultra-low temperature operation.  The 1K pot insert will contain both welded SS and brazed parts.  Documentation of the fabrication and assembly of the instrument shall be included.  Machine-shop drawings of the various pieces will be used to document the instrument as well check its design by NIST staff before construction.  A list of the suppliers and any specialty machine shops that are used for the fabrication of parts shall be supplied.  Assembly or welding instructions shall be provided, as appropriate.  Written specifications will be provided in a separate package upon request.  More detailed specifications are also given by three-dimensional computer-generated design files in "SolidWorks" and cross sections in a pdf format. Evaluation Criteria as follows:  Both price and technical content will be used to evaluate the proposals.  Because of the critical nature of this piece of equipment to the success of the quantum computing effort, technical merit will be weighted more heavily in the final decision, with price assuming increased importance in the differentiation between closely ranked technical proposals.  Technical merit will be evaluated by a team of three NIST scientists based on the following 3 criteria, each weighted by 33.3%: 1) Ability of manufacturer to construct scientific instruments.  Performance will be evaluated on past experience with constructing scientific instruments, especially those involving cryogenic design and fabrication methods, electromagnetic shielding, and low vibrational noise.  2) Construction techniques and ability.  Performance will be evaluated on construction techniques of the various components, judged by manufacturing techniques and the ability of the processes to hold mechanical tolerances for interchangeable components, produce reliable weld joints, and give low infrared-radiation emissivity surfaces.  3) Ability of manufacturer to communicate and collaborate with NIST.  Performance will be evaluated base on the ability of the manufacturer to communicate easily and often with NIST in order to assure proper final design and manufacturing, and to ensure that all components fit together as a cryostat system and be compatible with the dilution refrigerator unit.  Since testing is required at the NIST facility to ensure compatibility with other electronic and vacuum systems, easy transportation of the instrument to and from NIST is desirable.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This requirement is set-aside for small business unless small business cannot meet the Governments need at a reasonable cost.  Technical merit, as well as price, will be considered in selecting a vendor. Technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by fax or by email.  You may submit your proposal by fax or by mail.   Proposal must be received on or before close of business April 1, 2003.  Please include delivery date, F.O.B. point, business size, Federal Taxpayer Identification Number, and Dun and Bradstreet Number.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be fond on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE.  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date April 3, 2003.

52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of price and past performance.  Past performance will be considered equally important as price.  The offeror shall submit, as part of its proposal, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.

Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the proposal of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the responses of other offerors.

52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items;

Take note of the following stipulation:

PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERCENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (MAY 1999)
 
(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term EFT refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
 
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--
 
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
 
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
 
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.
 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.
 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
 
(e) Contractor EFT arrangements. If the Contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the Contractor has not notified the Government of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the Government shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database.
 
(f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--
 
(i) Making a correct payment;
 
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
 
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
 
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
 
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
 
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
 
(g) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
 
(h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
 
(i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.
 
(j) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.
 
(End)

F.O.B. DESTINATION (Nov 1991)
(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this statement, means --
(1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and
(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.
(b) The Contractor shall --
(1)
(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or
(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;
(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;

Take note of the following stipulation:

PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERCENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (MAY 1999)
 
(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term EFT refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
 
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--
 
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
 
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
 
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.
 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.
 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
 
(e) Contractor EFT arrangements. If the Contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the Contractor has not notified the Government of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the Government shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database.
 
(f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--
 
(i) Making a correct payment;
 
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
 
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
 
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
 
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
 
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
 
(g) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
 
(h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
 
(i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.
 
(j) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.
 
(End)

F.O.B. DESTINATION (Nov 1991)
(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this statement, means --
(1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and
(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.
(b) The Contractor shall --
(1)
(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or
(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;
(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;
(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;
(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;
