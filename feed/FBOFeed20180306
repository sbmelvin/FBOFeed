Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.   
Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.   
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets Qualification Requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The Government is NOT required to delay contract award to review a pending Source Approval Request (SAR).  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit SARs AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  If the Government has not completed review of a SAR when the contract is awarded the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible source approval for future awards.   
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to contact the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.   

First Article (FA) testing is required for this requirement. However, FA testing is waived for the OEM and offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same articles for the Government (provided not more than 36 months have elapsed since completion of the contract and articles thus furnished have exhibited satisfactory performance in service in the opinion of the Government). If an offeror(s) is interested in becoming qualified, solicitation SPRTA1-17-R-0505 will be amended to add FA testing line items and revise sections L & M for evaluation of offerors.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download on the release date only from www.fbo.gov.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to Nathan Sholund at (405) 739-4382 or email at nathan.sholund@us.af.mil

In accordance with the authority of FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The estimated quantities will fulfill requirements for various Department of Defense (DoD) customers over approximately five years. ACC-WRN intends to award these requirements via a Requirements contract as defined by FAR 16.503.
<p>The Government estimates it will order approximately 300 vehicles for DoD requirements over the next five years. However, this is an estimate only in accordance with FAR 16.503(a)(1). The above estimates are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that the estimated quantity will actually be required or ordered. All vehicle and kits will be ordered pursuant to FAR 16.505 Ordering.</p>
<p>AM General is the only known qualified source for this procurement as the Government does not currently have a competitive Technical Data Package (TDP), which is required to manufacture the following HMMWV ECV variants, which may be procured by the Government in this action:</p>
<p>M1151A1, NSN: 2320-01-540-2038<br />M1151A1B1, NSN: 2320-01-540-2038<br />M1152A1, NSN: 2320-01-540-2007<br />M1152A1B2, NSN: 2320-01-540-2007 <br />M1165A1, NSN: 2320-01-540-2017 <br />M1165A1B3, NSN: 2320-01-540-2017 <br />M1167, NSN: 2320-01-544-9638</p>
<p>The variants include an updated armor package, air conditioning system, and Reliability Enhancement Vehicle (REV) components that improve engine cooling and vehicle suspension for increased vehicle reliability and performance. These integrated upgrades are proprietary to AM General.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is 336992. The inspection/acceptance and FOB points are Origin.</p>
<p>Although it is the Government's intent to solicit and negotiate with only one source as authorized by FAR 6.302-1, AM General, LLC (Cage Code 0H3G6), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>This is a pre-solicitation notice, otherwise known as a synopsis. The solicitation pertaining to this notice will not be available for a minimum of 15 days from the date of this notice. Contractors should not call the buyer or procuring contracting officer seeking a copy of the solicitation (or other data) as none will be available until the solicitation is issued. No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT.

The purpose of this sources sought announcement is for market research to make an appropriate acquisition decision and to gain knowledge of potential qualified businesses interested and capable of providing the services described below. Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.

Background
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages nearly 450 million acres of land (surface) in fourteen western states (California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona and Wyoming). The BLM mandates land health monitoring to document effectiveness of the decisions established in Resource Management Plans, to determine treatment effectiveness, or for habitat evaluation, among others. The Assessment, Inventory and Monitoring (AIM) strategy is the approved monitoring strategy for terrestrial and lentic monitoring. Several thousand points are monitored each year. The core and contingent or supplemental methods are described in AIM monitoring manuals and on the website aim.landscapetoolbox.org. The lentic protocol is forthcoming, however will be similar to the upland protocol.

AIM methods and data collection span various habitats. BLM lands include uplands, aquatic/riparian areas, and wetlands/lentic areas, and AIM monitoring occurs in all of these land types. AIM information is used to inform Land Use Plan Effectiveness evaluations, livestock grazing permit renewals, reclamation or restoration efforts, and habitat assessments (including for Greater Sage-Grouse), among others.

Scope
BLM requires the collection of data from up to 10,000 terrestrial and lentic field plots per year at full implementation, although current workload is approximately 3,000 plots per year, across the above-listed land types and states. Data collected will include AIM core and supplemental indicators. Work is often in remote areas and will require preliminary site scouting in collaboration with local field offices. BLM requires field data collected following strict, established field protocols, QA/QC procedures, and data upload according to requirements. The contractor must be willing to work with the local field offices, meet educational requirements, collect data during the appropriate seasonal requirements, and provide all the tools necessary to complete the monitoring task. BLM requires that the outcome of each plot be tracked and submitted to BLM.

All field personnel shall attend mandatory AIM methods trainings and must use established, rigorous QA/QC protocols.  Data shall be delivered to the local field office at the completion of each data collection period (e.g. hitch). 

Work in AK often requires helicopter access.

BLM is also requesting assistance with training support and monitoring coordination.   For some field offices, support may be needed throughout the year to complete pre-season and post-season work including plot reconnaissance, data QA/QC and compilation, and basic reporting functions.

This sources sought shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the contractor submission of this sources sought or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this request.  No contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement.  Data submitted in response to this request will not be returned.

The North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541620-Environmental Consulting Services ($15.0M).

INSTRUCTION FOR SOURCES SOUGHT SUBMISSION:
After review of this requirement, interested parties may submit a response in an electronic format only via email to jchamberlin@blm.gov no later than 27 March 2018 2:00PM MT. Electronic files shall be in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat PDF format.

<p>There are currently CDC programs using pharmacy data through contracts with IQVIA but not including access to this new IQVIA e360 platform that offers complex data and tools. A pilot project, short-term access for a limited number of CDC scientists, will allow CDC scientists to become familiar with the data and tools provided on IQVIA e360 and explore its value for public health that will inform future decisions on its potential use across the agency through long-term acquisition of direct access.</p>
<p>Participating in this pilot project and having direct access to this unique e360 platform that offers RWE datasets and complex applications, CDC scientists will be poised to conduct complex analysis and develop use cases on disease patterns, progression, and health outcomes; evaluate clinical guidelines uptake, treatments and interventions; and conduct public health surveillance type queries. These use cases will address a range of HHS, CDC, and programmatic priorities, such as opioids abuse, mental health, hypertension, diabetes, healthcare-associated infections, and many other chronic and infectious conditions. Study findings will inform public health programs and surveillance strategies on the importance of using clinical, claims, laboratory and pharmacy data on the same platform as the integration of public health and health care continues to evolve at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>A.	The National Park Service and Gateway National Recreation Area<br /> <br />1. The National Park Service and its Mission:<br /> America's National Park Service was created by Congress to "conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such a manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." Additionally, Congress declared the National Park System should be, "...preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all the people of the United States." The National Park Service (NPS) has as its overall mission the preservation and public enjoyment of significant aspects of the nation's natural and cultural heritage.
<p>54 U.S.C. 102102 (formerly 16 U.S.C. 1a-2(k)) allows the NPS to lease certain federally owned or administered property located within the boundaries of park areas. The leasing process is regulated pursuant to 36 CFR 18.</p>
<p>To learn more about the NPS, visit our website at www.nps.gov. This site includes information about who we are, our mission, NPS policies, and individual parks.<br /> <br />2. Gateway National Recreation Area:<br />Gateway National Recreation Area (Gateway) was established in 1972 as the nation's first urban National Park. Gateway is comprised of three park Units in two states - the Jamaica Bay and Staten Island Units in New York, and the Sandy Hook Unit in New Jersey. The facilities offered in this Request for Bid (RFB) are located in the Sandy Hook beach plazas. <br /> <br />3. Sandy Hook Unit:<br />Sandy Hook is located at the northern end of the New Jersey shore, accessible via Route 36 in Monmouth County. Sandy Hook is situated at the southern entrance of Lower New York Bay. The approximate 7-mile stretch of spectacular ocean and bay waters make Sandy Hook a favorite Jersey Shore getaway for Garden State residents and others. Manhattanites also enjoy Sandy Hook beaches and recreation due to the convenience of a 45-minute ferry ride from the Wall Street area and 35th Street to the Fort Hancock Historic Post at Sandy Hook, at which large scale revitalization efforts are underway. More information about Fort Hancock can be found here www.nps.gov/gate. For additional leasing opportunities please visit https://forthancock21.org.</p>
<p>In 2016, Sandy Hook was a destination for over two million visitors. Historic annual visitation figures are public and available to review here https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park. Sandy hook offers additional special events throughout the season. The Sandy Hook Wednesday Night Concert series is a free weekly event featuring live entertainment hosted by the Sandy Hook Foundation. There are several other special permitted events such as marathons, bike races, and cooperator run events throughout the season. Standard amenities at beach locations include public bathrooms, showers, and vending machines.</p>
<p>In October 2012, Superstorm Sandy devastated the region and the Sandy Hook area suffered some of the most severe damage. Water engulfed properties and destroyed homes and other structures, and caused significant damage to a number of NPS buildings. Due to the significant damage to permanent structures and desire to provide a resilient approach to visitor services, the NPS is seeking to utilize mobile or movable operations.</p>
<p>B.

Video Inspection of a National Park Service owned fuel barge by a contracted diving team per Statement of Work (SOW) provided, for North Cascades National Park Service Complex (NOCA). This Request for Quotations has been made available through electronic commerce to comply with the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(e)) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 416). NPS routinely posts RFQ's with expected value between $15,000 and $25,000 at the federal government point of entry.

1. Background and Location: The objective of this work is to assist the National Park Service (NPS) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in performing a complete exterior hull inspection (video inspection) of an NPS-owned fuel storage barge. The inspection requires coordination of multiple parties: the National Park Service, the US Coast Guard, Ross Lake Resort (RLR), fuel vendor and Seattle City Light. The Col is a steel-hulled fuel barge built in 1998 by Modutech Marine of Tacoma WA. It has a steel hull 37'ft. 6"in. long with 12'ft. beam and 4'ft. 6"in. draft. It is used to store unleaded gas and diesel fuel for use by NPS, RLR, and the visiting public on Ross Lake. This inspection is performed at five year intervals and the last time it was completed was 2013.
The fuel barge is usually docked at the Ross Lake Resort in Ross Lake National Recreation Area. Ross Lake Resort is a remote facility at the south end of Ross Lake, approximately 12 miles east of Newhalem, Washington. There are no roads to the site. To get to Ross Lake Resort, cross Diablo Lake by boat or barge, then travel by truck or foot along the haul road from the bottom of Ross Dam to Ross Lake (3/4 mile). The Col will be moved and moored at the end of the haul road for this inspection, attached to a small dock 15-25 feet from shore, and approximately 10 feet deep, but that depends on lake level as well. NPS has scheduled and will pay for barge runs across Diablo Lake for the contracted parties' equipment, truck, and personnel.
The nearest lodging and meals available are in Marblemount, WA. The nearest backcountry camping is available at Green Point on Ross Lake; car camping is available at Diablo Lake or Colonial Creek campgrounds on Diablo Lake. Information about and maps of Ross Lake can be viewed at www.nps.gov/noca.
Due to the remoteness of the site and logistics costs involved with transportation, lodging, meals etc., interested quoters are advised to thoroughly research the site prior to submitting a quote!
Please view information in the attached solicitation documents: 1) [Sol_140P8318Q0032.pdf]; 2) [140P8318Q0032_ Attach 01_Photos of Fuel Barge.pdf] and 3) [140P8318Q0032_Attach 02_Wage Determination_WD 04-0047.pdf] for RFQ specifications, detailed information & clauses and if interested provide quote as indicated.
Questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing to Ron_Forsberg@nps.gov. Answers will be provided in writing to the requester (if the answer is already within the RFQ) or provided in amendment(s) to the solicitation (RFQ). Amendments to this solicitation will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities at https://www.FBO.gov search document number: 140P8318Q0032. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid.  The intent of this synopsis is to make notice of a proposed contract action for a Design-Bid-Build (DBB) construction project for the DD#2 Main Dewatering Pump Replacement and Facility Repairs located at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
This contract is for design-bid-build (DBB) construction services to replace facility essential / mission critical dewatering pumps, essential for Dry Dock certification, in Dry Dock 2, restoring reliability and reducing risk for docking/undocking of submarines undergoing maintenance, overhaul and reactor servicing.
 Present pumps are direct current (DC) powered and are the original units installed in circa 1905. These pumps depend upon a single DC rectifier to convert power from the shipyards alternating current (AC) power grid. Replacement pumps will be modern, compact AC units. Project also repairs DD#2 Pumpwell building (B91) below grade by repairing and restoring damaged and deteriorated features / components along with, but not limited to, masonry repairs of walls as needed to eliminate water and air infiltration into facility.

This solicitation is being advertised as Unrestricted for full and open competition.  This is a source selection procurement requiring both non-price (technical and past performance) and price proposals, and will utilize the best value tradeoff continuum at FAR 15.101-1.
  The basis for evaluation and evaluation factors for award will be included in the solicitation.  Large business concerns are required to submit a subcontracting plan prior to award of the contract.

In accordance with DFARS 236.204, the magnitude of construction for this project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.

A Sources Sought Notice was issued on 21 November 2017 to determine the capability of small businesses to perform the requirement.  This notice did not yield any responses.
  Based upon analysis of the data considered, and in accordance with FAR 19.501(c), the Contracting Officer has determined that there is not a reasonable expectation that an adequate number of Small Business firms would respond to or be qualified to perform the requirements of this solicitation.  NAVFAC Mid-Atlantics Office of Small Business Programs concurs with this decision.

The drawings and specifications for this project will be posted with the solicitation and are not available at this time.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 22 March 2018.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, intends to award a sole source modification for engineering service support of Technology Insertion Hardware (TIH) 2020 (TI-20) under existing TIH contract N00253-14-D-0004 with DRS Laurel Technologies (DRS). The authority for this sole source modification is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. Contract N00253-14-D-0004 was competitively solicited and awarded on 29 September 2014 as a single award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract to DRS to execute development, integration, and production of Technology Insertion Hardware (TIH) for Technology Insertions 16 and 18 (TI-16/18). TIH is the latest generation of display, processor, and network requirements for Combat Control and Sonar Systems for Naval submarines. Equipment obtained under N00253-14-D-0004 is used in Mission Critical/Essential Systems on board submarine platforms. The proposed modification will add the ability to order engineering service and technical services support for TI-20 for a one (1) year period, 29 September 2018 through 28 September 2019, while the Government completes the TIH 20/22 full and open competitive procurement. The TI-20 engineering service will provide development and systems engineering support to baseline definition and technology refresh/insertion improvements for the TI-20 design for inclusion into applicable submarine variants. The engineering service design support will include, at a minimum: participation in TI-20 Technology Splinter Groups; participation in the AN/BYG-1 Integrated Process Teams (IPTs); attendance at Program Management Reviews; attendance at Quarterly Program Reviews; performing Trade Study Evaluations; providing System Engineering Designs for servers &amp; switches; initial drawing development; updating government furnished information and drawings for TI-20; delivering to the Government all data obtained and/or developed during the period of performance; and providing comprehensive transition to the TIH 20/22 competitive solicitation awardee.
<p>This modification is estimated to increase the contract ceiling by approximately $5.342 million. The TI-20 engineering service period of performance falls within the existing contract's period of performance. A security clearance of SECRET is required.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Justice, Justice Management Division, intends to procure on a sole source basis an online enterprise subscription to Law360 from Portfolio Media. Due to the proprietary nature of this publication, Portfolio Media is the only known source for this publication. The statutory authority for the proposed procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source. Law 360 is relied upon and used by the Department of Justice attorneys to conduct necessary legal research in preparation for the Department's court cases and is therefore essential to the Department's mission. Law360 is the only source that provides extensive coverage of current litigation and issues across a broad spectrum of legal topics, from Banking and Environmental to Product Liability and White Collar Crime, and includes coverage of law firms, government agencies, and companies as well. No other source provides the ease of use, daily coverage, and ready access to important documents all in one search, and includes expert analysis on top legal topics on a daily basis. For example, Law360 allows for ready access to news on a particular company, and that news will include litigation, documents, general activities, etc. - no other single source readily provides this information. The solicitation will not be distributed on the General Services Administration website (www.fbo.gov). The subscription procured under this synopsis must comply with the following Section 508 Accessibility Standards: 1194.22 Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Application, 1194.24 Video or Multimedia Products,1194.31 Functional performance criteria, and 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support (see http://www.section508.gov). This is not a formal solicitation, however, interested concerns must respond within fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice with written documentation, detailed data and pricing information that clearly demonstrates their ability to perform the requirement. Responses received as a result of this notice of intent shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />Responses will not be considered as either bids or proposals. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the written responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses to this notice must be submitted to Marla.Chesler@usdoj.gov and Eddie.Rozier@usdoj.gov. No telephone responses will be accepted.<br />

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific) intends to issue solicitation No. N66001-17-R-0170 for the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts to provide analysis and test engineering services to support for Analysis and Test Engineering of Tactical Data Link systems.  This effort also includes evaluation and implementation of other applications to support resolution of U.S. and Coalition/Allied military TDL interoperability communications problems.

<DESC>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential manufacturing sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited.
<p><br />The 422nd Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below. The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an Industry Day and/or Presolicitation Conference. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. Qualification requirements are set forth in DLA Aviation Source Approval Request Guide.
