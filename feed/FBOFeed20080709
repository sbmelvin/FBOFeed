<DESC>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is responsible for the management of on-shore fluid minerals.Current law requires that Federal lands first be offered for oil and gas leasing by competitive oral auction. In the FY2008, Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress directed that the BLM pilot an Internet lease auction as an alternative to the oral auctions required by the Mineral Leasing Act. This pilot examines the feasibility of conducting virtual auctions using the Internet. The pilot will also evaluate potential savings and benefits to the Federal government and lease sale participants. After the pilot, the BLM will then determine whether to recommend an amendment to the Mineral Leasing Act allowing for Internet lease auctions on a permanent basis. With that action, the BLM would consider incorporating the Internet lease auctions into its National Oil and Gas Lease Sale System (LSS).
The BLM is seeking a single Provider contractor with the ability to provide an Oil and Gas Lease Internet Auction Pilot (OGLIAP) System under a single management infrastructure. The objective is to provide the capability to conduct virtual oil and gas lease parcel auctions. 
The Contractor shall develop, operate, maintain, and enhance the OGLIAP system per requirements specified in the Systems Requirements Specification (SRS).  The contractor shall complete required system documentation. Operational support includes live Help Desk support during normal business hours (M-F, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Mountain Time).The pay.gov system allows users to make online electronic payments to the government using credit cards or electronic banking accounts. The pay.gov system will interface with OGLIAP to authenticate prospective Bidders and for submitting payments for parcels won during online auctions.

<RESPDATE>071808
<ARCHDATE>08022008
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676

<a href="mailto:steve.manley@faa.gov">steve.manley@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The FAA Surveillance and Broadcast Office is responsible for implementing the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system within the NAS for both essential and critical services by the year 2013.  The FY08 Conference Report accompanying H.R. 3074 has provided additional funding to the ADS-B program "specifically to expedite air to air capabilities".   FAA intends to utilize this funding to demonstrate ADS-B capabilities in the areas of surface conflict detection and cockpit alert capabilities.  These goals are consistent with the National Transportation Safety Board's concern with runway safety and FAA's desire to stimulate early adoption of ADS-B by the Airlines.      
The purpose of this market survey is to assess industry interest in the following proposed FAA activity.  
FAA has an interest in identifying performance requirements supporting enhanced airport surface applications and conflict detection/alerting.  
It is believed that airlines operating out of specific airports have established relationships with avionics manufacturers.  
FAA proposes to award multiple agreements under FAA's Other Transaction Authority to selected cooperative teams of airlines and manufacturers to develop performance requirements for airport surface conflict alerting cockpit capabilities.  These performance requirements are in support of RTCA SC-186 Work Group 1 "Application of Surface Conflict Management".  The RTCA committee is tasked to develop operational requirements and minimum performance standards for ADS-B.  The committee considers both airborne and ground user needs.  The developed performance requirements would be included in the RTCA ADS-B MOPS for surface alerting.  Identification of performance requirements would reduce ambiguity related to performance requirements and reduce risk, therefore allowing manufacturers to rapidly produce production ready avionics at lower costs.  
The teams would develop, test, and demonstrate designs at specific airports such as, but not limited to DFW, MIA, LGA, EWR, and IAH.    
The FAA would provide the ground infrastructure and environment to support TIS-B and ADS-R services.    
FAA plans to competitively solicit proposals in late July or early August.  Agreements are projected to be in place by October 2008.  Industry teams would be able to propose other airport locations, subject to availability of FAA infrastructure requirements.  Proposals would be evaluated considering the most benefit received versus the cost expended and other defined criteria to assess what is in the best interest of the FAA.    
The SBS program office is planning an industry day in late August to present details of the plan and respond to questions.  
This market survey solicits the following information:
1.	Indicated interest.  2.	Overall feasibility of the approach 3.	Confidence in forming cooperative teaming arrangements between airlines and manufacturers.  4.	Team member aircraft equipage configurations (transponders, displays, cockpit bags) or projected equipages.  5.	Perceived issues/hurdles.6.	Questions for industry day.  
Requests for industry day attendance should be made by July 31, 2008 to Ms. Amy Kirkham:  akirkham@regulus-group.com  Phone:  202-385-8394.     
Responses to this market survey are to be submitted to the following address no later than July 18, 2008.

This market survey is independent of an FAA Safety Services-Runway Safety Office (ATO-S) initiative to award agreements for industry partners to equip aircraft with either electronic flight bag moving map displays or aural runway alerting systems to aid in determining own ship position on the airport surface and enhance pilot situational awareness.  The partners in this effort will participate in an evaluation of the effectiveness of this technology.    
All communications and questions shall be directed to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Stephen B. Manley.  E-mail questions are preferred @ Steve.Manley@faa.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to make notice that the Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation numbered RFQ AG-0116-S-08-0056, for the Starr Dust Precommercial Thinning  project.  If the solicitation is released, it will be released through this FedBizOpps website, and prospective bidders should visit this FedBizOpps website from time to time on or after July 24, 2008, to obtain a copy of the solicitation. This notice meets the requirements of FAR 5.201. However, the Forest Service reserves the right not to release a solicitation. 
 
NOTE REGARDING FEDBIZOPPS LISTINGS. The FedBizOpps website has three separate listings for the Forest Service in Alaska. These are (1) R-10 Alaska Region, Juneau, AK; (2) R-10 Chugach National Forest, Anchorage, AK; and (3) R-10 Tongass National Forest, Ketchikan, AK.

<DESC>The intent of this project is to supply equipment, equipment operators, a laborer, and certified weed-free straw to restore a stream segment that was impacted by the Granite Fire of 1973.  The site proposed for treatment is Long Johns Meadow on the Groveland Ranger District, Stanislaus National Forest.  The rock (gradation of 6 inches to 3 foot rock, emphasizing the 1 foot to 2 foot size class) and fill (gravel, sand, silt, and clay) needed for the planned project may be obtained at Jawbone Quarry.  An excavator and loader would be needed at the quarry to stockpile all needed rock and fill prior to project implementation.  Approximately 100 yd3 of additional fill has been stockpiled near the intersection of 2N24 and 2N24A, and 100 yd3 of fill has been stockpiled along 2N08Y near Jawbone Quarry.  A total of 1,500 yd3 of fill and 280 yd3 of rock are needed to complete the project.  A water truck, filled at the Cherry Lake boat launch, would wet the fill at the quarry and the loader would be used to stir the water into the piles of fill.  Additional wetting of the fill may occur along 2N78.  The loader would stay on site at the quarry to load the dump truck, while the excavator would move onto Long Johns Meadow.

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement for a Tuberculosis Clinical Diagnostics Research Consortium (CDRC) to assess the performance of novel, early stage TB diagnostics. This contract shall establish the Tuberculosis Clinical Diagnostics Research Consortium (CDRC), a consortium of clinical study sites in TB-endemic countries to assess the performance of novel, early stage TB diagnostics in the context of existing clinical diagnostic algorithms. Diagnostic devices, technologies and assays eligible for evaluation under this contract must have demonstrated preliminary specificity and sensitivity against the target organism(s) and must be available as at least a quality assured prototype diagnostic device, assay or test. CDRC clinical studies shall be designed to determine how new diagnostics can most effectively contribute to diagnostic fidelity and/or speed in comparison to, or in concert with, currently utilized diagnostics, and to ready diagnostic tests for further development by commercial and/or other non-governmental sponsors. The CDRC shall also serve as a resource to the research community to provide support and advice for the early stage development of TB diagnostics in the clinical setting and contribute to the overall scheme for moving diagnostics into clinical validation. The goal of the Tuberculosis Clinical Diagnostics Research Consortium (CDRC) is to determine, early in the development process, where investigational diagnostics can be most appropriately positioned to improve speed and accuracy of TB diagnosis and/or the determination of drug resistance. The CDRC will evaluate experimental diagnostics not solely in comparison to stand alone &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; diagnostics tests, but will also enable evaluation of how these diagnostics perform within a clinical algorithm. This is particularly important since the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; currently used for TB diagnosis (the acid fast stain) is an antiquated test with limited specificity and sensitivity. Through evaluation of new diagnostic tests in combination with a clinical algorithm, it is expected that the CDRC will demonstrate that even diagnostic tests with limited sensitivity and specificity may nevertheless show great utility when evaluated in the context of a diagnostic process. It is anticipated that advanced preclinical development of diagnostic tests initially evaluated by the CDRC will be carried out by commercial sponsors, non-governmental organizations, and other government agencies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), other NIH funding sources, and other components of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Note: The CDRC is not intended to replace or compete with existing programs for clinical evaluation and implementation of new diagnostic tests but rather to assure, early in the development process, that new diagnostics indeed have the potential to contribute in a positive manner to existing diagnostic strategies. This approach is built on the premise of bringing together clinicians in the U.S. and TB-endemic countries with diagnostic developers at the earliest possible stage in the creation of new and improved tests. Initially, the Contractor shall provide up to two diagnostic tests for assessment by the CDRC; additional diagnostics may be identified by either the Contractor or by the research community. This project will NOT support: the development of new clinical research facilities and laboratories for testing new diagnostics; the development of new diagnostics and new assays; interventional clinical trials; studies to collect data to support a 510(k) application with the FDA; the establishment or maintenance of a publicly accessible specimen repository; or any development and testing of investigational drugs and vaccines for the treatment or prevention of TB. In summary, the contractor shall be required to: (1) establish and maintain the Tuberculosis Clinical Diagnostics Research Consortium, including clinical study sites and a CDRC data management center; (2) adhere to objectives and requirements for CDRC clinical studies, including study design and evaluation of diagnostic tests; (3) solicit, review, prioritize and recommend additional diagnostic candidates from the community; (4) develop clinical study plans and protocols for diagnostics; (5) provide protocol implementation, management, oversight, reporting and analysis; (6) establish an external scientific advisory group; and (7) develop and maintain the CDRC website. It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a seven-year period of performance beginning on or about June 30, 2009. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows: 20.95 FTE per year. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about July 23, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fbo.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile or e-mail transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban development (HUD) is issuing Request for Proposal Number R-CHI-00954 in support of the HUD headquarters, Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), Program Evaluation Division. One Indefinite-Quantity Contract (IQC) is expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation for 
Evaluation of Office University Partnership Programs. Several of HUD's community development grant programs would benefit from in-depth evaluations.  This IQC will give HUD the opportunity to conduct at least one or two of those evaluations.  Community Development activities include many different programs that provide assistance to a wide variety of grantees.  The aim of most such programs is to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income persons.
 
HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research regularly undertakes research relevant to community planning and development issues.  A few examples are: 
	CDBG Formula Targeting to Community Development Need (February 2005)
http://www.huduser.org/publications/commdevl/cdbgAssess.html
	Public-Sector Loans to Private-Sector Businesses: An Assessment of HUD-Supported Local Economic Development Lending Activities (July 2003)
http://www.huduser.org/publications/econdev/pubsec_loans.html
	The Impact of CDBG Spending on Urban Neighborhoods (October 2002)
http://www.huduser.org/publications/commdevl/cdbg_spending.html
	An Assessment of State Brownfields Initiatives (December 1999)
http://www.huduser.org/publications/econdev/assess.html
	Federal Funds, Local Choices: An Evaluation of the Community Development Block Grant Program (May 1995) http://www.huduser.org/publications/commdevl/cdbg.html

Most frequently, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program has been studied because it is such a large and complicated program.  CDBG can benefit from further research but so can some of the smaller community development programs. This IQC contract has a duration of 156 weeks (three years) from the date of award. This procurement is unrestricted. This is a competitive negotiated acquisition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15. All offerors are eligible to submit proposals.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990, Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, and the size standard is $6.5 million.

If the contractor awarded this contract is a large business concern, a subcontracting plan is required to be submitted with their proposal. The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) has established a 45 % small business goal for prime contractors. The solicitation package will be available on or about 15 days from this notification and proposals will be due on or 45 days from this announcement. This notice will be posted on HUDs Internet Home Page since HUD posts all required notices of its contracting opportunity at http//www.hud.gov/offices/cpo/Index.cfm. Potential offerors who download copies of solicitation from HUDs Home Page Contracting Opportunities or FedBizOpps will not automatically receive any amendments to those solicitations. You are advised to check back frequently to see if HUD has issued any amendments to the solicitation you have obtained. Hard copies of this solicitation may be obtained by writing to: Preston Brown, Contract Specialist, HUD Chicago Contracting Operations Branch, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Room 2517, Chicago, Illinois 60604-3507 or you may contact Preston Brown at 312.886.2760, extension 2508. Please make reference to the solicitation number R-CHI-00954.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:Steve.Garanin@volpe.dot.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovation Technology Administration, John a Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) intends to award a contract, based on a sole source procurement, to Sensis Corporation in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Volpe Center intends to procure, through a Firm-Fixed-Price contract, to provide the following services: set-up, access, on-site training and provide the JFK Air Traffic surface operations management service for one year starting with the establishment of the Government?s access to the service. The Sensis Corporation is currently the only company which has a commercially available airport surface management tool which has been approved by the FAA for integration with the FAA?s ASDE-X system through the ASDE-X data Distribution System. The Sensis Aerobahn airport management tools also have the unique capability to leverage the full complement of data from the JFK ASDE-X system with its gate-augmented multilateration surveillance infrastructure, which will provide the real time position of aircraft taxiing on the airport surface and into the gate areas.This combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items is prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Contracting Officer is utilizing policies and procedures prescribed in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items; FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation; and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26. The applicable North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334511; the Small Business size standard is 750 employees. STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) (begin) -- Background: According to the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, airport delay findings in August of 2007 depict New York City's three area airports as having the worst rates of flight delays in the US.  As a result, the Department of Transportation?s Secretary Mary Peters was asked to lead a task force to come up with recommendations for reducing the congestion by the end of 2007.   Based on the recommendations stemming from the task force, the FAA's Executive Council (EC) made the decision at their September 2007 meeting to expedite the deployment of ASDE-X at JFK, provide ASDE-X enhanced Multilateration ramp area surveillance and provide surface operations management tools to AT Operations by the end of FY08.  To meet this goal the implementation of a JFK aircraft operations management system must coincide with the completion of the overall ASDE-X and the Multilateration Ramp Surveillance system during FY08.The FAA is currently implementing ASDE-X systems at multiple airports in the National Airspace System (NAS) throughout the country. The ASDE-X provides Air Traffic Local and Ground Controllers with situational awareness of aircraft and vehicles within the airport movement area. The ADSE-X at JFK is the FAA?s primary technology to minimize runway incursions and accidents.  ASDE-X also provides a data distribution capability which will provide airport operations management software the necessary airport surface and approach surveillance data.  ASDE-X is scheduled to be installed at JFK during the winter of 2007; the system is scheduled for commissioning in July 2008.  The Volpe Center is assisting the FAA?s Air Traffic Organization ? Operations Planning (ATO-P) Advanced Technology Development and Prototyping Group, in conducting applied research and development on Surface Decision Support Systems (SDSS), which promise to improve surface movement efficiency at busy hubs in support of NextGen concepts. The SDSS development effort will provide JFK FAA Air Traffic Operations an Airport Operations Management service in an effort to allow the FAA to assess the effectiveness of this type of operations management tool.  JFK Air Traffic Operations Management Service:The Government has an immediate need to observe and measure the performance of the airport surface operations at JFK in real-time, with the objective of identifying policies and procedures that could be implemented to improve taxi times, fuel savings, and emissions reductions.  To accomplish this the Government requires a year of JFK airport air traffic operations management service which shall provide a minimum of five FAA users with a service that includes real-time surface situational awareness of JFK airport air traffic and ramp operations and a comprehensive operations analysis capability.  The service shall be derived from an existing commercial solution and will be made available to only Government selected FAA authorized users at locations such as JFK ramp towers, the ATC Tower and/or the JFK associated TRACON.  The Government envisions that this service will be supported by a web-based architecture.  The service shall provide the authorized users with the JFK AT Surface Operations event processing and database management features.  This shall allow the FAA users a real time and common view of the required operations management functions and features defined here in:The service shall be continuously available to a minimum of five FAA authorized users, 24 hours a day for a year from acceptance of the service. All hardware, software, and communications services needed to support the service will be owned or leased and maintained by the contractor for the period of performance. The contractor is not responsible for hardware and software, in the context of displays, workstations or terminals necessary to access the service through the internet. The service shall be dependent on data available from the JFK ASDE-X Data Distribution System.  Reference the latest version of: Interface Control Document - ASDE-X - Data Distribution (DD) to End Users, Sensis Document No.: 790-010712.
The contractor shall be responsible for all the necessary permits or memorandums of understanding with the FAA required for access to ASDE-X data through the JFK ASDE-X Data Distribution cabinet.  Reference the latest version of FAA Order 1200.22C NAS Data and Interface Equipment Used by Outside Interests. 
The contractor shall provide the training to support the JFK operations management service defined within the scope of this SOW.  The operations management system shall provide:   the capability to support operations at JFK ATCT and FAA ATCSCC;a minimum of five users with simultaneous real-time data query and reporting capabilities from a web-based portal;  common situational awareness to all the authorized users;  and a function for the real time monitoring of the position and status of aircraft and vehicles within the JFK ASDE-X and Multilateration Ramp surveillance coverage areas.  Airport situation awareness presentations shall include target positions with flight numbers, as available; the functionality to provide a snapshot summary of current airport operations, updated in real-time, available to allow an assessment of the status of specific elements of the operation, including arrival and departure rates, and status of taxiing aircraft; a real-time view of departure demand on the non-movement and movement areas of JFK Airport; a function to establish adaptable thresholds to alert the users of specific operational events including taxi out delays and aircraft returns to the gate; a function to view aircraft arrival statistics and contrast the arrival demand with current availability of gates; and analytical and reporting capabilities of real time and historical arrival and departure data including functions to playback operational events. The playback mechanism shall include the capability to adjust the speed of a playback with an operator selected aircraft visually highlighted; measure runway, taxiway, spot, and gate occupancy times; measure taxi out and taxi in times, including length of time aircraft wait to cross active runways; measure throughput of specific regions of the airfield (i.e. queues to deicing pads and transition areas); monitor departure queues;   visually identify priority flights; and the functionality to allow the generation of daily, weekly monthly, quarterly, and yearly operational reports. Deliverables:  (1) The Contractor shall set-up and provide the Government access to the airport surface management data service within 30 days after date of award; (2) The Contractor shall provide on-site training for up to five authorized users within 40 days after date of award; and (3) The Contractor shall provide the JFK AT Surface Operations Management service for one year (12 months) starting with the establishment of the Government?s access to the service.

<DESC>I.	Purpose:
The purpose of this Screening Information Request (SIR) is to seek competent and suitable sources for the subject project. Responses to the SIR will be used to screen qualified companies. Screening information will allow the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to determine which offerors are more likely to receive award, and ultimately, which offers will provide the FAA with the best value. The FAA has appointed an Integrated Product Team (IPT) which will evaluate each response received and make a selection of qualified offerors based on the evaluation criteria established in this SIR. The SIR evaluation process may involve face-to-face negotiations with one or more offerors. The intent of these negotiations is for the FAA evaluators, or IPT, to gain a better understanding of the proposed project and/or clarify evaluation information submitted by the offeror. All offerors that are eliminated from the competition will be notified in writing.
II.	Scope of Project:

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH SYNOPSIS FOR MUZZLE FLASH DETECTION DEVICES
The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying the requirement for muzzle flash detection devices for the purpose of determining their utility in detecting hostile small arms fire that may be procured in the near future. This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public. The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements. If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist, the Government may entertain the procurement of developmental items based on the information received as a result of this market research. The Market Research Synopsis for this effort was previously published utilizing Tracking #9018. Sources that responded to the previous synopsis should also respond to this Market Research Synopsis. Information on capable sources is sought for the follow requirements: 
SCOPE.  Snipers and small arms fire (SAF) have caused significant Coalition Force (CF) casualties to date in Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF) and Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF), and have been a source of considerable disruption to those operations.  As a result, MCWL has made finding, testing, and evaluating counter-sniper technologies one of its top priorities. The ability of a dismounted system to locate, by muzzle flash, incoming enemy fire and then transmit the relative bearing and absolute position of the source of fire to distributed friendly forces for engagement shall be demonstrated at a TRL level 7 or above.
BACKGROUND.  The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) at Quantico, VA is interested in conducting a shoot off of existing, ruggedized, small form factor, counter sniper systems at a TRL Level 7 or above. Ground forces fighting in urban and rural environments face a serious threat of random and precision small arms attacks. When these attacks occur, immediate situational awareness of the presence of a threat and the threats physical location can significantly increase the warfighters ability to respond to and neutralize the threat. 
Responses addressing the following technical approach are welcome.
TASK DESCRIPTION.     
Task One: Ruggedized, Dismounted Muzzle Flash Detection Technology
MCWL assumes that such a system will be man-portable and shall integrate all of the following technologies:
	Electro Optical / IR scanning capability	Ability to handle multiple fire sources	Day and night operation	Long range detection (> 1km)	Eye safe laser range finder	Built in GPS	Base station control center to which multiple distributed forces       subscribe	Hardware connecting subscribers wirelessly with base station	Translation of enemy muzzle flash location such that it is         relevant to subscribers	Zoom camera to allow identification of source of muzzle flash
Other desirable technologies may include:		Overlay integration with standard mapping software	Ability to mark the muzzle flash target with laser marker
Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information should include: 1) identification of your company or organization, 2) your company's or organization's assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements, 3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact information, 4) notification of business size and/or special status and 5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall adhere to a five (5) page submission limit, plus commercial marketing information or web links and all should be submitted via email to ira.patterson@usmc.mil referencing the following tracking #9035. These should be submitted on or before 21 July 2008. This market research announcement should not be considered a commitment of any kind by the Government and individual correspondence should not be expected in advance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for the proposed requirements.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement to install CCTV Security Surveillance System cameras on the 13th and 14th Floors of the Jamaica Plain campus.  The system must interface with the existing system.  A fixed price requirements contract with a base of date of award through September 30, 2008 with no options is anticipated and shall be awarded.  It is the Governments belief that only Team AVS, the previous installer, possesses the required capabilities to successfully install and interface with the existing system.  It is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate only with Team AVS.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION	1.  Identification of (1) the agency and (2) the contracting activity:	(1) VA Medical Center, Jamaica Plain Campus, Boston, MA	(2) Acquisition and Material Management Service	    940 Belmont Street	    Brockton, MA  023012.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:	This documentation is to support the award of a sole-source 	award to Team AVS.  The VA has a critical need to add 	additional cameras and video head-end units to an existing 	closed circuit television (CCTV) security surveillance 	system. Due to funding restrictions, the 13th and 14th floors 	of the Jamaica Plain campus have not been included in the 	existing security surveillance system.  The Massachusetts 	Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center 	(MAVERIC) is housed on these floors.  MAVERIC is charged with 	managing and coordinating long-term clinical trials 	related to veterans health issues and well as other research 	related to veterans.  At any given time MAVERIC is 	responsible for approximately 9 on-going research efforts.  	Since these studies and research projects are related to 	veterans health issues, there is a myriad quantity of 	protected health information contained in the files housed at 	MAVERIC.  Various VA and federal mandates such as HIPPA, 	Privacy Act, as well as Information Technology regulations 	are in effect and apply to the safeguarding of this health 	information. 3.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the      agency's needs (including the estimated value):	The estimated value of the parts and labor to install 	cameras, video head-end units, and all components necessary 	to interface with an existing CCTV security surveillance 	system is approximately $35,000.00. 4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting otherthan full and open competition:	FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority sited: 1.	The proposed contractor is an Authorized Government Reseller for PELCO products under GSA contract GS-03F-4079B.  2.	The present CCTV Security Surveillance System covers all three (3) divisions of the Boston Health Care System, i.e. Jamaica Plain, West Roxbury, and Brockton.  As funds have become available, additional departments, units, floors, projects, etc. have tied into the CCTV Security Surveillance System that was initially installed at the Jamaica Plain campus in 1986.  The system as installed represents a significant financial investment.  3.	The proposed contractor has installed all parts of the existing system.  Portions of the entire system remain under warranty with the proposed contractor.4.	The system operates as an entity and ties all the campuses together so that backup surveillance can be conducted at any of the Police Headquarters located at each of the three (3) Boston area locations.  The proposed contractor has the  as-built drawings and wiring diagrams for the entire system.  This documentation exists only with the proposed contractor.  Another vendor would need their own sets of drawings and diagrams (of the entire system) and this would take more time than is currently available. The requested 13th and 14th floor camera installation project is needed immediately in order for the VA to be in compliance with current IT security mandates.5.	Another area requiring consistency is the technical nature or the work required. If multiple vendors are allowed to work on the system at the same time, for repairs, installations, upgrades, etc. the VA would eventually be placed in the position of trying to resolve disputes about which contractor has adversely affected the operation of the system. Disputes of this nature could easily require outside experts to resolve, whereas, if a single contractor is doing the work no such disputes can arise. 6.   Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable,including whether a notice was or will be published:  	An intent to sole-source notice will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  Due to the nature of the work required and the time constraints, it is in the governments best interest to negotiate and anticipate award to the proposed contractor, Team AVS. 7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated     cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The anticipated cost of this requirement is approximately $35,000.00.  This includes labor, materials, and equipment to complete the installation.  Hourly wage rates have been discussed, pricing for the cameras and associated materials and other equipment is in accordance with GSA pricing.  Where the items are not on GSA schedule, the proposed Contractor has used the same pricing margin as on the GSA schedule items.  These factors combined with other factors, indicate the prices proposed are fair and reasonable.8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names, of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.	Review of the GSA schedule (GS-03F-4079B) indicates there are two possible sources for meeting this requirement.  9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data      packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.  See factor number 5 for a complete description of the technical nature of this requirement.  See factor number 11 for future requirements.10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.  Galaxy Integrated Technologies11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to   remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any    subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.The contracting activity is reviewing the possibility of soliciting for an award of an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract to provide maintenance on the existing CCTV security surveillance system as well as installation of any new portions of the three existing campuses that may be required as project funds become available.

<DESC>I.	BackgroundNASA is in the concept phase to identify key performance indicators for the successfuldesign and production of the Ares V vehicle.   Our goal is to meet NASAs LunarExploration requirements at the lowest life cycle cost.  NASA is developing an Ares Vintegrated acquisition strategy to meet Constellations flight manifest while maximizingcompetition.  Early planning also involves analysis of synergies to be gained fromexisting NASA projects such as Ares I and the Space Shuttle Program.  II.	    ObjectiveThis RFI is issued to disseminate and request information from the aerospace industry perthe evolving Ares V requirements and specifically to give industry an opportunity tounderstand and provide input to the Government's acquisition planning.	 III.	    Technical RequirementsThe Ares V point of departure architecture is included as a separate attachment. Specific technical areas for comment may be requested in the future.  Note that theConstellation Program will look for commonality in technical requirements and reportingbetween its projects, and will use commercial items and processes when available andwhich better meet its needs. IV.	Acquisition StrategyA.  Initial planning and market research has begun for all elements of the Ares Vvehicle.  These plans are in the early stages of planning and will be refinedsignificantly over the next several months.  Industry involvement early in the NASA leddesign and development phase is highly desirable.  Therefore, we are reviewing strategiesthat include the potential for concept design contracts to be awarded as early as thefirst half of calendar year 2009.  The Ares V planned acquisition approach will utilizethese guiding principles: 1. Maximize competition for all elements to include the ability to re-compete atappropriate times.2.  Procure sufficient data, and identify production techniques and ease of operabilityto maximize the use of fixed price type contracts and competition for long termproduction efforts.3.  Leverage existing programs to include Shuttle, on-going Constellation efforts, andany on-going industry programs (i.e., non-NASA) if they lead to an overall lower lifecycle cost.4.  Effectively enable a blend of NASA led design efforts with contractorinvolvement while maintaining a competitive environment until the most effective time toaward full scale development and production contracts.5.  Develop the appropriate set of performance measures and incentives.6.  Leverage existing industry programs.7.  Review all requirements from a zero-based approach.8.  Maximize the use of all categories of small businesses, with particular emphasis insignificant technical areas.9. Optimize the cost/risk relationship for Ares V procurements.B.  Using these principles as a guide, industry is invited to provide inputs in thefollowing specific areas:1. Pros and cons of early, multiple, fixed price concept design contracts that are partof phased acquisitions with subsequent competitions and award at a major programmilestone such as System Design Review (SDR) or Preliminary Design Review (PDR).  Discussall alternatives you would like NASA to consider.2. Identify barriers to competition in any Ares V element that could be mitigated tofoster a more competitive environment.	3. Discuss alternative procurement approaches to the Ares V stack integration approach. One alternative would be to compete a dedicated support contract for all Ares V stackdevelopment activities (e.g. systems management, requirements and verification,integrated design and analysis, supportability, etc.) in lieu of utilizing existingcenter institutional support contracts.  In either case, appropriate organizationalconflict of interest clauses would be implemented.4. Discuss alternative procurement approaches to the hardware element approach followedin the Ares-1 procurement.  One alternative would be to compete based on the primaryfunction (composite dry structures, metallic cryogenic tank systems, integrated stages,etc) vs. the individual major elements themselves (first stage, core stage, earthdeparture stage, shroud, etc). 5. Recommend process improvements and efficiencies, both in the acquisition phase as wellas the performance phase, along with identification of non-value added steps. V.	Review of Shuttle AssetsNASAs number one priority is to safely complete the Shuttle manifest.	 Shuttleinventories of parts, tooling, raw materials and manufactured articles are in some areasalready at levels over and above that required to safely complete the Shuttle mission.	NASA is, and will continue processing such property through the appropriate propertydisposal process.  This includes utilizing excess Shuttle property for Ares Vdevelopment.  To ensure we diligently review all potential uses, industry is requested toreview and comment on the following general areas:1.	Potential reuse of Shuttle property for Ares V using the existing Point ofDeparture.2.	Recommendations for efficient storage of assets, such as cost sharing and rentfree use of Industry underutilized warehouse space pending reuse for other programs.3.	Recommendations for maximizing the Governments return on property sold beyondthe normal Government property disposition process. Lists of currently identified inventory may be posted to ensure industry is fully awareof the types of materials, parts, and tooling that may become available.  VI.	SummaryWhile there is no formal page limit or format, a page guideline of 30 pages isrecommended for the primary narrative text response. Inputs shall be compliant with alllegal and regulatory requirements concerning limitations on export controlled items. Responses are requested to be submitted in Microsoft Office products in a user friendlyenvironment to facilitate review.  One hard copy and 3 CDs or DVDs are requested. Responses are to be submitted no later than August 4, 2008, to Earl Pendley/PS43/MarshallSpace Flight Center, AL 35812.	Ares V will be the vehicle to enable the United States to return to the moon and beyond. Merging NASAs and industrys core expertise will foster this endeavor.  Decisions madenow in our early planning phase may have significant impacts for decades to come.  Wesolicit your response and will continue to utilize this site to provide further updatesto include the possibility of an Ares V Industry Day.	Any questions can be directed toEarl Pendley at 256-544-2949.

<DESC>Notice is provided that the US Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for construction of the River Chamber, Charleroi Locks and Dam; Monongahela River, Pennsylvania in April 2009.  The purpose of this notice is to disseminate information and obtain comments and suggestions from prospective contractors pertaining to this requirement.  At this time, pricing and/or technical proposals are not to be submitted.  Participation in this process is strictly voluntary and there will be no compensation provided for participation.  Construction of the River Chamber is the second contract for the new Charleroi Locks Construction; the River Wall is currently being constructed under a separate contract.  

The following provides a brief background of the efforts, past and future, being taken by the Pittsburgh District of the US Army Corps of Engineers to modernize the navigation facilities on the Lower Monongahela (Lower Mon) river.  The Lower Mon river navigation facilities include Braddock Locks and Dam (L/D), L/D #3 (Elizabeth), and Charleroi L/D.  These are the three oldest currently operating navigation facilities on the Monongahela River, constructed in 1902, 1905, and 1931, respectively.  The condition and age of these facilities are the driving force behind the project authorization in the Water Resources Development Act of 1992.  In addition to supporting the highest volume of commercial traffic on the Monongahela River, the pools created by these facilities also support industrial and municipal water needs, and are popular with recreational boaters.  The project includes replacement of the fixed crest dam at Braddock with a new gated dam, which was completed in 2004; construction of new larger locks (twin 84x720 foot) at Charleroi (L/D 4); removal of L/D #3; dredging existing Pool 3 to ensure an authorized 9 foot deep navigation channel; and various facility relocations including publicly owned shore side facilities and a railroad bridge adversely affected by the project.

Charleroi L/D work efforts, associated with the Lower Mon project, began in 2002 with the award of a site development contract which provided new buildings, utilities, and access to the site.  This contract was completed in 2005.  In 2003, the River Chamber Demolition Contract was awarded.   Under this contract, the existing floor and struts of the river chamber were removed, coffer closures installed, and the coffer area placed on high pool for stabilizing the existing middle wall; this contract was completed in 2005.  In 2004, a contract was awarded to construct the new Charleroi river wall.  This contract is currently scheduled to be complete in 2010.  In 2007, the Victory Hollow Site Development was awarded.  This contract, which will be completed in 2008, prepares the Governments upland disposal site for receipt of dredge material and rubble.  The work described herein, provides information related to the completion of the Charleroi river chamber.  Concurrent with the river chamber construction, the Government intends to begin dredging pool 3 and develop plans for the removal of L/D 3.  Upon substantial completion of the Charleroi river chamber, it is the Governments intent to solicit for the construction of Charleroi land chamber.

The information contained in this notice is not all encompassing and is subject to change at the discretion of the Government as the Plans and Specifications are finalized.  The following documents are provided as part of the notice:  Selected Contract Drawings (to show major components of work, sequencing, and work restrictions); Selected Technical Narrative (to show proposed contract payment line items and to show details of the major features of work); Low Price Technically Acceptable Criteria (to define the source selection process; Proposed Funding Profile; and the Continuing Contracts Clause.

The magnitude of this project is estimated between $100,000,000 and $250,000,000.  The proposed period of performance is six (6) years.  In accordance with FAR 15.101-2, the source selection method for this procurement will be Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).  Under this method, contract award will be made to the offeror that satisfies the governments minimum technical requirements and proposes the overall lowest price.

COMMENTS AREAS:  All comments and suggestions received on this notice will be evaluated and utilized, as applicable, in the preparation of the final RFP. The Government will retain all comments and/or suggestions received.  Replies to comments or suggestions will not be provided.  The following is a list of items that the Government would like to receive comments; however, prospective offerors may provide any comments they would like the Government to consider when developing the RFP.

a)  Length of Contract Question:  Do you think the proposed period of performance (contract duration) is sufficient considering the overlap of the River Wall and the River Chamber contracts considering the restrictions on work areas, batch plant, etc.?

b)  Bonding:  Do you have any concerns over bonding issues related to the value and duration of the contract?

c)  Low Price technically Acceptable (LPTA) Method:  Do you have any concerns or comments about our LPTA method and/or the proposed criteria?

d)  Funding and Funding Profile:  Do you have concerns or comments about the anticipated funding profile and the requirement to execute at or below the funding profile in accordance with the Continuing Contracts Clause?

e)  Funding and Sequence:  Does the anticipated funding profile present any constraints to the sequential execution of construction?

f)  EPA Clause:  The Government is considering use of an Economic Price Adjustment clause for steel on this project.  Are there any comments or concerns about the proposed Economic Price adjustment?  Are there any other commodities you would be interested in seeing in the final RFP that would be covered by this clause, if included?

Your comments and/or suggestions may be used to finalize the RFP.  Out intent is to issue a RFP that meets Governments minimum requirements and affords potential offerors the greatest opportunity for success.  Please provide any comments and/or suggestions you wish to contribute as soon as possible, but no later than August 27, 2008.  Comments and/or suggestions may be transmitted either by mail, email, or via facsimile.  Facsimile transmissions can be sent to (412) 644-5109.  Submit electronic submissions to the following e-mail address:  carole.householder@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to High Desert Special Operations Center (HDSOC), 410 E Street, Hawthorne, NV  89415-1237 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.
Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to provide pre-mission training at Hawthorne Army Depot, Hawthorne, NV during the period 25  through 31 July 2008 and 12 August through 22 August 2008.
The information received to support this sole source reveals that the environment in the Hawthorne, NV area closely resembles that of Afghanistan, consequently providing the most realistic training environment for these Marines.  
Further, HQ Army Sustainment Command issued a no-cost agreement to HDSOC for sole source use of the ranges on Hawthorne Army Depot.  This agreement limits the use of the ranges to providing training to HDSOC only.
This notice is not a request for offers.
The anticipated date of award is 18 July 2008.
The contractor has sole authority from the United States Army Sustainment Command to use the ranges required for this training at the Hawthorne Army Depot. The information received to support this sole source reveals the environment in the Hawthorne, NV area closely resembles that of Afghanistan, consequently providing the most realistic training environment for the Marines.  Because of the inability of any other contractor to obtain authority to training on these ranges, and because it is necessary for the Marines to train during these periods and in this environment, the contractor identified is the only known source for the subject requirement. 
Responses to this notice will be used to determine if bona fide competition exists to provide pre-mission training at Hawthorne Army Depot.
The services shall include extensive protective security detail training to include high speed auto cross/battle damage assessment and repair and mobilization training.  Services shall also include mobility training consistiing of off-road driving, environmental driving, ambush/IED lane training, mounted live fire, situational training exercises, and the use of role players.  
Vendor responses shall be in writing and include documents that clearly demonstrate the ability to train on the Hawthorne Army Depot and have full use of the installation ranges and other facilities to support this training.
All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered.  However, determination to compete or not to compete this requirement is solely at the discretion of the Government.
No extensions will be granted.
The Government will not pay for any information submitted.  Only electronic submissions will be accepted.  No telephone responses will be accepted.

The system will be used in the fiber-based characterization of nanofabricated optical waveguides.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

 Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Optical Microscope and Waveguide Alignment System, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:

System specifications:

The system consists of three major sub-systems: (1) fiber-waveguide-fiber alignment unit, (2) 2-axis optical microscope, and (3) end-face monitoring system. The requirements for each of these sub-systems are listed after noting one general specification.  

&#61607;	General specification

The optical axis of the system (the height at which the fiber and waveguides shall be held) shall be between 150 mm  180 mm at the midpoint of all vertical stage travel.  This optical axis shall be maintained by the entire fiber-waveguide-fiber alignment unit, and the 2-axis optical microscope and end-face monitoring unit shall be appropriately mounted for imaging at this height.  Therefore, any adapter plates or pieces needed to achieve this shall be included.    

1.	Fiber-waveguide-fiber alignment unit

a.	First fiber alignment unit
i.	5-axis translation stage, with three motorized axes (x, y, and z motion) and two manual axes (tip and tilt).  
ii.	For motorized axes, travel distance shall be at least 20 mm
iii.	Motors shall be stepper motors that achieve a minimum stage translation step size of 50 nm or smaller
iv.	Motorized axes shall have a limit switch and an origin sensor
v.	Motorized axes shall have a backlash of 500 nm or smaller
vi.	Tip/tilt axes shall be micrometer driven and each axis shall have a travel distance of at least +/-3 degrees
vii.	Stage shall come equipped with a 100% compatible fiber holder for holding a bare optical fiber in a fixed position.  The bare fiber shall have a jacket diameter of 250 microns.  The bare fiber shall be held at a height between 150 mm  180 mm, consistent with the optical axis height described in the general specification above.  
viii.	Shall come equipped with a 6-axis stage controller that is 100% compatible with the motorized axes of the 5-axis translation stage (although only three axes shall be used for this stage, an additional 3 axes of control are needed for future expansion of the system).  The stage controller shall have a computer interface via GPIB or USB.
b.	Waveguide holder unit
i.	Unit consists of a stationary block in which a waveguide sample (6 mm x 10 mm in size) is held fixed using both a mechanical clamp and vacuum.    Vacuum is to be applied through a series of holes on the top surface of the unit that are connected to a single vacuum port.     
ii.	Unit shall hold waveguide at the same optical axis height as the first fiber alignment unit.  The in-plane dimensions of the portion of the unit upon which the waveguide is mounted shall not exceed 10 mm x 40 mm.
iii.	Unit shall come equipped with a dry (oil-free) vacuum pump and hose that are 100% compatible with the waveguide holder and its vacuum port.
iv.	Unit shall also come equipped with a release valve that allows for the vacuum to be disabled without turning off the pump
c.	Second fiber alignment unit
i.	5-axis translation stage in which all five axes (x,y,z, tip, and tilt) are manually actuated.  
ii.	All axes shall be micrometer driven 
iii.	Each of the x, y, and z axes shall be driven with either a single micrometer or a pair of micrometers that offer(s) both coarse and fine adjustment, with a fine adjustment resolution of 500 nm per division or better and a coarse adjustment resolution that is smaller than the fine adjustment travel distance.  The coarse adjustment travel distance shall be at least 12 mm. 
iv.	Tip/tilt axes shall each have a travel distance of at least +/-3 degrees
v.	This translation stage shall have the opposite handedness of the motorized/manual translation stage in specification 1.a above.  That is, if the motorized/manual translation stage in specification 1.a is a right-handed stage, this shall be a left-handed stage, and vice versa.
vi.	Stage shall come equipped with a 100% compatible fiber holder for holding a bare optical fiber in a fixed position.  The bare fiber shall have a jacket diameter of 250 microns.  The bare fiber shall be held at the same optical axis height as the first fiber alignment unit and the waveguide holder unit, so that any adapter plates needed to achieve this shall be included.

2.	2-axis optical microscope

a.	Monitoring stage unit that supports two right-angled zoom barrel microscopes for providing imaging along orthogonal axes (e.g., topside and backside) simultaneously.  The stage unit shall provide at least 25 mm of travel distance along three orthogonal axes (both focusing dimensions as well as the non-focusing dimension).
b.	Long travel stage upon which the monitoring stage unit is mounted.  The stage shall allow for travel along the non-focusing dimension with a travel distance of at least 10.  It shall be 100% compatible with the monitoring stage unit.  
c.	Platform upon which the long travel stage and monitoring stage unit shall be mounted. The platform shall be 100% compatible with the long travel stage and monitoring stage unit.  Its height shall be appropriate so that when the monitoring stage unit and zoom barrels are mounted on top of it, they can image the fiber-waveguide-fiber alignment region at the optical axis height.  
d.	Two right-angle zoom barrel systems that are 100% compatible with the monitoring stage unit.  Each zoom barrel system shall consist of the following components:
i.	Zoom head with a zoom range of at least 0.6X  7 X (a wider zoom range is acceptable).  The zoom head shall have a port for co-axial illumination.
ii.	Non-inverting right angle adapter prism that attaches to the zoom head and introduces a 90o bend in the imaging axis while maintaining an erect image that reads left to right. 
iii.	2X magnification adapter tube that attaches to the non-inverting right angle adapter prism.
iv.	Mounting clamp that clamps onto the 2X magnification adapter tube and can be mounted onto the monitoring stage unit.  
v.	C-mount coupler to make zoom barrel system compatible with a C-mount CCD camera
e.	Two fiber optic illuminators for use with the zoom heads.  The illuminators shall be based on a halogen lamp or equivalent.
f.	Two fiber optic bundles/light guides that are 100% compatible with the fiber optic illuminators and are between 48 in length.  The light guides shall also be compatible with the co-axial illumination ports on the zoom heads.  
g.	Two 20X long working distance microscope objectives with a working distance of at least 20 mm and a numerical aperture of at least 0.42.  The objective shall be 100% compatible with the zoom heads  any adapters needed to mate the two shall be included

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)

 (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given 
such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) are established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011. 

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 21 July 2008, 4:15 p.m., EST.     All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.     Anticipated award date is on or about July 28, 2008. Contact Steve Metcalfe at Steven.H.Metcalfe@uscg.mil or 252-335-6714 for questions regarding this solicitation.     Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above address, facsimile copies are acceptable and should be faxed to 252-335-6790, or at the following address:

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

Closing date and time for receipt of quotes is JUL 21, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Contact Regina Gardner at regina.gardner@uscg.mil or 252-334-5051 for questions regarding this solicitation.  Quotes will be accepted via at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-6840.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

<DESC>This is modification 3 to the synopsis entitled Mast Climbers-Scaffolding which wasposted on June 11, 2008.  The following questions have been submitted with answers.1.QUESTION:Will there be any external forces on the mast climber during testing?ANSWER:The only external forces would be from movement of the building due to windloads andvibration.  Under 70 m.p.h winds, the top of the building moves 10".2.QUESTION:Is there a desired speed of travel?ANSWER:Yes, a minimum of 25 feet per minute.3. QUESTION:Where on the drawings are the access points shown?ANSWER:They are close to the mast. You should see a note on the drawing calling for a gate 36"wide.4.QUESTION:Can we bid a plain machine that meets the requirements as well as a machine that meetsthe requirements plus has some options?ANSWER:Yes5.QUESTION:Can we anchor into the steel where there is no concrete?ANSWER:The floor may be covered with a self leveling grout.  We have the lay out of the floor soeveryone will know where the steel is.6.QUESTION:Will options be considered separately or in total?ANSWER:All options shall be quoted separately7.QUESTIONS:Could we offer a different solution to the two mast climbers asked for?ANSWER:Different solutions will be considered as long as it meets the present statement of workand is technically acceptable.8.QUESTION:Will the middle area be open?ANSWER:Yes, this is where the test article will be.9.QUESTION:Can we link two towers in the middle?ANSWER:No.10.QUESTION:Can the corners on the platform be squared instead of gradual?ANSWER:No, the corners need to be rounded edges11.QUESTION:Do the gates by the mastclimber drive units have to be 36" wide or can they be smaller?ANSWER:Yes,they must be 36" wide,  because we will have equipment that will be wheeled onto theplatforms on carts.  These carts need a 36" opening.12.QUESTION:(Single Configuration)-What is the maximum length configuration for the singlemastclimber?ANSWER:Whatever the recommended length is per the manufacturer.13.QUESTION:Do you want the single mastclimber to be configured in a straight line or ina U shape? If in a U shape, what is the maximum length of the deck on either side of thedrive unit?ANSWER:It will be straight14.QUESTION: I see on the blueprints that there are two twin mastclimber units (4 driveunits). Will you only want to purchase one twin (2 drive units) or will it be two twins(4 drive units)ANSWER:4 drive units15.QUESTION:What is the maximum lenght of the mastclimber? (working height and tower height)ANSWER:The tower height is on the drawing.  The max platform height will be about 8 feet belowthat.16.QUESTION:What is the maximum outside diameter that the mastclimber deck/work platform can be? Whatis the diameter of the structure where the mastclimber will be installed?ANSWER:The outside dimensions of the platforms at the towers is 412". The outside dimensions ofthe platforms 90 degrees from the towers is 365". These are max. dimensions because ofthe location of the other test location in the building and the clearance we would liketo have from the building. The test article diameter varies form 152" to 146".The due date for responses  is not extended.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

Responses must also contain information demonstrating the interested contractor's ability to meet the following technical requirements: (1) Ability to support the in field integration, test, and launch of a variety of launch vehicles (one or more stages) while meeting all technical, mission, and safety requirements including any possible pathfinder activities; (2) Ability to provide the interface between range (on site and remote sites) and United States Air Force (USAF) personnel; (3) Ability to provide: a) logistics support (air, sea, rail, and ground operations) to and from the Spaceport for all program related equipment, facilities, and assets, and b) data as applicable; (4) Ability to provide support services during processing, testing, and launch, including the ability to provide or arrange for propellants, liquids and gases as needed; (5) Ability to provide engineering services for modifications to facilities to meet system or experiment requirements; (6) Ability to provide the necessary facilities and facility operations support, including the ability to provide a payload processing and test facility with 100,000 class clean room capability, to provide a storage facility for the vehicle components and all associated handling equipment and to provide a magazine for storing ordnance as applicable or when no government facilities are available; and (7) Ability to provide program management support for vehicle and ground hardware transportation, processing, integration, testing, and launch.</p>
<p><br />The contractor should submit only unclassified information. If you are interested only in subcontracting possibilities, please indicate this clearly in your submission. Initial award of any resultant contract, if any, is anticipated by August 2009. Foreign vendors interested in submitting a SOC may do so, but are advised that they may not be allowed to participate in this acquisition at the prime contractor level as the research and test data produced may contain information whose export may be restricted. All responses shall include the vendor's size status and socioeconomic designation (8a, women owned, veteran owned, etc.) under the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 488999, and corresponding size standard of $6.5M in average annual receipts.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 2 to BAA08-21 Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Network GATEway (MAINGATE)
The purpose of Amendment 2 to BAA08-21 Mobile Ad hoc Interoperability Network GATEway (MAINGATE) is to make the following changes:

1.  Page 10, Section 1.1.1 entitled Technical Description, under the heading Wireless IP Network, the sixth sentence is revised to read as follows:
It also is envisioned that the higher frequency bands can exploit directional antennas and thus the goal is to increase the information rate to 100 Mbps using a gateway, and a high data rate disk data link system like Common Data Link (CDL) or Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL).
2.  Pages 12-14, replace sections 1.1.2 through 1.1.4 in its entirety with the following:
 
1.1.2 MAINGATE Demonstration Plan Description
The proposer is to provide a detailed demonstration plan with the proposal.  The final demonstration will include the operation and evaluation of MAINGATE units and capabilities in simulated missions conducted by military, public safety, and coalition personnel.  The venue will be at a CONUS location such as Ft. Benning GA, or Ft. Hunter-Leggitt CA, that provides complex urban and rural tactical environments.  The proposed plan should include periods for equipment checkout and user training, estimated at 4 weeks, followed by independent user operations and assessments, estimate 4 weeks.  A one-day VIP demonstration will also be conducted following the user assessments and should be provided in the proposed plan along with sufficient time for preparation. 

The final demonstration will showcase the comprehensive capabilities of the MAINGATE units and networks.  It will include 13 MAINGATE units (mobile ground and airborne platforms) with the following characteristics providing interoperability among all specified legacy radios, SATCOM, and the GIG infrastructure:
	One HQ Node
	2 Airborne  include all aircraft safety and certification requirements  
	10 SUVs or similar vehicles
	SUVs should contain the MAINGATE node with the following expectations:
	One MAINGATE system will contain the 6 radio interoperability capability
	9 SUVs will contain, at a minimum, 2 radio interoperability capabilities 
	NOTE: specific radio types will be determined during demonstration preparation and execution.  Interoperability for each of the eighteen radio types and one pair of SATCOM radios will be required.
	A minimum of two additional radios for each of the eighteen radio types to be external to the MAINGATE nodes are required for experimentation and evaluation.
	The proposal should describe quality of service types and enhancements to be incorporated 
	The proposer should include procurement of the combined, coalition, first responders/public safety, and similar radios in their proposal.  

NOTE:  The proposer should consider appropriate spare MAINGATE systems, i.e. two, in their proposal to allow the best probability of success of the 13 node demonstration.

The MAINGATE units are to provide reliable voice, video, and other data services (e.g. chat) in the range of tactical environments while under OTM and ATH conditions. They will be configured and operated by military personnel with the possibility of operation by coalition, first responder, and public safety users following a contractor-led training period.

The scenarios conducted by the users will stress-test the MAINGATE units and capabilities to evaluate their ability to meet mission goals. The users will conduct the scenario operations with no contractor interaction and utilize automated network management.  The scenarios will provide for an assessment of the interoperability of the combined, coalition, first responders/public safety, and similar types of radios described in Appendix A.  

The MAINGATE network should be able to support advanced tactical applications critical to modern tactical battlefield needs.  It is anticipated that the transport of real-time video streams from networked analog and digital sensors to dismounted soldiers, maneuver force elements, and tactical operations centers will be a key element.   The MAINGATE network should accommodate a minimum of 20 simultaneous video streams at a rate of 384 kbps as well as other applications such as voice, chat, situational awareness (e.g. FALCON View, C2PC), and network management.

1.1.3 MAINGATE Experimentation Plan Description
The final product of the MAINGATE program will meet a TRL 6 prototype assessment per the guidance in Appendix B (i.e. and informal laboratory testing to a level consistent with operational environments).  The proposal should provide sufficient detail regarding how that assessment will be accomplished to ensure consistency with the guidance provided in Appendix B.

In addition to the TRL 6 assessment, proposers should provide a detailed experimentation plan for the evaluation of developed capabilities and performance.  The plan must include a minimum of two (2) interim field experiments, estimated at 2-4 weeks each, as well as a final experiment.  They are to be conducted at a CONUS location such as Ft. Benning GA, that provides complex urban and rural tactical environments.  The duration and planned activities should facilitate a test-fix-test approach to equipment field checks as the contractors are expected to assess the capabilities and performance of the MAINGATE units under operational conditions, make appropriate changes, and conduct additional experiments with the new configurations.  Each of the two requisite interim experiments will include 13 MAINGATE prototypes including two (2) units hosted on airborne platforms.  Each unit will contain a LAN, WAN, MANET, and legacy network interfaces.  Experimental scenarios will be conducted by contractor teams with some user participation.  The proposed plan must specify the quantity of field experiments to be conducted, their planned dates of occurrence, duration, purpose, and performance metrics to be achieved.  The plan should seek to achieve the final program metrics in a comprehensive scenario early in the program.

The first of the two required interim experiments should occur early in the program.  It should provide for interoperability between at least 11 legacy radios with any mix of radio types (analog and digital).  Nine (9) of the MAINGATE ground mobile units are to support at least one (1) legacy network each, and at least one (1) of the MAINGATE ground mobile units is to support at least two (2) legacy networks.  The proposed plan should include voice and data traffic types and specify the quantities of each.  The experiments should include mobility, LOS, and NLOS/BLOS networking for the MANET.  The MANET should support a mix of unicast and multicast traffic with variable data rates.

The second of the two required interim experiments should occur mid program and provide for greater scope and performance than the first experiment, approaching or matching that of the target program metrics.  It should provide for interoperability between eight (8) radio types plus SATCOM, including digital and analog radio types.  Nine (9) of the MAINGATE ground mobile units are to support at least one (1) legacy network each, and at least one (1) of the MAINGATE ground mobile units is to support at least six (6) legacy networks.  The proposed plan should include voice and data traffic types and specify the quantities of each.  The experiments should include full mobility, LOS, and NLOS/BLOS networking for the MANET as well as SATCOM networking between multiple MAINGATE units.  The MANET should support a mix of unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic with variable data rates.

In addition to the interim experiments, a final experimentation effort must be included in the proposal that provides for the comprehensive assessment of the final MAINGATE configuration, capability, and performance.  The experiments should reflect the scenarios, legacy networks, network traffic, tactical environment, and operational characteristics specified in Appendix A and which are supportive of the TRL 6 assessment.  The experiments will include the simultaneous operation of all 13 MAINGATE units as well as the requisite legacy radios.  Nine (9) MAINGATE units will support two (2) legacy radio networks each, and one (1) MAINGATE unit will support six (6) legacy networks.  The experiments will be conducted to assess interoperability between the 18 radio types plus SATCOM and include the ground mobile, airborne, and HQ MAINGATE units.  As with all field activities, the final experimentation is to be conducted at a location such as Ft. Benning GA that provides complex environments.  The proposer should plan for sufficient time to conduct test-fix-test operations, and allow sufficient lead time for the final demonstration.  If appropriate, the proposer may plan to transition directly from the final experiments to the final demonstration efforts described above.
1.1.4  Government and Contractor Furnished Items for Demonstrations and Experiments

The proposer is requested to plan for an oral presentation in Washington, DC, which include a discussion of all testing and experimental results showing technical maturity of their proposed hardware, based on the TRL guidance in Appendix A, in support of the technical and cost proposal evaluation.  This event will occur not later than 60 days following proposal submittal, or a time negotiated between DARPA and the proposer.  The oral presentation and demonstration are limited to 6 (six) hours each.  
 
The oral presentations should address at a minimum, discussions of TRL assessments, supportive documentation, and determination of the proposed components. Test data for TRL 6 components/subsystems should be documented in sufficient detail and in a form that the review team can assess the testing methods, statistical significance of the tests, and results for each component/subsystem proposed for the MAINGATE node.  This information should follow the guidance given in Appendix A.  This oral presentation time is not for discussion or clarification of the full proposal.  However, the government may ask questions on proposals to help clarify any issues brought up during initial proposal review.
 
The oral presentations and demonstrations should show that the proposer has met the basic program entry criteria to prove the proposed equipment, algorithm, network, etc. are mature enough to enter this program.  The oral presentation also shall address an initial projection of the unit production cost estimate and discuss the path ahead for achieving the projected unit cost. 
See Appendix A for the appropriate TRL level description."

5.  Page 22, Section 4.3.2.1 Volume I, Technical and Management Proposal, Section III, Detailed Proposal Information, G is revised as follows to address EVM:

G.  {3}  Risk assessment and mitigation of key technical approaches and risk-based program management (i.e. EVM). 

6.  Page 27, Evaluation Section 5.1.4 entitled Proposers Experimentation and Demonstration Technical Approach, Schedule, Execution Plan, and Risk Description, replace in its entirety with the following to include EVM: 

5.1.4   Proposers Experimentation and Demonstration Technical Approach, Schedule, Execution Plan, and Risk Description.

<DESC>Modification 3 TO BAA 08-08
Synthetic Aperture LADAR for Tactical Imaging
(SALTI)

(U)  The purpose of Modification 3 to BAA08-08 (SALTI) is to make the following changes:

1.  (U)  Page 5, Section 1.1.1 entitled Phase 4: System Design and Demonstration is replaced in its entirety with the following:

1.1.1 (U) Phase 4: System Design, Development and Validation

(U) During Phase 4, the contractor shall design, develop and test the critical components and subsystems, and then integrate them into a brassboard  system for field testing on a contractor-supplied test aircraft.  These field tests will be designed and executed to validate the program metrics (see Section 1.2 of this BAA) under various atmospheric conditions.  The goal of Phase 4 is to verify the resolution at range requirements cited in program metrics in a configuration compatible with customer needs and able to compensate for aero-optics effects and any atmospheric effects induced by turbulence and atmospheric particulates, i.e., haze.  The intent is to identify any remaining issues and resolve them prior to the Phase 5 POD design and fabrication.   Testing will validate all specified program metrics, as well as validate the SALTI system model predictions using atmospheric parameters obtained during field testing. 

(U) This aforementioned design should be compatible with a military-certifiable POD, but the brassboard does not have to be packaged into a POD for Phase 4 testing and demonstration.  Specifically, the brassboards size, weight and power (SWAP) should show traceability towards a seamless integration into the contractor-proposed POD, but is not expected to completely meet POD SWAP. 

(U) Phase 4 will have four major tasks that will lead to a successful flight testing and demonstration.  They are: (1) POD Preliminary Design; (2) Critical component and sub-systems analysis, development and testing; (3) SAL image processing; and (4) and flight testing in a sample relevant environment. 

(U)  The Contractor shall develop a Preliminary Design for the proposed POD system as well as a detailed systems model and its accompanying analyses to show the proposed systems potential to meet program metrics in a POD configuration.  Based on these analyses, the Contractor shall develop a Systems Requirement Document (SRD) for the proposed POD system that will identify critical technical performance and identify critical technology elements.  Data Collection flights

2.  (U) All references to Conceptual Design should be changed to Preliminary Design.  Specifically,
	
	a.  Page 5, Section 1.1.1., second and third paragraph
	b.  Page 6, Section 1.1.1.1
	c.  Page 6, Section 1.1.1.1.1
	d.  Page 7, Section 1.1.1.1.4
	d.  Page 7, Section 1.1.1.2.1
	e.  Page 7, Section 1.1.1.3.1

3. (U)  Page 6, Section 1.1.1.1.2 entitled System Performance and Signature/Imaging Modeling and Analysis, is replaced in its entirety with the following:

1.1.1.1.2 (U) System Performance and Signature/Imaging Modeling and Analysis

(U) A complete systems model is required to predict sensor performance in the presence of atmospheric effects for both the Phase 4 test aircraft and final POD configuration.  This model should include aero-optics effects and those effects induced by atmospheric turbulence and particulates, i.e., Haze.   For all predictive analyses, the Contractor shall use typical atmospheric visibilities such as 10, 25 and 50 statute miles, and the 0.2x, 1x and 5x Huffnagle-Valley 5/7 atmospheric models ,  (see figure 1 for comparison of these models against Korean atmospheric data. 
 
(U) Figure 1 Multiples of Huffnagle-Valley Model Compared To Korean Turbulence
 
(U) The Contractor shall demonstrate a systems model, validated by laboratory and field testing results from the previous SALTI Phases as well as data taken during Phase 4.  This model must, as a minimum, include objective platform-based environmental factors.  Signature/imaging models will be developed to predict sensor performance based on sensor platforms and targets expected to be seen during field testing and validation.  These should include both intra-beam and sub-swath image prediction.  Both the performance and signature models will be delivered to the Government at appropriate periodic intervals during contract.    

4.  (U) Page 6, Section 1.1.1.1.4 entitled Data Collection Flights is replaced in its entirety with the following:

1.1.1.1.4 (U) Data Collection Flights

(U) Flight tests of a SAL sensor shall be conducted during Phase 4 to validate SALTI signature/imaging and system models, as well as verifying relevant program metrics can be met.   Key to this validation is formation of SAL images using existing/upgraded SALTI from Phase 3 and preceding SALTI testing.  The Contractor shall identify potential ranges for field testing and demonstration selection for unambiguous validation of SALTI models, predictions and program metrics.  The Contractor also will identify any safety and testing issues, e.g., eye safety, flight safety, that need resolution and will work with the Government to resolve before flight testing.  The Contractor shall develop a draft test plan for a set of proposed testing and demonstration for unambiguous validation of SALTI models, predictions and program metrics, and submit it to the Government for approval prior to any field tests.  This test plan shall include proposed measurements from which the strength of atmospheric turbulence along the path and the integrated extinction due to Haze can be estimated. This data will also be used for improving SALTI image formation and processing algorithms. 

(U) As noted above, atmospheric characteristics / ground truth data taken during Phase 4 field testing shall be used in the referenced SALTI model to predict system performance and compared to SALTI measurements obtained during said tests.  The goal is to show good agreement between experiment, models and the relevant program metrics.  The Contractor will identify all ground truthing requirements, and is responsible for obtaining this equipment for the Phase 4 field trials.  If such equipment is available from the government, the Contractor can propose its use as GFE in said field trials.  However, the government is under no obligation to provide, and the Contractor needs to determine alternate sources.  

5.  (U)  Page 7, Section 1.1.1.2.1 entitled Critical Technology Identification is replaced in its entirety with the following:

1.1.1.2.1 (U) Critical Technology Identification

(U) Based on the Preliminary Design for the proposed POD configuration, the Contractor shall identify and document the critical technologies, components and sub-systems, necessary to achieve the required performance specified in the program metrics section.   Identification and documentation shall be provided at a level sufficient to allow detailed evaluation of these subsystems by expert reviewers.  All claims to prior performance demonstration of components (ie. laser systems, detectors, etc) shall be documented.  The Contractor shall benchmark in detail the State-of-the-Art (SOA) for each and provide documentation supporting SOA claims, identify the technical challenges (if any) for maturing it to the level necessary for the SALTI Phase 4 brassboard integration, and outline the WBS tasking and budget (if any) needed to meet these challenges on the proposed Phase 4 schedule.  The Contractor shall consider as a minimum, but not limited to, the following areas as critical to SALTI:  lasers, circulators, detectors, pointing and tracking, payload stabilization, aero-optics effects, vibration and motion compensation, auto-focus algorithms, atmospheric and aero-optics effects compensation, signal processing, and data acquisition and storage systems.  Such documentation is especially vital for critical path items such as laser systems, for which sufficient detail must be provided to allow evaluation of laser concepts by Government experts.  For example, laser system design should be specified at sufficient level to allow evaluation of projected performance parameters such as power, linewidth, beam quality, and electrical efficiency in the presence of physical processes that constrain these parameters.  All claims with regard to previous demonstration(s) must be substantiated in detail. 

(U) As noted above, the brassboards SWAP should show traceability towards a seamless integration into the contractor-proposed POD, but is not expected to completely meet POD SWAP.  The Contractor shall provide a road map for how all mismatched critical components and subsystems can be fixed, changed, or modified to meet POD SWAP requirements.  The Contractor will have to demonstrate operation of all critical components and subsystems individually and in the integrated brassboard in the laboratory before flight testing can occur.

6.  (U) Page 18, Section 4.3.1.1 Volume I, Technical and Management Proposal, Section III, Detailed Proposal Information, G is replaced in its entirety  to address EVM:

(U) Management Approach:  Describe management approach and identify formal teaming agreements that are required to execute this program.  The plan should include an organization chart and a summary that describes programmatic relationship of team members, their unique capabilities, task responsibilities, and the teaming strategy among the team members.  Additionally, describe the approach for system engineering, assessing and managing cost, technical, and schedule risk to include commercially acceptable Earned Value Management techniques, the method of assessing and managing progress towards achieving programmatic goals and metrics, the extent of participation of small and disadvantaged businesses, and use of a  secure Integrated Digital Environment.

7.  (U) Page 22, Section 4.4.1 entitled Proposal Date, inner envelope, change the ATTN line to read as follows: 

ATTN:  STO/Dr. L. B. Stotts, Room 328.

8.   (U)  Page 23, Section 5.1.1 entitled Overall Scientific and Technical Merit, is replaced in its entirety with the following:

 (U) OVERALL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERIT

(U) The proposers Overall Scientific and Technical Merit will be evaluated to determine the extent that the effort will meet the program objectives and goals.  Specifically, the proposer must show a credible technical approach to achieving the program goals; objectives and performance metrics (see Section 1.2).   The four critical sub-factors to be evaluated in assessing the credability of the technical approach are the technology SOA assessment maturity and validation levels of the proposed SALTI model, which should include all degrading system effects, the system engineering analysis of proposed approach, and credibility of proposed cost and schedule. At a minimum, the following items should be provided for evaluation:

	(U) SOA:  The proposal shall benchmark the SOA for critical component and sub-system for the Preliminary Design, identify the technical challenges (if any) for maturing it to the level necessary for the SALTI Phase 4 brassboard integration, and outline the WBS tasking and budget (if any) needed to meet these challenges on the proposed Phase 4 schedule.   All technical claims made in the proposal will be expected to have accompanying data to verify such claims, with sufficient description on how measurements were made, under what conditions, and all the values of the relevant ancillary parameters and or metrics, at the time of the measurements.

	(U) SALTI Systems Model:  The proposer shall describe the SOA SALTI system model used in developing the proposal and outline how it was validated by laboratory and field testing results from the previous SALTI Phases.  This model should include aero-optics and atmospheric turbulence effects, and their compensation, clearly identified in model.

	(U) Prediction of SALTI performance:  A complete systems model will be used to predict sensor performance in the presence of atmospheric effects for proposed designs associated with both the Phase 4 test aircraft and final POD configuration.  A complete system link budget should be included in the proposal for both the Phase 4 testing and POD design.  The system engineering analyses should include aero-optics effects and those effects induced by atmospheric turbulence and particulates, i.e., Haze.   For proposal, the Contractor shall use typical atmospheric visibilities such as 10, 25 and 50 statute miles, and the 0.2x, 1x and 5x Huffnagle-Valley 5/7 atmospheric models2, 3.   Power Spectrum Density data for the Phase 4 test aircraft and the expected AF fighter should be identified and used in this analyses.

	(U) Performance/Cost/Schedule:  The proposer will be evaluated on creditability of achieving the programs goals, objectives and program metrics within the cost and schedule.  All subcontractor WBS tasking and budget should be reflected in the proposers overall Master Schedule and Budget.  

(U) The contactor should demonstrate a clear and broad understanding of all the critical technical issue in making a SALTI a deployed capability in the USAF, and the degrees of technical innovation in the technical approach should be clearly articulated. 

9.  (U) Page 24, Section 5.1.3 entitled Management Approach, is replaced in its entirety with the following:

(U)	The proposal must show effective and responsible management of both people and information resources needed to execute the program.  Management plans must accommodate Government visibility into key technical activities, interaction with key personnel, and single point responsibility for contract performance.  Technical, administrative, and financial accountability must be evident from the management and reporting structure.  Roles of the prime Contractor and all other participants should be delineated and adequately described and formal agreements documented.  Any participation by or use of Government personnel and property must be identified.  Intellectual property issues must be adequately addressed.  In particular, the following items will be considered and evaluated:
(U)	System Engineering Plan and management approach
(U)	Cost Risk assessment and management approach
(U)	Technical Risk assessment and management approach
(U)	Schedule Risk assessment and management approach
(U)	Method of assessing and managing progress towards achieving programmatic goals and metrics
(U)	Use of a secure Integrated Environment
(U)   Earned Value Management (EVM) and management approach

10.  (U) Page 27, Section  6.2.1 entitled Security, change the Attn: line to read as follows: 

ATTN:  STO/Dr. L. B. Stotts, Room 328.

Contracting Office Address:Environmental Protection Agency, Acquisition and Assistance Branch, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Blvd., MCC-10J, Chicago, IL 60604
Description:
NAICS Code: 493110   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to procure warehouse services for the management of its equipment and supply inventories located at its warehouse facilities in San Francisco and Los Angeles, CA, using negotiated contracting procedures under Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  This procurement is a total set-aside for SBA-certified small business concerns under the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) program only.  A separate solicitation will be made available within 30 days from the publication date of this notice.
This requirement is for the management of equipment and supplies owned by EPA Region 9, for use by its Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The contractor will be responsible for providing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week readiness of all materials and equipment in the warehouse in support of the EPA On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) and its environmental response contractor network. The contractor will be required to perform inventory control, track and schedule necessary maintenance according to manufacturer?s recommendations, and allow for one hour availability of vehicles, equipment, or supplies when requested by an OSC. Other than minor maintenance or cleaning, the contractor will not be required to perform scheduled maintenance of equipment or any major cleaning or calibrations. The contractor will use an electronic system already in place to track inventories at these facilities.
The San Francisco warehouse is located within the City of San Francisco and is approximately 6000 square feet. It contains a response vehicle and a trailer, electronic or scientific equipment, and consumable supplies used at the sites of environmental cleanups. The Los Angeles warehouse holds a  vehicle, equipment, and supplies. The warehouse will be at a location to be determined within the Los Angeles metropolitan area and is anticipated to be approximately 6000 square feet in area. 
The contract will be placed by Region 5, located in Chicago, IL, and administered by Region 9, located in San Francisco.  The EPA expects to award the contract on or about September 30, 2008 with the period of performance to begin December 1, 2008.  The contract will be a performance-based, fixed price (with cost reimbursable line items) type of contract.  The contract will have a one year base and four one year options. The majority of work under this contract will be performed at the warehouse locations; some incidental travel in the performance of the contract may be required in the immediate area (post office, etc.).  In emergency situations, as determined by the OSC or PO, it is anticipated that delivery of emergency response vehicles, equipment, and supplies to emergency response locations will be required. 
The contractor will be required to submit all personnel working under this contract for security clearance under HSPD-12 procedures, details of which can be found at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/forum/oct2007/epass.pdf

This information is proprietary to Man Diesel Inc. (Paxman). The Government did not procure this information, or the rights to use this information, under the original contract. Therefore, it is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate only with Man Diesel Inc, (Paxman) or concerns successful as stated above. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within 3 calendar days from the day this notice is posted. The information that must be submitted includes: (1) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics) and/or (2) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufactured for the Government or the Original Equipment Manufacturer. This data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the information relative to the above requirements. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bona fide capability of meet the requirements. Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall NOT be considered for this acquisition. The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned. The Government does NOT intend to pay for information solicited. This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and HSAM 3006.302-1. For information regarding this acquisition, contact the Contracting officials listed herein.
