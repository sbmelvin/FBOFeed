<DESC>The USMC has a requirement for an interim capability for FLIR, EO, LTD and LST for their Lot 14-21 F/A-18D aircraft.  The proposed solution is to integrate the AN/AAQ-28(v)(3) LITENING AT targeting pod on the F/A-18D aircraft.  An aircraft modification kit was developed to allow integration between the aircraft and the LITENING pod.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement for the integration and purchase of approximately 30 LITENING integration.kits.  The LITENING targeting pod is already in use by USMC AV-8B aircraft, and a limited number of F/A-18D and F/A-18A+ aircraft.  Rapid integration of the LITENING pod with the F/A-18D provides the USMC with a limited A/G LITENING AT pod capability.  The LITENING Pod will be integrated with the F/A-18D weapons systems to provide this interim capability while maintaining ATFLIR compatibility and minimizing required hardware and software changes to both the LITENING pod and the F/A18D aircraft.  NAVAIR intends to place a sole source order under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Boeing Company, P. O. Box 516, St. Louis, MO 63166-0516.  This requirement is in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) intends to conduct a bottom trawl survey of the groundfish resources of the continental shelf and slope of the United States West Coast region.  Four commercial trawl-fishing vessels will be chartered to carry out this survey, operating two at a time.  The first set of vessels will commence survey operations on or around May 23, 2005 and complete survey operations approximately sixty-seven (67) days later on or around July 28, 2005.  The second set of the two selected vessels will commence survey operations on or around August, 15, 2005 and complete survey operations approximately sixty-seven (67) days later on or around October 20, 2005.  The charters will begin in Newport, OR and end in San Diego, CA.  Each charter period will be broken into five to six cruise legs of seven to ten days each with a two to three day port call between legs for refueling, re-provisioning, personnel changes, and landing the catch.  A minimum of 47 working days at sea will be required for each charter, not including port calls, time spent running to and from towing sites, or days when operations must be suspended due to bad weather, break downs, or other contingencies.  Each vessel will conduct an independent survey of the shelf and slope zone from 30 to 700 fathoms, extending from the Canadian border around Cape Flattery, Washington to the Mexican border near San Diego, CA.  Survey stations will be designated in the sampling manual to representatively sample this range of depths, and will be randomly pre-selected within an INPFC area and depth strata.  Each of the vessels will be allocated approximately 180 of these stations.  An average of four to five tows will be conducted per day.   

Trawl gear to be used during this survey will be supplied by the NWFSC.  The Government furnished trawls, rigging, and accessories will be of a type commonly used in slope and shelf fisheries, scaled to fit vessels ranging from 425 to 800 horsepower.  The vessel’s main engine must be rated at a minimum continuous horsepower of 425 while not being rated more than 800 horsepower.  The vessel must be capable of towing the experimental gear at a minimum speed of 2.2 knots at a fishing depth of 700 fathoms.  The vessel must be able to maintain a cruising speed of at least eight (8) knots in low sea states.  Trawl cables runs must be directly from the winches to the towing blocks.  The vessel must be at least sixty (60) feet in length and must be seaworthy and suitable for trawling operations in the above region during the season indicated.  The vessel must be completely rigged for stern trawling and must also allow for thru-hull cabling for acoustic transducers that will be installed in drydock.  At the end of the charter period, transducers will be removed and the perforation will be secured with two caps.  The working deck must be a clear, open space 12’ x 8’ for location of a NWFSC-supplied 8’ x 4’ sorting table.  Vessel must be equipped with a working railing height of no less than 38 to 42 inches (OSHA).  There must be berthing accommodations for the vessel crew and three (3) scientists, one or more of which may be female.  

Four awards will be made based on a single solicitation, two of which will have a one year option year.  Awards will be evaluated based on Vessel Characteristics, Vessel Configuration, Vessel’s Commercial Fishing History, Master/Crew Work Experience, Offeror’s Qualifications and Desirable Items.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 05-14 Integrated Battle Command; CLOSING DATE: 07 Feb 2006; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS: 12:00 Noon local Arlington, VA time on 24 March 2005.  POC:  Dr.  John G. Allen, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA05-14@darpa.mil; Web:  http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/IBC/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, design, and testing that directly supports the Integrated Battle Command (IBC) program. The IBC program will develop transformational decision-aid technologies to enhance the capability of commanders and staffs to plan and conduct joint effects-based operations in future campaigns. The decision aids will apply over the full continuum of near-simultaneous missions required in a campaign, to include major combat operations as well as various security, stability and reconstruction operations. 

Objectives: The decision aids will assist the commander and staff in generating, assessing and visualizing the consequences of employing diplomatic, military, information operations and economic (DIME) actions, singularly or in combinations, to achieve effects against the adversary’s political, military (air, land and sea), economic, social, information and infrastructure (PMESII) systems. The decision aids will also assist the commander and staff in constructing, visualizing and evaluating campaign plans that exploit the impact of multi-dimensional effects and the interaction among effects. 

Technical Areas: The program will be conducted sequentially.
•	Phase 1: Basal Capability Development will develop a minimal suite of tools with the functionality to visualize complex information and to predict and analyze action/effect relationships.  The resulting capability will be evaluated by experimentation.
•	Phase 2: Comprehensive Capability Development will expand the functionality of the Basal Capability to include the capability for generating effects-based plans; it will also refine and complete development of the overall capability. The resulting capability will be evaluated by experimentation.

Specifically, Phase 1 will produce a basal capability with two tool kits: an Action/Effects Prediction and Analysis Tool Kit and a Visualization and Computer Interaction Tool Kit.  The Action/Effects Prediction and Analysis Tool Kit will aid command center personnel in investigating the interactions between a nation’s PMESII systems and their susceptibility to DIME actions. The tools set will be bi-directional (action-to-effects or effect-to-actions) and bi-sided (model the adversary coalition/partners as well as the US coalition/partners).  The Visualization and Computer Interaction Tool Kit will enable command center personnel to develop complex transforms and displays from existing databases and information/knowledge sources as well as to visualize the results of using the Action/Effects Prediction and Analysis Tool Kit by displaying Action/Effect linkages and their significance. 

Phase 2 will expand the functionality to include an Effects-based Planning Tool Kit to aid commanders and staffs in generating effects-based campaign plans. During Phase 2, the capabilities of the Visualization and Computer Interaction Tool Kit and the Action/Effects Prediction and Analysis Tool Kit developed in Phase 1, will be expanded and enhanced based on the experiments performed in Phase 1, and the need to support and interact with the Effects-based Planning Tool Kit.  

Go/No-Go Criteria: Contractor performance on this program will be determined by the use of Go/No-Go Criteria. The technologies developed under this program will be evaluated using human-in-the-loop experiments to estimate the value of performance metrics. The primary metrics are:
•	Net Number of Favorable Effects Achieved
•	Number of Predicted Unfavorable Actions and Effects.
Specifically, we are interested in the increase in the value of these metrics due to employing the tools in contrast to not employing them.  Thus, experiments will be conducted using two teams of players operating in parallel; one team will be advantaged with the automated decision support tools.  Multiple teams of command center personnel will be employed in multiple experiment trials. A panel of government experts, as well as simulation will be used to evaluate and characterize the individual actions and effects.

For Phase 1 and 2 of the program, the Go/No-Go Criteria are achievement of the following metric goals:

Program Metrics	Phase 1 Goal	Phase 2 Goal
Net Number of Favorable Effects Achieved	10:1	100:1
Number of Predicted Unfavorable Actions and Effects	10:1	100:1

The goals are defined as the ratio of the values of the metrics, measured for teams of command center personnel employing the tools, compared to teams not employing the tools.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA on or before 12:00 Noon local Arlington, VA time on 24 March 2005. 

DARPA will employ an electronic upload process for proposal submissions. Proposers may find submission guidance at http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicitations/IBC/index.htm. Organizations must register at http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa to propose. Each proposal submitted requires a separate registration, so organizations wishing to submit multiple proposals should complete a single registration for each proposal. The deadline for registration is 10 March 2005 (2 weeks before the proposals are due). By registering, the Proposer has made no commitment to submit.  Proposal submissions must be unclassified. 

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, and Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiations. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Each proposal will be evaluated on its merit as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.  Proposals will be evaluated on the following factors, in order of importance:  (a) General Technical Approach; (b) Technical Approach to Action/Effect Prediction and Analysis Tool Kit; (c) Technical Approach to Visualization and Computer Interaction Tool Kit; (d) Technical Approach to Effects-based Planning Tool Kit; (e) Technical Approach to Experimentation; (f) Management and Program Plan; (g) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; and (h) Cost Realism. In accordance with FAR 35.016(e), the primary basis for selecting proposals for award shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate as described herein.  Proposals may be evaluated as they are received, or they may be collected and periodically reviewed.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated PIP available at www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov, which provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND FUNDING
The mission of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop those technologies into important, radically new military capabilities.  In addition, DSO is looking for research ideas and areas that might lead to innovations in science and engineering.  To this end, DSO is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. 
Proposals may be either basic or applied research.  However, in all cases, proposers should demonstrate that their proposed effort is aimed at high-risk/high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making, in the 5-10 year timeframe, revolutionary rather than incremental improvements to national security, including emerging threats and operational challenges.   Proposals that are not within the topical areas described below may be considered out of scope and not evaluated.  Likewise, proposals that are the integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered out of scope and will not be evaluated.  
Multiple awards are anticipated.  The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposers include a Phase I of 12 to 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. 
This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  
TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS OF INTEREST TO DSO
This section describes the general technical interests of DSO.  Please note that while the topics are organized by traditional disciplines, interdisciplinary proposals are encouraged.  Regardless of the technical area, the ultimate success of a proposal is based on the specific technical idea(s) advanced within these areas and especially the uniqueness of the proposed approach.  Consequently, proposing within one of these topic areas is not sufficient to make a compelling case for funding.  For this reason, white papers are strongly suggested before submitting a full proposal.  (See below)

Special Focus Areas
From time to time, DARPA will publish addenda to this BAA that will highlight particular areas of interest.  It is highly recommended that potential proposers look periodically for these updates.  Addenda will have deadlines for submission of white papers and proposals that are different from the deadline in this BAA.  Under Addenda, the technical content for a submission as well as the overall structure of the proposed effort may also differ.  DARPA will not establish a distribution list for automatic distribution of these addenda.  Any specific instructions or criteria in a published addendum will take precedence over this BAA in response to that addendum only.  
Other Technical Areas
Ideas outside of the advertised focus areas will be considered in scope only if the proposers can demonstrate that they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the technical interests of the office.  Proposals that integrate existing technologies or products into systems generally do not fall within the purview of DSO and are likely to be rejected.  
WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS
Before proposers put together a full proposal, it is highly recommended (though not required) that they submit a white paper in response to the BAA.  This white paper should clearly state the uniqueness of the idea presented in the context of existing state of the art in the technical area of interest.  Demonstrating that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state of the art and that their proposed effort will make significant improvements therein is essential for a successful proposal.  The white paper should also describe the proposed approach and explain why it is unique.  Further, the proposer should demonstrate an understanding of the payoff of the technical idea, especially in terms of how it might make a difference to Defense capabilities.  Key milestones expected in the effort should be described.  Also, a brief discussion of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members should be provided.  Finally, an estimate of the program costs and duration should be included.  White papers should not be longer than 8 pages; however, shorter white papers that can cover the content above are strongly encouraged.
Procedures have been put in place that will help proposers to rapidly determine the applicability of their proposal to DARPA/DSO and to help develop promising ideas into formal proposals with a reasonably high probability of funding.  Proposers may recommend a program manager to review their proposals based on prior discussions and/or information on the DSO web site.
A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/ has been set up to facilitate the submission of white papers.  This site will allow proposers to fill in contact information and upload a white paper document in either Word or PDF format.  It will provide a method by which proposers can track their submissions.  White paper submissions may also be made by attachment to an e-mail sent to BAA05-19@darpa.mil (Word 97 or higher is recommended).  Embedded text and Postscript are also acceptable.  Note: if the website is not used then the body of the e-mail and the attachment must include name, mailing address, phone number, and fax number of the proposer.  If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information.  (If proposers choose not to use e-mail, U.S. mail may be used.  White papers will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.)  Within two weeks of receipt of the white paper, the proposer will be informed of receipt of the white paper, provided a log number and given both a technical and administrative point of contact.  The formal recommendation about whether a formal proposal is recommended will be made as soon as possible.  However, the exact time for response will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the number of white papers received.  Please note, this recommendation and any additional feedback provided is for the benefit of the proposer and following these recommendations is not a guarantee that the full proposal will be funded.  All full proposal submissions will be evaluated regardless of the disposition of the white paper.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND DEADLINES
Proposals may be submitted and received at any time until the final proposal deadline of 4:00 PM EST February 7, 2006.  Proposals will be evaluated against the criteria set forth in this solicitation, and an offeror will be notified either that: (1) the proposal has been selected for funding, or (2) the proposal has not been selected for funding.  Proposers may elect to have their proposal withdrawn from consideration at any time during the evaluation process.  If a formal request is not made, DARPA will assume that continued evaluation is desired.  One copy only of proposals that are not selected for funding will be retained for administrative purposes.  
The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, including those that do not strictly adhere to the division of technical and cost sections.  The Government also reserves the right to fund proposals in phases with options for continued work at the end of one or more of the phases.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Other Transaction," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. The offeror must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227).
FORMAT AND CONTENT OF FULL PROPOSAL
The descriptions contained in this section are to help proposers ensure that proposals have sufficiently detailed information to be evaluated.  Proposals not conforming to the instructions of this section may not, at the discretion of the Government, be evaluated.    Full proposals shall consist of two volumes, technical and cost.  A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0519 has been established to facilitate the submission of full proposals electronically.  This site will allow proposers to fill in contact information and upload a full proposal created with the requirements listed below in either Word or PDF format.  Note:  if the website is not used, please use the U.S. mail system or the BAA e-mail account.  If submitting via e-mail, the body of the e-mail and the attachment must include name, mailing address, phone number, and fax of the proposer.  If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information.   If offerors choose to submit by U.S. mail, they should submit one (1) original and three (3) copies of the full proposal to the address shown below.  Proposals will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.  Both volumes should be included as a single document when uploading to the website.
Volume 1: Technical. 
The technical volume is limited to a maximum of 30 pages including all figures, references, tables, charts, cover sheet, and appendices and consists of the following sections: 
a)	Executive Summary (two pages or less);
b)	Technical section that clearly describes the innovation of the work to be accomplished, specific metrics for the effort, the risks to achieving those metrics and approaches for mitigation of those risks.  All milestones should be clearly delineated, especially those early (12 to 18 months) milestones that are critical to demonstration of the concept or approach.  Supporting rationale for performance enhancements should be included.  The perceived need for this research and the potential impact on the DoD should be described, and a Statement of Work (SOW) that summarizes critical tasks to be accomplished should be presented;
c)	Time-phased schedule-milestone chart;
d)	Summary of relevant prior work;
e)	Brief description of applicable facilities and equipment; 
f)	Short resumes of key individuals.  The level of effort and specific roles and qualifications of key individuals should be included.  If the team is large (greater than 3 separate entities), a management plan for coordination of the effort should also be included; and
g)	Current and pending support (award title, amount, period of performance, and degree of overlap with this proposal).
Proposers are cautioned not to submit supporting material (articles, CDs, etc.) as these will not be accepted and will not be used in evaluation of the proposal.   
Volume 2: Cost. 
The cost volume shall contain the following: 
a)	Cover sheet to include: (1) BAA number; (2) Technical area; (3) Lead organization submitting proposal; (4) Type of business, selected among the following categories: "LARGE BUSINESS," "SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS," "WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS," "SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED," "OTHER SMALL BUSINESS," "HBCU," "MI," "OTHER EDUCATIONAL,” or "OTHER NONPROFIT"; (5) Contractor’s reference number (if any); (6) Other team members (if applicable) and type of business for each; (7) Proposal title; (8) Technical point of contact to include: salutation, last name, first name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available), electronic mail (if available); (9) Administrative point of contact to include: salutation, last name, first name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available), and electronic mail (if available);  (10) Award instrument requested: cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF); cost-contract--no fee; cost sharing contract--no fee; or other type of procurement contract (specify), grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction; (11) Place(s) and period(s) of performance; (12) Total proposed cost separated by basic award and option(s) (if any); (13) Name, address, and telephone number of the offeror’s cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) administration office or Office of Naval Research; (14) Name, address, and telephone number of the offeror’s cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit office; (15) Date proposal was prepared, (16) DUNS, TIN, CAGE CODE; and (17) All subcontractors proposal backup documentation to include items 1-16 above, as applicable and available.
b)	Detailed cost breakdown to include:  (1) total program cost broken down by major cost items (direct labor, subcontracts, materials, travel, other direct costs, overhead charges, etc.), and (2) an itemization of major subcontracts (labor, travel, materials and other direct costs) and equipment purchases.  Where the effort consists of multiple portions that could reasonably be partitioned for purposes of funding, these should be identified as options with separate cost estimates for each.
c)	Supporting cost and pricing information in sufficient detail to substantiate the summary cost estimates in b) above.  Include a description of the method used to estimate costs and supporting documentation.  Note:  “cost or pricing data” as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 2.101 shall be required if the offeror’s proposal is for a procurement contract award of $550,000 or greater unless the offeror requests an exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data.  “Cost or pricing data” are not required if the offeror proposes an award instrument other than a procurement contract (e.g., a grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction).  The requirements for submission of “cost or pricing data” are specified in FAR Subpart 15.403-4 (see http://www.arnet.gov/far).
OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION
Teaming and Team Composition
Teaming is encouraged, especially when interdisciplinary approaches to a problem are required.
Proposals may include, or be led by, foreign firms and/or personnel provided all export control laws and U.S. national security requirements are adhered to in the conduct of the effort and that the work relating to the foreign firm or personnel is unclassified.  The onus of understanding and complying with export control rests with the proposer, not the Government.
Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and to join others in submitting proposals.  
Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  Consequently, all offerors and proposed subcontractors must, therefore, affirm whether they are providing scientific, engineering and technical assistance (SETA) or similar support to any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract numbers.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined at FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.
Technology Transition
Proposers are strongly encouraged to engage commercial and military end-users and commercial manufacturers from the program inception.  The engagement of these communities also helps ensure that the various technologies being developed will be commercially viable (cost effective, manufacturability, etc.) and available to the military.  Thus, proposals are strongly encouraged to include/involve the user-community that intends to bring the technology to practice as a result of this research.  This relationship encourages the participation of researchers, end-users and manufacturers as collective contributors to the technology definition, implementation, and performance evaluation.
Proprietary Information
All proprietary information should be marked on both the white paper and the full proposal.  It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.  Standard proprietary disclaimers notwithstanding, proposals may be reviewed by non-Government technical experts who have signed a nondisclosure agreement with DARPA, unless the specific phrase “TO BE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ONLY” appears on the cover sheet.  In any case, personnel under exclusive contract with DARPA who have completed the appropriate nondisclosure agreements will handle the proposals for administrative purposes. 
Security
Proposals and white papers may contain classified information or data (up to the level of Top Secret/SCI). HOWEVER, DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED WHITE PAPERS OR FULL PROPOSALS BY EMAIL OR VIA ONLINE SUBMISSION SYSTEMS.  Offerors that intend to include classified information or data in their proposals should contact DARPA security at the address identified in this BAA (or alternatively, the point-of-contact for this BAA) for guidance and direction in advance of proposal preparation.  Offerors must have existing approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose.
Guidance for Classified Information and Data
The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under a BAA will be unclassified.  In the event that a proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal, the following information is applicable.

Security Classification guidance on DD Form 254 will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award.  Proposers choosing to submit a classified proposal must first receive permission from the Original Classification Authority to use their information in applying to this BAA.  An applicable classification guide should be submitted to ensure that the proposal is protected appropriately.  For instructions on submitting Classified White Papers or Full Proposals, contact Security & Intelligence Directorate (SID) Classification Management at (571) 218-4841.
Research Involving Human Use
Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the DoD Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm).  All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects.  This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances.  These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.
 For proposals involving “greater than minimal risk” to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA.  For proposals that are forecasted to involve “greater than minimal risk” after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission.  More information on applicable federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).
EVALUATION CRITERIA
The following evaluation criteria are listed in order of decreasing importance.  Proposals that are deemed unsatisfactory in Scientific and Technical Merit will not be evaluated further.
Scientific and Technical Merit of the Proposal
Proposers must demonstrate that their proposal is innovative and unique, that the technical approach is sound, that they have an understanding of critical technical issues and risk, and that they have a plan for mitigation of those risks.  A significant improvement in capability or understanding above the state of the art must be demonstrated.  All milestones must be clearly and quantitatively described.
Value to Defense
Proposers must demonstrate the potential of successful research to radically change military capability or improve national security with a clear statement of the goals of their program and a quantitative comparison with existing technology.
Capability of the Personnel and Facilities to Perform the Proposed Effort
Proposers must demonstrate that their team has the necessary background and experience to perform this project.  The balance of the technical capabilities of the team must match that required in the program plan.  The relevant experience of key personnel must be sufficient to provide confidence that the proposers can accomplish their objectives.  Proposers must demonstrate that the combined facilities of the team are sufficient to accomplish the objectives of the proposal.
Cost Realism
Costs of the proposal must be reasonable and provide a high value to the Government.

 The Department of Homeland Security is interested in acquiring a commercial off the shelf automated performance management (e-performance) software system. As such, the system should require little, or no, customizations.  The government is not interested in having any product built or “ramped up” to meet the technical and functional requirements identified in the attached solicitation document. The system is for use by the Department of Homeland Security.  The Government contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation.  Each offer submitted should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint, as contract award may be based on initial offers received, without discussions. The contract duration consists of a base period (one year), and two (2) one-year option periods, with the total contract duration consisting of 3 years. In order for an offer to be considered “acceptable” under this solicitation offerors must provide pricing for the base year and all option years. Definition of terms: the Base Year is the period of one year from the date of contract award through twelve (12) months.  Option year One is the period of one year to run in succession to the Base Year. Option Year Two is the period of one year to run in succession to Option Year One. All offerors wishing to submit proposals are required to be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR).  If not already registered, vendors should register immediately with CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Contractors are required to have a Dun & Bradstreet number (DUNS) in order to be registered in the CCR database. Failure to register may make an offeror ineligible for award.

<DESC>Due to an error in the initial web-posting of the Solar and Heliospheric Physics Program Element (Appendix C.2) of ROSS 2004, there is confusion about the due date for proposal submission.  Two different dates were being shown on the web posting at http://research.hq.nasa.gov/:  February 11, 2005, and February 22, 2005.  Because there is a possibility that many people have been working towards that later due date, we formally extend the proposal due date for this program element to February 22, 2005.  Any proposer who has already submitted a proposal and would like to take advantage of this extra time and submit a revised proposal is asked to send an email to the SYS-EYFUS help desk (proposals@hq.nasa.gov) alerting them to the fact that a REPLACEMENT proposal will be sent in by February 22, 2005. The due date for Program Element C.2, Solar and Heliospheric Physics, is changed to February 22, 2005. Further information about this Program Element is available from Dr. William J. Wagner, Earth-Sun System Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546-0001; Telephone: (202) 358-0911; FAX: (202) 358-3987;  E-mail: William.J.Wagner@nasa.gov. This is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 6.102 (d) (2). Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov, Grants.gov, or at both sites, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposal selected pursuant to this announcement.

Mullen, Contracting Officer  Title: Conference Support and Proceeding for Alternative Mobile Air Conditioning             Summitt with the California Air Resources  Board (ARB) in Sacramento, CA The United States Environmental Protection Agency, under Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to: Name of Contractor: California Air Resources Board 1001 I Street Sacramento, CA 95812 Contact: Alberto  Ayala, Ph. D. Manager, Emission Control Technology Research P: 916-327-2952 F: 916-322-4357 The requirement and justification are stated below:  Background  Developments in mobile air conditioning technology have a large impact on global climate. HCFC-134a has been the predominate refrigerant in  automotive air conditioners since the phase-out of CFCs.  HFC-134a is a potent greenhouse gas.  Alternative refrigerants, namely CO2 and HFC-152b, are being considered for air conditioners.  These refrigerants not only have much lower global warming potentials, but they have the potential to  achieve a higher efficiency rating.  This means they would also reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from the automobile engine.  Objective This project shall enable industry and public experts to come together to work on identifying solutions and environmentally preferable alternatives.  The objective of the summit is to provide a forum where the newest alternative technology developments can be elaborated and shared.  The conference shall be attended by air-conditioning component manufacturers involved in the development of next-generation systems, automobile manufacturers  planning compliance with national and international air-conditioning regulations, vehicle service associations advocating professional service, research and development personnel hoping to coordinating research and development efforts, and policymakers seeking to become more informed.  This  conference is directly applicable to CPPD's mission. By providing funding, EPA (1) ensures that this vital conference will proceed and (2) assists in the development and promulgation of new environmental technologies with the potential to greatly reduce mobile air conditioning's contribution to  global climate change.  Deliverables EPA deliverables shall be EPA sponsor representation, distribution of EPA Mobile Air Conditioning Partnership materials, two full copies of conference proceedings that supply EPA that supply EPA with the most up-to-date information available regarding global  climate change and MAC, multimedia in the form of (2) conference CDs and (1) searchable directory of Mobile Air Conditioning experts, and registration and fees for six EPA employees at the conference. Justification for Procuring from CARB  California's Legislature established the Air Resources  Board (ARB) in 1967 to: 1. Attain and maintain healthy air quality.  2. Conduct research into the causes of and solutions to air pollution.  3. Systematically attack the serious problem caused by motor vehicles, which are the major causes of air pollution in the State.  Since its formation, the  ARB has worked with the public, the business sector, and local governments to protect the public's health, the economy, and the state's ecological resources through the most cost-effective reduction of air pollution.  The California Air Resources Board (ARB) is uniquely qualified for this project  because the state of California is a leading state in  research into automobile emissions and because California exercises its authority as a 'grandfathered' pioneer in air quality management.  For example, some vehicles sold in California are specifically certified as producing fewer emissions  than the same model sold in other states.  California ARB is currently a leader in state investigations of the policy and technical options to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from mobile air conditioners that are the subject of this conference.  Additionally, California ARB has an established  and reputable base of contacts and experts that have agreed to participate and support the conference with technical presentations, vehicle demonstrations, and tours of engineering test facilities.   Most importantly, California has the same interest as EPA in attracting the best technical and  policy experts to present the latest information.  These unique qualifications are vital to the success of the conference. No other state or organization has the history, expertise, or industry connections available to ARB, which is why it would cost significantly more to procure these services  from a different source. Additional information about ARB's expertise and unique mobile source programs can be found at: http: //www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/msprog.htm. The point of contact for this announcement is Mark Mullen at mullen.mark@epa.gov  This will be a one-time purchase order.  THIS IS  NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. EPA, Mark Mullen (6202R), 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460; or to facsimile number (202) 565-2562, or by email at mullen.mark@epa.gov.  A determination not to compete the proposed  purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 513340   THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS  FOR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) RFQ-RT-05-00119.   EPA intends to award a sole source purchase order to F & J Specialty of Ocala, FL, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements. This procurement is to increase the capability of emergency response by adding a Global Positioning System (GPS) and Weather Station unit to each of the 40 stations of the Deployable National Radiological Monitoring Station (DNRMS) originally awarded under full and open competition  under contract 68D03051.    EPA is having 40 DNRMS manufactured to meet Homeland Security defense capability for radiological emergency response requirements.  This procurement adds the GPS unit for real-time location given in latitude, longitude, and elevation and the Weather Station unit provides  real-time weather conditions (i.e., wind speed, temperature conditions, etc.) for radiological data interpretation to add quality control and quality assurance requirements to the real-time data accessed through satellite up-link and other modes of data access.  Due to proprietary software in the  units manufactured by F&J Specialty, they are the only firm that can perform the integration of the GPS and Weather Station into the DNRMS to meet all the EPA requirements. Any responsible source that believes it is capable of meeting these requirements, may respond by submitting a written  narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attn: Terri Shook (D143-01), 4930 Old Page Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.  Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the  ability to meet the requirement.  Responses shall include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government,  an order will be placed with F & J Specialty.

<DESC>The contractor will provide the satellites and associated services described above in accordance with sections 3 and 4 of SS-SYS-600 Rev. C, dated 10 September 2004.  GPS is a navigational radio positioning, time transfer, and Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System.  The radio positioning and time transfer system provides a signal environment, which enables GPS users to precisely determine three-dimensional position, velocity, and system time.  The NUDET Detection System (NDS) provides the capability of near real time detection location, identification and characterization of worldwide nuclear events.  The GPS Space Segment consists of the GPS satellite constellation with its associated ground equipment, flight support equipment, computer programs, and SV to Launch Vehicle (LV) interface equipment.  The Space Segment provides the following capabilities in support of the GPS mission: L-Band Signal-In-Space (SIS) capability, a UHF signal for crosslink transmission, and a S-Band uplink/downlink interface to the control segment.  The operational constellation includes Blocks II, IIA, IIR, IIR-M and IIF satellite constellations.  The IIF Space Segment has responsibility for the space-based portions of the Navigation and NDS missions, for the crosslink operations, and for GPS IIF Autonav performance.  Individual satellites are equipped with government furnished payloads and associated downlinks to support the NDS mission.  The Block IIF System is interoperable with the NDS, existing Block IIA/IIR/IIR-M satellites, the Control Segment (CS) (including planned upgrades), and the user equipment segment.  GFE and facilities will be provided for the Control Segment.  The US Air Force intends to purchase non recurring engineering for production of satellites with options to purchase up to 15, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) Space Vehicles (SV) with identical capabilities of the IIF satellite, and associated services and Long Lead-time Items.  The Air Force will only procure enough additional IIF-like SVs to sustain the GPS constellation until the first GPS III SV with new capabilities can provide for constellation sustainment.  The anticipated first SV delivery is November 2010 to support a launch date of April 2011, with delivery of subsequent SVs nominally every four months thereafter.  The Government has been contracting with The Boeing Company, 5301 Bolsa Avenue, Huntington Beach, CA 92647 for the development and production of 12 GPS IIF SVs.  Any persons or companies interested in this notice are to respond to the requirements and submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) in writing to the Government that include the following information: 1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact and telephone numbers, 2) business size classification, Large, Small, or Other, 3) experience in GPS Satellites or similar technologies, 4) ability to satisfy the government's performance and schedule requirements described above, and 5) the facilities to work at the appropriate security level (SAP).  SOCs shall be submitted to SMC/GPK (ATTN: Donna Kimball), 2435 Vela Way, Suite 1866, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659. Oral communications are not acceptable.  SOCs shall be submitted by e-mail in MS Word 98 or higher format or PDF format.  Proprietary information must be expressly identified in the SOC.  SOCs are due 23 Feb 05. Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government to any particular acquisition approach.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information submitted by interested parties in response to this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>UPDATE, 8 FEB 05:  The effective date (Block 3 of SF30) should read "4 Feb 05" for Amendment 0002 posted 4 Feb 05. UPDATE, 4 FEB 05:  This update further elaborates on Question 23 and  our response in the “Industry Questions and Responses 26 Jan 05”  attachment: Q23.  Over and Above schedule for source selection evaluation purposes  is located in the Bidder+s Library.  Today the contractor cannot find  such information in the Bidder+s Library.  Recommend a) Populate the  Bidders Library with the required information or b) have the Offeror  assume 1 occurrence per year and insert a units/per occurrence price. A23.  This schedule is in the bidder+s library.  It is listed under  "PWS Referenced Documents/Aircraft Maintenance Manuals" - 1T-6A-6 insp  Req Bidders Copy.pdf. The schedule is in bidder’s library under Section III of 1T-6A-6.   However, upon further review, it appears bidders would have to make  several assumptions.  Therefore, bidders should bid the Over and Above  Fixed Price CLINs (X006) using a quantity of one with the unit price.   Bidders should also indicate if there will be any discount for quantity  breaks.  Bidders need to review the requirements in the 1T-6A-6 insp Req Bidders copy. Amendment 0002 to the Request for Proposal has been posted to the PIXS which incorporates the above changes in Section L of the RFP.  The amendment also makes corrections/clarifications in Sections B, I and K. The hour and date for receipt of proposals has not been extended.  UPDATE, 28 JAN 05:  Amendment 0001 to the Request for Proposal (RFP), released on 12 January 05, has been posted to the PIXS. An updated Acquisition Schedule is also posted.  The Government  must delay award of the COMBS Services contract until receipt of FY06 funding to ensure that obligation of the minimum purchase amount occurs at contract award.  Therefore, contract award has been changed from 1 September 2005 to 1 November 2005.  There are no other changes to the Acquisition Schedule.  The hour and date for receipt of offers has not been extended. UPDATE, 26 JAN 05:  In response to RFP Technical Clarifications  requests submitted by prospective offerors in accordance with RFP  Section L015, Government responses are hereby posted to the PIXS.   Some of these answers will result in administrative changes to the  RFP and will be posted via RFP Amendment 0001 within the next week.   Note:  No extension to the proposal submittal date will be authorized  in Amendment 0001.   UPDATE, 12 JAN 05:  The Bidders Library list has been posted.  If you need copies of files contained in the library, please contact Cheryle Lankford or Capt. Jason Ortiz.  A CD will be provided upon request. UPDATE, 12 JAN 05:  The final RFP is hereby released.  Also attached are the Acquisition Schedule and 2 PCO letters (Source Selection  Notification and Request for Proposal).  Please note Shannon Prince is no longer a POC for this effort.  The current POCs are:  Cheryle Lankford (937-904-4197), Capt. Jason Ortiz (937-904-4609) and Trini Rendon (937-904-4286). UPDATE, 3 JAN 05:  Regarding the Draft RFP posted 30 Dec 04, please be advised that the updated DRAFT RFP has a potential for up to a 10  year period of performance as opposed to the original 5 year period of performance.  All comments/questions to the current Draft RFP  should be received no later than 12:00 EST on 10 Jan 05.  The  Government may not respond with direct answers but may incorporate  comments into the Final RFP. UPDATE, 30 DEC 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) in response to the questions/comments to the DRFP posted 3 Nov 04.  Only documents with changes/updates are posted.  This includes the updated DRFP, Section L and Section M.  Blue change bars highlight changes made.  A document entitled "Industry Questions and Responses, 30 Dec 04" has also been posted.  Questions can be directed to Cheryle Lankford, 937-904-4197, or Capt. Jason Ortiz, 937-904-4609.  UPDATE, 24 NOV 04:  Our e-mail system went down November 12 and was out not fixed until sometime the following week.  As a result, some e-mail  was lost.  If you sent an e-mail responding to the draft RFP during that  time, it may not have been received.  If an e-mail was sent and you did not receive any response from our office advising receipt of the e-mail, please resubmit.  We apologize for any inconvenience. UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.

<DESC>This is modification 6 to the synopsis entitled Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA) Support Services Contract, Solicitation number NNJ-BJ4-JKC-5-001L which was posted on November 16, 2004.  This notice is issued by NASA/JSC to request information from interested parties regarding their preferred contracting approach. Information received as a result of this notice will be used for acquisition planning purposes only.  All responses must be received by February 25, 2005. The current Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance (SR&QA) Contract has the following features:  • Period of Performance: April 1, 1995 - March 31, 2005 (A 1-year extension to March 31, 2006 is currently being negotiated) • Contract Type: Cost Plus Award Fee, Level of Effort, 20% band from target hours without equitable adjustment  • Contract Value (Cost + Award Fee): Approximately $383 million • Average Budget: $35 million per year • Small Business Goals: 20% (20% to Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) with 8% going to Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs)) In an attempt to determine the contract approach for the new S&MA Support Services Contract, the Government is soliciting input from interested parties and asks that responses include, but are not limited to, the following:  &lt;B&gt;Please address what changes from the current SR&QA contracting approach, if any, you would suggest to the new S&MA contract and why? For example:&lt;/B&gt; • Contract Type:  NASA/JSC would be interested in your perspective on a Level-of-Effort Contract versus a Performance Based Contract.  If you have specific experience with Level-of-Effort and/or a Performance Based Contract in support of a Safety and Mission Assurance Contract, please provide pros and cons of each and your opinion of the type of work on the existing SR&QA contract that maybe better suited for one or the other or a combination thereof.   • Contract Period of Performance Duration: NASA/JSC would be interested in your perspective on how long the total contract period of performance should be and your views on option periods.  • Contract Content/Structure: Is there a need for special clauses or additional information in the contract that would clarify and improve understanding of the requirement?  • Performance Standards: In order to evaluate the successful offeror's performance, what factors should be taken into consideration by the Government? Please discuss your views regarding award fee and/or other appropriate incentives for contractor performance. • Small Business Goals: Based on your past experience with similar type work what do you think would be reasonable subcontracting goals for Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), Small Businesses (SBs), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones), Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs), Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), and Other Minority Educational Institutions (OMEIs)?  Please provide rationale for your suggestions.  Keep in mind that we are soliciting contract strategies that will promote competition by grouping and packaging logical functions in a way that promotes the synergism of work flow across contracts. &lt;B&gt;What additional documents would you want to see on the S&MA Procurement website (	     http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/sandma/		 ) and included in the Technical Library?&lt;/B&gt; Documents currently on the website include:  • Existing Statement of Work • Statement of Objectives  • Industry Day Information (slides, attendees) • Guidance on Discussions with Industry  • Venders Expressing Interest • Technical Library  • Procurement Development Team List Finally, we noted several items of interest during the industry day held last week.  We would appreciate your comments on NAIS code, Award Term and strategies for handling Conflict of Interest since those were all topics raised during the question and answer session.

SPiRiT is a modified version of the U.S. Green Building Council LEED Green Building Rating System. ** Cost estimates must be prepared using MCACES software(software provided by Government). All design files must be delivered in the (*.dgn) format.  All design files will be developed using the Tri Service AEC Standard as supplemented by the Savannah District instructions. The standards include naming convention, file and directory structure, line weights, levels, and color. ****** 3. SELECTION CRITERIA: Factors listed below will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: Significantly More Important - means that the fac tor is at least two times greater in value than another factor. More Important - means that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater. Equal - means that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another  factor.  For this solicitation, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, and Key Personnel are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Work Management, Past Performance, and Capacity, and significantly more important t han the other individual factors.  Work Management, Past Performance, and Capacity are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Small Business Participation and Volume of DoD Contract Awards. Small Business Participation and Vol ume of DoD Contract Awards are weighted equally and will only be used as *tie-breakers* among firms that are essentially technically equal.  Proposals will be evaluated on each of the criteria factors listed below.  Each factor will be assigned a rating fr om outstanding to unsatisfactory based on the risk to the government that the offeror will successfully perform the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus      rating will be given to each submission.  Award will be made to the firms determined to be most highly qualified.   Information on each factor should be submitted FOR THE OFFICE AND/OR EMPLOYEE PERFORMAING THE WORK IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  I t is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from more than one office.

<DESC>This is the first modification to Solicitation W914NS-05-Q-0021.  This modification is to provide answers to questions posed by industry. 


QUESTION: Does the PCO/FAA intend to allow contractor personnel to become position certified, facility rated and allow enough time in all ATC facilities to become professionally comfortable before OJT is performed?

ANSWER: Yes, The Government expects the contractor’s employees to gain familiarity with facility operations within the first 30-day period.  The operation at the BIAP airport is VFR/Special VFR with operations averaging 175 per 10-hour day (4 operations per 15-minute period). All contractor employees should be well versed in these operations and should have had experience at airports with a far higher operations count.

QUESTION:  Does the reference to NLT 30 Days in SOW Paragraph 4.1 apply to OJT as well?

ANSWER: OJT shall begin NLT 30 days after the contractor arrives for duty at the facility.

QUESTION:  If the 6 month period is to be waived in lieu of an assumed 30 day period above, does the PCO/FAA intend the contractor to operate and manage the BIAP and other ATCT facilities within 30 days after award? 

ANSWER: Management of the various facilities will remain under GECA control. The contractor is expected to primarily provide OJT to student controllers and to secondarily provide effective management techniques to the GECA supervisors and management staff. 

QUESTION:  If the PCO/FAA does not allow the contractor to become position certified and facility rated prior to performance of OJT does the PCO/FAA intend to waive any requirements for OJT certifications or will OJT also be performed by position certified/facility rated individuals outside the contract? (i.e. USAF controllers?)

ANSWER: The Government presumes that the contractor’s employees will be capable of acquiring a level of proficiency suitable to perform OJT NLT 30 days after the contractor arrives on duty at the facility. No other persons outside the contract are expected to provide OJT.

.

QUESTION:   Has the PCO/FAA or MOT/GECA established procedures for ICAO Class 3 medical and psychological evaluations? 

ANSWER: MOT/GECA has an established medical certification program but no MOT/GECA orders exist to verify that ICAO SARPs have been appropriately followed.

QUESTION:  Has the PCO/FAA or MOT/GECA implemented an evaluation screening program and what standards besides ICAO Annex 1 are being used? (Age limits etc.)

ANSWER: MOT/GECA relies on the screening practices of the past thirty years. This is one of the many management controls must be brought into compliance with ICAO SARPS.

QUESTION:   Has the PCO/FAA conducted a formal ATC training needs assessment and if so is the needs assessment available for review?

ANSWER: The FAA has been overseeing the BIAP tower operation since July 4, 2004, seven days per week/10 hours per day. No formal assessment has been done but primary training needs have been identified: technical air traffic control English language proficiency, VFR operations, and weather observations (LAWRS).

QUESTION:  If an ATC training needs assessment has not been performed, will the PCO allow the contractor to perform an ATC training needs assessment?

ANSWER: It is imperative that the contractor in concert with MOT/GECA perform an ATC training needs assessment. This assessment should identify the needs within the current control environment, and future needs when hostilities cease and standard international airport operations become possible.

QUESTION:  Will FAAO 3120.4 AT Technical Training be required as the basis for the development of the Iraqi ATC Controller Certification Program?

ANSWER: MOT/GECA is committed to adopt and adapt FAA orders to the extent possible to resurrect their management control procedures. Adaptation of FAAO 3120.4 should be accomplished in concert with the MOT/GECA ATS Director and should be an incremental process: minimum immediately required procedures, followed by a mid-term adaptation and assessment, and then leading to a final long-term document.

QUESTION:  What level of authority and responsibility will the contractor have regarding certifications?  

ANSWER: None.  The authority for all certifications rests with MOT/GECA. The contractor is responsible for providing controller assessments and certification recommendations to MOT/GECA. FAA oversight will continue throughout this and other phases of the execution of the contract.

QUESTION:  What level of authority and responsibility will the contractor possess during OJT instruction of Iraqi ATC Supervisors and Managers?

ANSWER: The contractor will provide advice and recommendations to ATC Supervisors throughout the course of each operational day. Management techniques should be discussed with the ATS Director as needed. The authority and responsibility of the tower operation rests with the MOT/GECA ATC Supervisors. 

QUESTION:  Who is presently responsible for daily operations and management oversight of BIAP ATCT?

ANSWER: MOT/GECA is responsible for daily operations and management oversight of the tower with assistance of an FAA ATC Advisor.

QUESTION:  What relationship if any will the current BIAP ATCT management have with the contractor?

ANSWER: The MOT/GECA ATS Director will receive direct benefit of the activities of the contractor. The FAA will continue in its ATC Advisory role.

QUESTION:  Does the PCO/FAA intend to transfer all or any responsibility or authority to the contractor for operating and managing BIAP ATCT? 

ANSWER: There is no such intent.

QUESTION:    Does the PCO/FAA intend to provide for a “Phase-In” period of contractor air traffic controllers to take operational control and management of BIAP?

ANSWER: The phase-in period in limited to the contractor’s need to gain familiarity sufficient to provide OJT and management advice and consultation. 

QUESTION:  Does the PCO/FAA intend to contract the operations and management of the BIAP and other ATCTs in Iraq?

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION:  If the contractor is to provide ATC services at any time during the contract what are the expected rolls of contractor personnel and who will the contractor’s personnel report to at the ATCT facilities?

ANSWER: The Contractor’s Project Leader.

QUESTION:  If contractor personnel are required to provide ATC duties does the PCO intend to dedicate contractor personnel for ATC services and then dedicate other contractor personnel for training? 

ANSWER: No.


QUESTION:  Can the contractor employ US FAA certified controllers to perform the training or do they need to be ICAO certified?

ANSWER: The contractor may employ any properly certified and experienced personnel (including Us FAA certified controllers) so long as they are able to apply ICAO procedures.

QUESTION:  What is the time requirement, if any, for employing these personnel with regards to currency or past experience? (ATC experience within the last 6 months? etc.)

ANSWER: Currency of experience and past experience are obvious requirements for the successful execution of any ATC contract. Considering the minimal density of air traffic operations at BIAP, Basrah and other facilities, the contractor should employ the best available employees possible without further guidance from GECA/PCO/FAA.


QUESTION:  Does the PCO/FAA intend to allow enough time for the contractor to train and certify contractor’s personnel for all ATCTs in order to operate and manage the facilities and then become OJT instructor certified?

ANSWER: The initial 30 days should be enough for this to be accomplished with the proper personnel.


QUESTION:  Will all facility memorandums, operation plans, Letter of Agreements, and other necessary publications be available for review prior to submission of quotes?

ANSWER:  No.


QUESTION: What minimum level of insurance will be required for the performance of this contract?

ANSWER:  Base Defense Act requirements.

QUESTION:  What level of actual ATC services performance by contractors is expected with the SOW as it is written?

ANSWER: OJT is the prime activity of this contract; actual ATC services beyond OJT will be rare.

QUESTION: Will the Government permit Contractor personnel to deploy to Iraq without a Secret Clearance?

ANSWER: The Government will allow Contractor personnel to begin the deployment process with a minimum of an interim Secret Clearance being granted.

QUESTION: What travel will be provided by the Government?

ANSWER: The Government will provide the initial transportation of a Contractor employee from CONUS to the area of operation (likely Kuwait City) and one return flight at the end of the contract or at the end of the employment of the employee.  The Government will provide transportation from Kuwait City to BIAP and between the several Iraqi airports.

QUESTION: What travel will be expensed by the winning Contractor?

ANSWER: The Contractor may seek reimbursement for employee travel between their home of record to the CONUS departure point at the beginning of their employment as well as travel from the CONUS arrival point at the end of their employment.

<DESC>There was a posting for a requirement for about 500 phones posted on January 10, 2005 regarding information for the feasiblity of combing celluar phone service on Lackland AFB.  I must correct that a new estimate should be between 225 phones and 300 phones for a combined acquisition.  I received a number of price quotations for 500 phones in which I must know if a price is submitted what is the min-max for the quotation.  This will still be a requirement for unlimited usage.  Please include ideas of how billing can be accomplished and billing issues can be solved.  Will it be necessary for each organization to have a clin or each phone to have its own separate clin. Will each organization have its own separate account?  As before this is not a request for proposal or request for quotation.  Currently we have separate delivery orders for different organizations and this is causing a number of billing issues. This is for the purpose of a market research report only and a conduction of a celluar phone exposition may occur at a later date.  Please submit information no later than 14 February 2005.

Network Centric Operations for aeronautical network is expected to begin within the next few years and evolve continuously as the technology and requirements evolve.    The Networking Research Group of NASA’s ACAST project has formulated a list of requirements to ensure global interoperability and deployment.	 The Network Research Group is seeking comments from various industries, academia and world government agencies regarding these salient requirements.  Comments are being sought from those directly involved in aeronautics, as well as telecommunication, communication, computer and information assurance providers as we believe those outside the traditional aeronautics community have expertise and insight that is directly applicable to network centric operations.  Application of commercial off the shelf technologies and techniques will, hopefully, enable network centric operation to be economically and technically realizable over the Global Airspace System. Submittal Instructions: 1.	Please send relevant literature and information to: E-mail address: wivancic@grc.nasa.gov NASA-Glenn Research Center Attn: William D. Ivancic M/S 54-4 21000 Brookpark Road Cleveland, OH 44135-3191 (216) 433-3494 2.   Such information shall include electronic file in either Microsoft Word, PDF or Postscript (PDF is preferred) with your comments to the System Requirements and Design Concepts.   As part of your information package, please include company Technical Point(s) of Contact including address, telephone number and e-mail address.  3.  The information received from this RFI is expected to be used by NASA, the DoD and the FAA to develop aeronautical network architectures and associated technologies.  Furthermore, we desire to make responses available to the global community via the World Wide Web.  Therefore, unless otherwise stated, all responses to this RFI shall be made publicly available.   Those wishing to keep their responses confidential should state so at the beginning of their response with such wording as “Confidential or Limited distribution.  Please do not disclose outside of the US Government.” 4.	At its discretion, NASA may request further discussions and/or clarification of the information submitted.  If agreeable to both parties, such discussions may take place via teleconferencing or on-site visit to NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio at the responder’s expense.  If they do occur, discussions will be constrained to a two hour time duration, and will consist of vendor presentations and subsequent discussions of the presented material only.  Representatives from the United States Government Agencies and its contractors may be present for such discussions. THIS RFI IS ISSUED SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION.  Contractors of NASA and the FAA that are assisting in the performance of the FAA/Eurocontrol Future Communications Study will have access to the information submitted for the purpose of conducting the technology pre-screening process.

<CONTACT>Teri Hudgins Contracting Officer 9076443306     teri_hudgins@nps.gov;
<DESC>To conduct surficial geologic mapping and prepare a surficial geologic map of the unmapped portions of the NOAT within the De Long Mountains, Noatak and Baird Mountains quadrangles, Alaska (scale: 1:250,000).  This mapping effort will use a combination of aerial photographic interpretation and field investigations.  This mapping effort will produce a surficial geologic map (1:250,000) of the unmapped portions of the De Long Mountains, Noatak and Baird Mountains quadrangles, unit descriptions, correlation tables, map symbols and an appropriate text description to accompany the map. To resolve any surficial geologic mapping inconsistencies between previously published USGS surficial mapping projects including the Misheguk Mountain and Baird Mountains (USGS Open-File Report 03-367, 2003), Ambler River (MF-1677), Howard Pass (MF-1678), Killik River (MF-1234) and Survey Pass (MF-1320) quadrangles.  This effort will facilitate the publication of a USGS surficial geologic map  (1:250,000) of the NOAT. To prepare a report detailing 100+ bluff exposures of the Noatak basin.  The report will consist of scale drawings and written descriptions of 100 measured bluff exposures together with 80 radiocarbon age determinations on organic samples and other analytic data where available.  Accompanying text will discuss the geologic significance of the bluff exposures and their relevance to overall basin history.  Maps showing bluff locations and their relation to surficial geologic features will be prepared.  A glossary of technical terms used will complete the report.  Methods The primary tools in mapping the surficial geology will be aerial photography and on-site field ground truthing.   Data collected during the field mapping effort (summer 2005) will be incorporated into the map product and the bluff report.  The Contractor will:  1.	Map the surficial geology of the unmapped portions of the Noatak National Preserve within the DeLong Mountains, Noatak, and Baird Mountains quadrangles at a scale of 1:250,000 using aerial photography supplemented by ground truthing during the 2005 field season.  This surficial geology mapping effort will: a.	Continue the high quality and detail of surficial geologic mapping represented in USGS Open File Report 03-367, both in regards to mapping accuracy of unit boundaries and unit descriptions. b.	Assure mapping consistency (in terms of geologic units and geologic descriptions) between new mapping areas in the De Long Mountain and Noatak quadrangles and USGS OFR 03-367. c.	Compile surficial geologic map data on a stable base for those portions of the NOAT within the De Long Mountains, Noatak and Baird Mountains quadrangles, Alaska at a scale of 1:250,000.  d.	Prepare map unit descriptions that will include, at a minimum:  glacial deposits, alluvial deposits, fan, colluvial deposits and a generic bedrock category. Other units that should be mapped if present are: lacustrian deposits, deltaic deposits, terrace deposits, beach deposits and aeolian deposits.  2.	Resolve all surficial geologic mapping inconsistencies between previously published USGS maps (Misheguk Mountain and Baird Mountains quadrangles (USGS Open-File Report 03-367, 2003), Ambler River (MF-1677), Howard Pass (MF-1678), Killik River (MF-1234), and Survey Pass (MF-1320) quadrangles). This will ensure that geologic units correlate well across all the quadrangle boundaries of the Noatak National Preserve and that unit description and unit correlation tables are consistent.   3.	Prepare a unit correlation table that incorporates all the surficial geologic units identified within the Noatak National Preserve.  This will include the surficial geologic units mapped in the Delong Mountains and Noatak quadrangles, OFR 03-367, Ambler River (MF-1677), Howard Pass (MF-1678), Killik River (MF-1234) and Survey Pass (MF-1320) quadrangles. 4.	Prepare a section describing the  "Map Symbols" use for the Surficial Geologic Map of the Noatak National Preserve. 5.	Prepare an appropriate text explanation to accompany the surficial geologic map of NOAT. 6.	Prepare a detailed report on the bluff exposures within the Noatak basin.  This report will include discussions of 100 bluff exposures in the Noatak River system downstream from its headwaters.  Bluff stratigraphy will be described and illustrated successively for the upper Noatak River and for five or more other sectors farther downstream.  These sections are to be integrated with regional geology to provide a basin-wide record of middle and late Pleistocene glacier fluctuations and lake response, and of intervening fluvial episodes.  This report will include: a.	Text (bluff exposure descriptions, discussion of geologic significance, Pleistocene history of the Noatak Basin) b.	Scale drawings of measured bluff sections c.	Radiocarbon age data d.	Other analytical data where available, e.	Glossary of technical terms used.  f.	Location maps 7.	Provide for commercial air travel from Anchorage to Kotzebue and return in support of 2005 field investigations.  Provide for per diem for staff while in Kotzebue.  Provide for per diem for staff while in NOAT conducting field investigations.  Work to begin in May 2005 and completed by October 1, 2006. Qualifications:  Knowledge of Noatak River Valley and associated mountain ranges, at least 10 years.  Qualiftied to generate these required maps according to USGS standards and methodologies listed above--must provide USGS contact name and phone number associated with an actual job of this nature performed, to demonstrate this requirement. WE are aware of one known source, Dr. Thomas Hamilton and he is interested in completing this work.  He also was responsible for the initial USGS maps generated for the area described in the statement of work above.

<SUBJECT>67--Near-Infrared Digital Camera
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Spiricon Inc, Logan, UT.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center, Developmental Test Command, US Army Test and Evaluation Command.  The Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC) has a need to procure a Near-Infrared Digital Camera System and associated parts.  This Near-Infrared (NIR) camera system will be integrated into the RTTC's Automated Laser Instrumentation Measurement System (ALIMS) Laboratory.  The ALIMS laboratory is used to test U.S. Army Laser Designator Systems.  This laboratory has been operational for over 10 years and is being upgraded to support continued use.  The NIR camera system being procured is a direct descendent of the current system already used in the ALIMS laboratory.  Use of other NIR camera systems would require extensive integration and redesign efforts that will not be necessary if these compatible systems are procured.  Spiricon Inc is the only company that can build the camera that matches the design, both technically and physically; and only direct sales from the company are available.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to convert to another vendor's system to include software and hardware engineering efforts to integrate with other test equipment, documentation, material handling costs and material costs to support spare parts and additional man-hours to develop the capability to maintain another vendor's systems.  Through the use of market research including literature review, internal searches, and expert knowledge from Richard Brown,  Chief, Subsystem Test & Analysis Branch, RTTC, it has been determined that the equipment required by RTTC is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. Other manufacturers have been considered, but do not meet compatibility requirements. The use of alternate sources would result in a duplication of effort and cost that would not be recovered through competition.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST February 22, 2005 will be considered by the Government.  POC:  Susan Lawson, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be e-mailed  to Susan Lawson at Susan.Lawson@mms.gov.

<SUBJECT>47 -- Pneumatic Tube System for CRC
<DESC>The National Institutes intends to award a sole source purchase order to Swisslog Translogic on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)-Only 1 responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for the furnishing and installation of 3 six(6) inch pneumatic tube stations in the Clinical Research Center, located in Bethesda, Maryland.  The contractor shall furnish and install three pneumatic stations (six inch carriers) in the CRC.  The stations will be located in the Pediatric Clinic, Alcohol Clinic and the 5NE patient care unit. INSTALLATION OF THIS EQUIPMENT SHALL NOT ADVERSELY EFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM NOR EFFECT THE WARRANTY PROVISIONS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM.

The new stations must be seamlessly compatible with the existing Swisslog, Six-Inch, Recessed Pneumatic Tube System presently installed throughout the Clinical Center Complex.  The features and system specifications of the existing Swisslog system include:

•Recessed Stations for optimal receiving and dispatching of carriers.  Receiving bin accommodates several carriers at one time with the ability to queue a carrier for dispatch.  The recessed station provides a clean installation.  Stations can be added with minimal disruption to the work area either during the construction phase of the project or within existing finished areas of the hospital as in this case.
•I.Q. Control Panel on each new system which incorporates user-friendly features to make it easy to send carriers, access system information and diagnose station problems.  Features to include:  backlit LCD panel (240 horizontal by 64 vertical pixel display), numeric keypad, direct access keypad (send/enter, cancel/clear, menu, directory, empty, send), Twelve button Quick Key Panel with LED Indicators (configurable as speed dial buttons, personal indicators with discrete addresses, and as a returned carrier indicator).  Panel Options to include:  Audible Full Station, Audible Carrier Arrival, Audible Surplus Indicator, Contrast Adjustment, Audio Level, Set Time & Date.  Transaction Options to include:  Carrier Tracking, Carrier Forwarding, STAT Transaction, Secure Transaction, View Last 30 Transactions, Station Directory.
•TL 2005 Software offering maximum flexibility, performance and convenience in the management and maintenance of the pneumatic tube system.

The new control panels must offer exactly the same features and mode of operation as existing control panels so that staff are not required to learn different hardware, software and operational processes.  Standardization of the pneumatic tube system reduces user error and maintenance/repair costs.

The work to be performed shall include all modifications needed for the installation of the additional tube stations.  Modifications may include but are not limited to:

•Installing, terminating and labeling communication cable
•Cutting holes in walls for installation
•Removal and repair of existing walls, wall coverings, ceilings, floor coverings, etc
•Patching and fireproofing wall penetrations
•Removal and repair of ceiling tiles
•Providing dust partitions, as required
•Supply and installation of access panels
•Furring-in stations (stud, drywall and finish)
•Clean up and disposal of debris

The contractor shall furnish 12 Swisslog Duraband 6 inch carriers with thick and thin foam inserts (4ea/carrier).  Vendor shall include a two year, full service, warranty on parts, installation, equipment and software for the new stations.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is ??????????. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 334112 and the corresponding size standard is 1,000 employees. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 2001-27.   The Polar Ecosystems Program of the National Marine Mammal Laboratory requires Satellite-Linked Data Recording tags (SDRs) to study the movements, haul-out behavior, and diving behavior of seals.  These instruments will be used to record individual seals’ behavior and transmit the data through the Argos satellite system (www.argosinc.com).  The data consist of movements, calculated by Argos as latitude and longitude positions, and behavior, recorded as the status of a wet/dry sensor (i.e., sea water versus air) or as differences in water pressure at depth.  These units must be small (so that when attached to an animal they don’t affect its behavior), durable, and efficient, to maximize battery life. Two types of SDRs are required:  SDR type #1 (Quantity 20 required, delivery by 5 April 2005) - This tag must be very small (maximum mass of 60 g in air, 80mm [L] x 19.5mm [W] x 10.5mm [H], antenna length 20 cm), and permanently affixed to a Temple Original animal tag (www.templetag.com), which is the means for attaching the SDR to a seal’s hind flipper.  The SDR must be affixed to the Temple tag with the long axis of both units aligned, the SDR centered over the length and width of the Temple tag, and with the opening end of the Temple tag oriented with the antenna end of the SDR.  The SDR must have sufficient battery capacity for 10,000 Argos transmissions at 0.5W radiated power. To extend and control deployment length, the SDR must: (1) Include a wet/dry sensor that limits transmissions to when the tag is clear of the water; (2) Allow user programmable duty-cycling by day or month; (3) Allow user programmable limit of the total number of transmissions per day; (4) Allow user programmable limit of transmissions to hours when a satellite is likely to be in view.
The SDR must record, calculate, and transmit daily “percentage haul-out timelines” indicating the percent of time during each hour that the SDR’s wet/dry sensor is out of the water.  Each timeline must be stored and transmitted for at least 4 days to ensure complete records are received through the Argos system. The SDR must be potted in resin (preferably clear) to withstand pressure at depths up to 500 m of water. All user programming and control of the SDR must be provided through included software that runs under the Microsoft Windows XP operating system.  At least one set of cables and other hardware required for programming/controlling the SDRs must be provided.  Windows-based software must be provided for user decoding of the Argos data into an easy-to-read format.
Tag type #2 (quantity 80 required, delivery by 1 August 2005) - This tag must be small (i.e., maximum mass in air of 250 g, 165mm [L] x 39.5mm [W] x 34mm [H]), but it must have sufficient battery life to provide 150,000 Argos transmissions at 0.5W radiated power.  To extend and control deployment length, the SDR must: (1) Include a wet/dry sensor that limits transmissions to when the tag is clear of the water; (2) Allow user programmable duty-cycling by day or month; (3) Allow user programmable limit of the total number of transmissions per day; (4) Allow user programmable limit of transmissions to hours when the satellite is likely to be in view; (5) Recognize whether the animal is at-sea or hauled-out, and transmit at the appropriate rates. Argos permits a maximum of one transmission every 45 seconds when the animal is at-sea, and one transmission every 90 seconds when the animal is hauled out; (6) Allow suspension of transmissions after the animal has hauled out for a user-defined number of hours.  The SDR must collect data on depth (1 m resolution), temperature, light levels, and wet/dry periods, and summarize them into compressed histograms for transmission through the Argos system.  The numbers of bins (up to 14 per histogram), the bin cut-points, the period of coverage (1-24 hours), and the starting time of each histogram must be user programmable.  The SDR must provide, at a minimum, the following types of data messages, selectable by the user: (1) Dive duration histograms: Number of dives within the specified dive duration ranges; (2) Maximum dive depth histograms: Number of dives whose maximum depth is within the specified depth ranges; (3) Time-at-depth histograms: Time spent within the specified depth ranges; (4) Time-at-temperature histograms: Time spent within the specified temperature range; (5) Percentage timelines: What percentage of the hour the tag was above a user-specified threshold depth, or dry; (6) 20-minute timelines: Each 24 hour period is divided into 20-minute increments. Each increment is marked with whether it was generally deeper than a configurable depth, or was dry. This is required for compatibility with data collected from older SDRs used by the Polar Ecosystems Program; (7) Each timeline must be stored and transmitted for at least 4 days to ensure complete records are received through the Argos system. Because the behavior of diving animals limits access to the Argos satellite system, the SDR must provide the option of condensing multiple data messages into a single transmission to increase data throughput. Transmissions must include status messages at user-programmable intervals for battery voltage, the number of transmissions sent, the current zero-pressure offset value, the current time according to the internal clock, and seawater conductivity.  The SDR must be potted in resin (preferably clear) to withstand pressure at depths up to 1000 m of water.  The potting must be cast in as hydrodynamic a form as possible, given the limitations imposed by the internal components, and be abraded on the bottom surface for adhesion to quick-setting epoxy, used to attach the SDR to a seal’s pelage. All user programming and control of the SDR must be provided through included software that runs under the Microsoft Windows XP operating system.  At least one set of cables and other hardware required for programming/controlling the SDRs must be provided.  Windows-based software must be provided for user decoding of the Argos data into an easy-to-read format. All SDR’s are to be delivered to National Marine Mammal Laboratory, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 by the required delivery date.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
1.0 BACKGROUND
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates nine HU25C and six HU25D model aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel. The HU25C & D uses the Wescam FLIR system. These aircraft are used in surveillance missions that are performed mainly over water with aircraft and system components being exposed to salt-laden environments. Line Replaceable Units (LRU’S) contained within each system are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). This tracking provides, but is not limited to: an individual LRU historical record of repair and/or overhaul; tracking of component time (TSN/TIS, TSO, and MTBF); component status; and physical location.
2.0  OBJECTIVE
The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of the OEM to effectively repair/overhaul and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 LRU’s. "Repaired/overhauled LRU's must meet the OEM current specifications and must perform at the system level". Each LRU when installed shall be required to operate/interact with the other LRU’s within the radar and OASIS system without need of adjustment or degradation of system operation. The system is also comprised of many subcomponents that provide video and power distribution to operate these LRU's.
The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to: Trained personnel; Required Tooling; Calibrated Test Equipment; FAA and/or OEM approved replacement parts; publications and documents pertaining to the LRU; preservation and shipping.
The offeror’s responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work.
Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center’s (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  
B. To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives, the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria:

b. Provide a written Performance Metrics plan.
c. Provide evidence of an ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.
d. Possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, and fixtures to meet the OEM current specifications.

f. Provide repercussions for failure to meet Turn-Around-Time (TAT).
2. Past Performance
a. Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items.
b. Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years to include: references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.
3. Pricing

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>THIS IS THE CONTINUED PORTION OF HSCG38-05-Q-101001
Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.
NOTICE OF FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair nd timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

C.3.7   For import shipments the contractor will make the necessary arrangements for clearing the freight through U.S. Customs and shipping the freight to a supplier as designated by NAS Bogota.  

C.3.8	The contractor will provide input and participate in on going process improvement initiatives on-site, as required.  Within 30 days of contract award, the contractor will provide a copy of local procedures, a process map, and, based on past experience with this and similar programs, a list of common problems encountered that may cause rework or hold ups in the freight forwarding process and recommended solutions for improvement.
