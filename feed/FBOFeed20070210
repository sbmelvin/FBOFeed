<DESC>Attachment 2 - PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY 
Performance Based Deduction Formula
Performance Objective	PWS Para.	Weight	Maximum Allowable Defect Rate	Surveillance Method
Collect refuse in a timely manner	C.3.2	70%	1 Defect per month	
Dispose of refuse and in a timely manner	C.3.5	5%	1 Defect per month	COTR inspection and verified customer complaint
Sanitize containers	C.3.3.1	5%	1 Defect per month	COTR inspection and verified customer complaint
Maintain and replace contractor furnished containers as necessary	C.3.3.2	5%	1 Defect per month	COTR inspection and verified customer complaint
Deduction Threshold. If the number of defects, or instances of unacceptable performance, observed during a month-long period is equal to or less than the maximum allowable defect rate (MADR), then there will be no deduction in payments to the Contractor for that task. However, if the number of defects observed during a month-long period is greater than the MADR, then there will be a deduction in payments to the Contractor for that task.

Example of Deduction Amount to Contractor Payments.

(a) The MADR for refuse collection and recycling is 1 defect per month based on the performance objective. A verified customer complaint regarding any maintenance work that falls below the standards set forth in the PWS will be considered a defect as will any inspected work that falls below the same standards. If one or more complaint is received regarding the same item this will only be considered one complaint. Upon notice of the defect(s) the contractor will be given 24 hours to correct prior to the taking of a deduction;
Page 1 of 2 
(b) Assume that there is one verified customer complaint regarding untimely refuse collection during the month;
(c) One defect exceeds the MADR of zero, therefore, there will be a deduction in
the payment to the Contractor for this month;
(d) The deduction amount will be as follows:
(i)	Assume the maximum possible contract payment for items C.3.2. 1, C.3.5, C.3.3.1 and C.3.3.2 is $15,000 per month.
(ii)	Timely refuse collection is weighted at 85% of the monthly total payment, which equals $12,750.
(iii)	A deduction of 1 / 30 of $12,750 will be taken for every day the defect remains uncorrected, starting from the date the defect was first reported to the contractor.
(iv)	Therefore if the defect was reported to the contractor on July 1 and it was not corrected until July 6 this would equal five defective days. Thus the deduction would be 5 X 1/30 X $12,750 = $2,125
(v)	The Contractor will receive a monthly payment of $12,875 which is the maximum possible monthly payment of $15,000 minus the deduction amount of $2,125.
Surveillance Guide and Evaluation Procedure. The COTR will use an inspection checklist to evaluate Contractor performance. At the
end of each month, the COTR will summarize his or her findings, calculate the recommended deduction amount, if any, and forward
this recommendation to the Contracting Officer

Attachment 3 
QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
FOR
REFUSE COLLECTION, DISPOSAL AND RECYCLING AT
U.S. COAST GUARD NOVATO FAMILY HOUSING AND
PACIFIC STRIKE TEAM, HAMILTON FIELD
NOVATO, CALIFORNIA
1. Purpose: This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) describes methods that the Government will use to monitor whether the Contractor's performance of the above contract is acceptable. The QASP is the Government's written plan for administering the Contract and monitoring major aspects of the Contractor's performance. The QASP is not part of the Contract. It is provided to the Contractor solely for informational purposes and is subject to change by the Government at any time during the contract performance period. Therefore, the Government reserves the right to perform more or less surveillance than is provided in this QASP.

2. Introduction: The QASP establishes a method to evaluate the services the Contractor is required to furnish. It is designed to provide an effective method of monitoring Contractor performance for each listed objective on the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) in the contract. The Government is concerned with the quality of the services provided, and not with the method that the Contractor uses to provide these services. If performance of any required service is unsatisfactory as a result of the Contractor's actions or omissions, then the Government may reduce the contract payments to reflect the decreased value of the services received in accordance with the PRS and/or applicable FAR clauses.

3. Responsibility for Quality Control: The Contractor, not the Government, is responsible for quality control and management actions to meet the terms of the Contract. The Government performs quality assurance to monitor whether Contract standards are achieved.

4. Surveillance Methods- The Government will evaluate the Contractor's performance under this contract. Government surveillance may include, but is not limited to, the following methods:
a. Periodic Inspections by the COTR or designated Government Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE).
b. Validated Customer Complaints. (See Encl 1)

PERIODIC INSPECTIONS: This method is sometimes called "planned sampling." It consists of the evaluation of tasks selected on other than a 100 percent or random basis. This method will be used on those items identified as such in the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS).
Quarterly MADRs: The COTR or QAE will perform regular inspections on Vehicles in use on Government property in conjunction with normal pickup days, but the inspections will not interfere with normal collection operations. The COTR or QAE will conduct an inspection of at least one (1) trip per Quarter. The COTR or QAE will draw a number from 1 to 12 at the beginning of each Quarter to determine which weekly trip will be inspected under this method of sampling. Monthly MADRs: The COTR or QAE will conduct monthly inspections of at least (1) one performance objective per month. The COTR or QAE will draw a number from I to 4 at the beginning of each month to determine which week the inspections will take place.
 


ATTACHMENT 3 

VALIDATED CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS: Any base employee that observes unacceptable services, whether incomplete or not performed, for any performance objectives should immediately contact the COTR. The COTR will record the complaint including date and time, customer name, phone number and the nature of the complaint. The COTR will respond as soon as possible after receipt of a complaint to conduct a site visit to personally observe the reported defect. If the COTR determines the complaint is valid, the COTR will complete appropriate documentation to record the complaint and notify the Contractor of the defect. The COTR should inform the customer of the approximate time the unacceptable performance will be corrected and advise the customer to contact the COTR if not corrected. For purposes of calculating deductions, a validated customer complaint will be treated as if it had been identified as part of periodic inspections.

5. Deduction Methods: The Government will record all instances of substandard performance, whether through inspections, direct observation, customer complaint, or any other mechanism. The Government's preferred course of action will be discussions with the Contractor to make the Contractor aware of the problem, and to effectively prevent any recurrence of substandard performance. However, the Government may also take the following actions in addition to, or instead of, discussions with the Contractor: a. Presentation of a Contract Discrepancy Report requiring a written explanation for substandard performance;
b. Payment deductions in accordance with the PRS; and/or
c. Payment deductions in accordance with the applicable FAR clause(s).

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
