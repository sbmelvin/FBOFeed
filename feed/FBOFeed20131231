<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Software and Engineering Services II (SES II). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for Software and Engineering Services (SES II)and is hereby soliciting information about potential sources and is seeking capability statements from all interested parties including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the SES II Procurement. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. The current SES contract supports the Software Engineering Division (SED). SED provides quality software products, services, and expertise to ensure the success of NASA missions and stakeholders. Products, services and expertise include: flight, ground and science data systems and technologies; mission management, mission operations and mission validation capabilities (see SED's website for complete organization details at http://aetd.gsfc.nasa.gov/code580/ ). SED is responsible for the engineering of software and information systems throughout all phases (formulation through on-orbit operations) of NASA programs and projects. These systems include: flight, ground, and science data software for spacecraft monitoring, control, on-orbit performance management and operations; spacecraft data processing and analysis; information management; and science data analysis and management. The SED focuses on the development of reusable flight and ground architectures and frameworks to reduce mission cost, decrease development time, minimize customer risk, and increase the scientific value of information products. The SED provides expertise in software systems engineering, secure environments, and the software product development lifecycle to ensure the delivery of reliable software and information systems solutions. To improve the quality of the software engineering processes and hence the products produced by them, NASA Headquarters Office of the Chief Engineer (OCE) has mandated significant requirements that effect this contract. Any organization developing, maintaining, or acquiring software for NASA must adhere to NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 7150.2 and the Goddard companion Goddard Procedural Requirements (GPR) 7150.x, as applicable for mission success. These NPR and GPRs are directly tied to the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) for Development from the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon or equivalent. These requirements are directly applicable to SED for the in-house products we provide to GSFC flight missions as well as the programmatic oversight for out-of-house missions managed by GSFC. It is anticipated that SES II will be a single award competitively solicited Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) cost plus fixed-fee contract. Responses to this Sources Sought will be used to determine if the anticipated solicitation will be an 8(a) or a small business set-aside. NASA is seeking capabilities from all categories of Small Businesses for the purpose of determining the appropriate level of competition and /or Small Business Subcontracting goals as a requirement. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences and the size standard is 1,000 employees. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications, in writing, no later than January 21, 2014. Qualified organizations must demonstrate experience and capability in performing the engineering functions described in the SES II Statement of Work. The statement of capability shall include: a) Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives. b) Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses. c) If qualified as an 8 (a) firm, the company must be certified by SBA, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages. d) DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.).

Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from industries responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and a future RFP (if applicable). The company's standard format is acceptable; however, the limit for all responses is not to exceed ten (10) single-sided pages. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. Information may be submitted via email or mail to: NASA/GSFC, ATTN: Lisa A. Mullen, Mail Code 210.3, Building 11, Room S215F, 8800 Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, MD 20771;or via electronic transmission to Lisa.A.Mullen@nasa.gov. When responding, reference Sources Sought NNG14498942R-2. THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION FOR BID.

<p>Scope: Demolish from 2 to 8 Army Family Housing buildings, including foundations and all associated site work, at Fort Greely, Alaska. Fort Greely is located along the Richardson Highway, approximately 100 miles south of Fairbanks Alaska. Fort Greely is near Delta Junction, Alaska which as limited housing and support facilities. The eight buildings are all located in the same general area along Third Street in the Cantonment area of Fort Greely. Each building is a townhouse style eight-plex with approximate 15,000 square footage per building. The buildings were constructed in the 1960s and are spread footing, concrete foundations with wood framing. Six of the buildings have attached garage additions that will also be removed. Hazardous surveys have been conducted, and all the buildings have extensive asbestos, which must be removed before final demolition. Various site work around the buildings will be removed including parking lots, Headbolt outlets, stoops, electrical, utilidors, and sidewalks. The utilidors will be demolished back to the mainlines and are assumed to contain asbestos covered piping. The foundation holes will be filled with classified fill and the area will be graded, receive topsoil and seeded. There will be a 58% diversion goal from landfills for all non-hazardous construction debris. The base landfill will be available for disposal of asbestos material and other Construction waste. The area is next to existing occupied housing areas, so noise, safety, dust, etc. are important to manage on this project.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs intends to solicit for Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) for providing Primary Care and Mental Health Services in a private hospital, office or clinic environment to veterans primarily residing in Sanilac County; Macomb County; and St. Clair County, Michigan.  The result of this solicitation will be a Firm Fixed Priced capitated rate contract from the date of contract award to September 30 with 4 option years.   This acquisition will use the streamlined acquisition process as provided by FAR Part 15, Contract by Negotiation.  This procurement is anticipated to provide a single award to the quote providing the best value to the Veteran Affairs (VA).

The Contractor shall be responsible for protecting all Contractor personnel furnishing services.  To carry out this responsibility, The Contractor shall provide or certify that the following is provided for all contract staff providing services under the resultant contract:

-	Workers' compensation
-	Professional liability insurance
-	Health examinations
-	Income tax withholding, and
-	Social security payments

Major duties to perform:


Contractor performing Primary Care and Mental Health services shall provide a continuum of care from prevention to diagnosis and treatment, to appropriate referral and follow-up.  The Contractor shall provide CBOC services solely dedicated to veterans regardless of gender or age.  Those patients needing specialty or follow-up care shall be referred to VA.   Contractor's CBOC must have the necessary professional medical staff, diagnostic testing and treatment capability, and referral arrangements needed to ensure continuity of health care.  The Contractor shall be responsible for meeting or exceeding VA and TJC (or equivalent) standards.  The hours of operation for services rendered will be Monday - Friday from 8:00 am to 4:30pm, with one weekday clinic extending to 6:00pm as well as a one Saturday clinic per month.  The extended weekday clinic and monthly Saturday clinic will be determined by JDDVAMC.

The care will be provided by primary care providers who may be general practitioners or general internists or their authorized designees.  The proposed CBOC, at a minimum, shall provide one standard of care that must be consistent, safe and of high quality.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-APG, Natick Contracting Division, in support of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center, is conducting a market survey to identify companies for potential thread manufacturers to conduct Research and Development to provide full scale Berry Amendment compliant production for a new low-cost Fire Resistant/Heat Resistant (FR/HR) sewing thread.  The Government requires state-of-the-art fiber technology and fabrication processing for sewing threads to be used as an alternate for current Meta-Aramid (Nomex ) and/or Para-Aramid (Kevlar ) sewing threads being used for combat clothing, combat gloves, flight/combat vehicle crewman uniforms and a variety of other end-items used in potentially high heat environments for all services and other Government Agencies. Currently there are four Government FR/HR type thread specifications consisting of either Nomex  or Kevlar  fibers which respectively decompose at 700 F and 850 F.  US Army Specifications include: A-A-50195  quote mark Thread, Aramid quote mark , A-A-55195  quote mark Thread Para-Aramid, Spun quote mark , A-A-55217  quote mark Thread, Aramid, Spun Staple quote mark , and A-A-55220 Thread, Para-Aramid Intermediate Modulus quote mark .  All of these are used in the fabrication of Military items.  These thread fibers are derived from a sole-sourced fiber supplier.  Additionally, color matching is difficult and expensive. The sole source provider no longer offers Solution Dyed shades and as a result, thread cost has increased considerably.  Field experience has proven that these threads offer limited stretch and UV resistant (color fading and strength reduction) characteristics.  Also these threads tend to slice through sewn stitch lines and base outer shell material to create open seams.  A recent evaluation of USMC Combat Gloves showed a high incidence of open seams on palms and finger tips due to Kevlar  actually slicing through the Lockstitch 301 at the interlock points of the stitch lines.  This is due to the low stretch and extreme toughness of fibers.  Creating a domestic supply chain for FR based sewing threads would offer lower cost FR garments, lessen the current long lead times for FR thread production and assure faster delivery times.  The goal of this survey is to determine if a domestic capability and/or technology exists to reduce base fiber costs in combination with enhanced thread manufacturing processes working toward modernized high speed thread production vs. current Nomex  and Kevlar  type threads.  Threads shall be compliant with Berry Amendment, 10 USC 2241, and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Clause 252.225-7012 Preference for Certain domestic Commodities. meet FR requirements with minimum burning, no melt drip, in combination with sufficient strength and elongation to sew uniforms and gloves and offer minimum of 500 F heat resistance in order that a typical combat uniform fabricated with such thread(s) survives ASTM-F-1930, 4 sec manikin heat test with no significant loss in Seam Efficiency.  Other factors include capability to dye typical military shades, offer colorfastness properties, Ultra-Violet resistance, withstand 50 home launderings, minimum shrinkage, resistance to discoloration, be capable of high speed sewing to withstand intense needle heat and be available in multiple Tex sizes.  All interested firms and manufacturers are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  All submissions should include available technologies new to FR/HR fibers, polymers, finishes, thread manufacturing capabilities such as wrapped core technologies, spun and filament concepts, discussion of physical properties, product literature, illustrations, drawings and relevant background/experience.  Information submissions must be received no later than 30 January 2014.  All information supplied shall be considered confidential unless otherwise specified by the firm or is available from other sources.  This Market Survey is for planning and information purposes only.  This is not an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal and not to be taken as a commitment by the Government.   Information relating to this Request for Information should be submitted via email to Michelle Miller, Contract Specialist, at michelle.m.miller22.civ@mail.mil, no later 30 January 2014.

<p>Issued By:<br />National Cancer Institute (NCI), <br />Office of Acquisitions (OA) <br />http://www.nci.nih.gov  or http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/</p>
<p>Key Dates:<br />Capability Statement Due Date:  January 15, 2014 by 4:00 PM EST</p>
<p>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).<br />The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990 with a size standard of $14 million is being considered</p>
<p>As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) through FedBizOpps. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>Breast cancer mortality rates have declined over the past 20 years and although much of the improvements in mortality have been attributed to early diagnosis and adjuvant treatment of early stage breast cancer, these treatment regimens are associated with substantial short-term toxicity and risk of long-term adverse effects, such as secondary malignancies, neuropathy, cognitive impairment, and cardiotoxicity.  Until recently, women with breast cancer have received adjuvant chemotherapy based on clinical recurrence risk classification using qualitative tumor characteristics, such as size, type and grade, receptor status, and histology, although increasingly gene expression profiling is being used to direct adjuvant therapy choices. Nevertheless, many women will still receive adjuvant chemotherapy that will have only a modest effect on disease-free and overall survival.  These patients may receive limited benefit from chemotherapy and an improved understanding of these long-term adverse risks of treatment could help to inform clinical decision-making about adjuvant chemotherapy (i.e., women with low risk of recurrence could avoid potential toxicity and morbidity of adjuvant chemotherapy).  Even when use of chemotherapy is indicated, patients are seldom informed about the specific risks for long-term and late effects, which could potentially inform treatment decision-making.  Yet, no systematic reviews or risk appraisal have addressed this question.</p>
<p>Long-term and late adverse effects (e.g., leukemia, congestive heart failure, neuropathy, cognitive dysfunction, infertility) of chemotherapy are widely acknowledged, but their risks are not explicitly considered in currently available risk prediction models.  This limits the ability of clinicians and patients to weigh the potential harms versus benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in treatment decision making.  Randomized trials of adjuvant chemotherapy have predominantly focused on evaluating the reduction in cancer recurrence and on treatment-associated short-term adverse effects.  Less attention has been given to long-term adverse effects of these cytotoxic drugs, which may have significant negative impacts on health and QOL for breast cancer survivors long after their treatment ends.</p>
<p>The aim of this requirement is to estimate the rates of long-term adverse effects of commonly used adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer by conducting a systematic review of the literature and by analyzing data collected from a clinical trial of over 5,000 patients with node-positive breast cancer.  This project is critical not only to define what the NCI currently knows about treatment harms, but perhaps more importantly, to identify gaps in existing knowledge that will guide future research. This project will help inform the NCI in the planning and prioritizing future research initiatives developing patient-level risk prediction model to assist patients and clinicians in making informed decisions about the benefits and risks of adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide adequate equipment, supplies, facilities, and scientific materials necessary for carrying out the requirements of this project.  <br /><br />The Contractor shall work on several key tasks, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1.	Evaluate the literature on long-term adverse events following treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients draft a manuscript reporting the findings. <br />a.	 Specifically, information from published literature on chemotherapy agents commonly used in the U.S. for breast cancer adjuvant therapy (i.e., anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, taxanes, and trastuzumab) and the risk of chemotherapy-related adverse events (i.e., cardiac toxicity, ovarian failure, secondary malignancies, neurotoxicity, and cognitive dysfunction) will be systematically reviewed and described.  The completed manuscript shall be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. (Task 1)<br />2.	Conduct secondary analyses using data from the NSABP B-30 trial to estimate the frequency and impact of adverse events resulting from adjuvant chemotherapy and draft a manuscript reporting the findings.  <br />a.	Data from the NSABP B-30 trial, which enrolled over 5,000 node-positive breast cancer patients who were randomized to three different treatment arms containing an anthracycline and a taxane, shall be analyzed by the Contractor and shall supplement finding from the systematic review (Task  2). <br /><br />Government Responsibilities:<br /><br />The Contracting Officers Representative (COR) will review draft deliverables and provide the contractor with timely comments.  <br /><br />Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:<br /><br />The Contractor's work products shall be subject to the review and approval of the COR.  Any deficiencies identified must be corrected prior to final approval.  The COR will complete review of the work within 1 month.  If no comments or request for revisions are provided to the Contractor within 1 month, the deliverables will be considered acceptable.<br />Payment shall be made after acceptance by the Government of each deliverable.<br /><br />Period of performance: 12 months from the date of award.</p>
<p>How to Submit a Response:</p>

<DESC>The NAVFAC Expeditionary Programs Office requires maintenance and repairs of systems staged onboard the Maritime Prepositioned Force (MPF). The systems are the Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS), Amphibious Bulk Liquid Transfer System (ABLTS), Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM-8s), and Maritime Prepositioning Force Utility Boat (MPFUBs). The contractor will perform the maintenance, repair, limited technical inspection, and custody management of INLS, ABLTS, LCM-8s, and MPFUBs.

The MPF consists of two Maritime Prepositioned Ship (MPS) Squadrons: MPS Squadron Two, located at Diego Garcia; and MPS Squadron Three, in the Guam/Saipan area. The MPF squadrons consist of ten prepositioned ships with the subject systems stored on the weather decks.
  

MPF ships operate in three-year deployment cycles that include a return to CONUS (Continental United States) for major maintenance and supply refreshment.  This cycle is called the MPF Maintenance Cycle (MC) which includes an availability held every three years at Blount Island Command (BIC).  

The INLS is a system of steel modules that are interconnected by rigid and flexible connections.  The individual non-powered modules are nominally 80 long, 24 wide, and 8 deep.  

The ABLTS is a reel-laid buoyant hose system for fuel or water transfer.  The system has a total of three hose reels.  Two of the reels are capable of deploying 5,000 feet of 6-inch fuel hose; the third hose reel has 10,000 feet of 4-inch potable water hose.

<DESC><strong>I. General Information</strong>
<p>The Air Force Installation Contracting Agency, 338 Specialized Contracting Squadron (SCONS), [formerly the Air Education and Training Command Contracting Squadron (AETC CONS] is seeking information regarding the Compliance-Related and Disciplinary Zones of the Nitaqat (Zone) System as they relate to Saudi Commercial Business Licenses.

The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency except as indicated in paragraph III.</p>

<DESC><p class="Pa3" style="margin-bottom: 4.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking a commercialization partner for a technology to correct for patient or subject motion in tomographic imaging systems. The ORNL Technology Transfer Office will accept license applications through January 31, 2014.<br /><br />Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have developed a novel system to correct for motion when reconstructing tomographic images of human patients and un-anesthetized small laboratory animals. An optical tracking system measures the position of the patient or laboratory animal during a tomographic data acquisition and incorporates the position data in the image reconstruction.<br /><br />Applications for this technology include clinical and preclinical Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).  The technology has the potential to be extended to include X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).<br /><br /> License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology, with a preference for United States based businesses and small businesses.<br /><br />For additional information and a license application and selection criteria, contact Jennifer Caldwell, Group Leader, Technology Commercialization, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 865-574-4180, caldwelljt@ornl.gov.<br /><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><br />Technology intellectual property summaries, publications, etc. can be found here:</span></span></p>

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM, AFISRA ombudsmen, or<br />AFNWC Ombudsmen:</p>

Synopsis:

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective June 5, 2013 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 073 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

<DESC>Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Please note with this refresh you must complete the mandatory Readiness Assessment free self evaluation, available on the Vendor Support Center website at https://vsc.gsa.gov. From the VSC home page, click on Toolbox in the upper left corner and complete the Research, Analyze, and Decide modules. The Decide module contains a questionnaire that must be completed by an officer of the company (President, VP, CEO, CFO, etc.) and must be submitted with your offer in order to gain consideration.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION:  Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity Architect and Engineering Services Contract.

Selection of a firm is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather the process for A-E firm selection described in FAR Part 36 using the competitive ranking of firms based upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services, as more fully set forth in the selection criteria.  The competitive ranking will be followed by a negotiation with the most highly ranked firm and continuing to lower ranked firms only if satisfactory terms are not reached with the preferred firm as described in FAR 36.606. The A-E firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently.  All firms responding to this announcement are cautioned to review FAR 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of interest; and FAR 36.209 - Construction Contracts with Architect-Engineer firms.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. 
If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as:THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 30 DEC 13 08:00PM.

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose.

The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK DECEMBER 19, 2013<br />REQUISITION NUMBER: NCNM7300-14-00259<br />OFFICE FURNITURE MOVE TO HILO, HAWAI&lsquo;I FOR<br />PAPAH&#256;NAUMOKU&#256;KEA MARINE NATIONAL MONUMENT<br />Introduction<br />The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a United States Federal agency dedicated to understanding and predicting changes in the Earth's environment and to conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet United States economic, social, and environmental needs. NOAA is the steward of national coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine protected areas as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.</p>
<p>The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS), established in 1972 by the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) and administered by NOAA, protects a network of special marine and freshwater areas. The goal of the NMSA is to set aside and manage areas for resource protection, research, enhanced public education, and compatible public and private uses. Management activities for each sanctuary are detailed in site-specific management plans which outline regulatory goals, describe boundaries, identify staffing and budget needs, set priorities and performance measures for resource protection, research, and education programs.</p>
<p>In 2001, NOAA initiated a process to consider designating the waters surrounding the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) as a National Marine Sanctuary. On June 15, 2006, George Bush established the Papah&#257;naumoku&#257;kea Marine National Monument (Monument) by Proclamation 8031 to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and lasting protection of the coral reef ecosystem and related marine resources and species of the region. These waters contain a large portion of all coral reefs found in the United States' jurisdiction and support more than 7,000 marine species, of which one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands chain. The 1,200-mile stretch of remote islands, atolls and reefs, is also one the most remote archipelagos in the world.</p>
<p>At a time when ocean resources around the world are in major decline, the designation of the Monument enabled nearly 140,000 square miles of the region to receive the highest form of marine environmental protection in the United States, creating one of the largest protected marine areas in the world.</p>
<p>On July 30, 2010, the Monument was inscribed as a mixed World Heritage Site for its outstanding natural and cultural attributes. A designation of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), World Heritage sites safeguard for humanity the most universal and significant aspects of our global natural and cultural heritage.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK DECEMBER 19, 2013<br />REQUISITION NUMBER: NCNM7300-14-00259<br />OFFICE FURNITURE MOVE TO HILO, HAWAI&lsquo;I FOR<br />PAPAH&#256;NAUMOKU&#256;KEA MARINE NATIONAL MONUMENT<br />Introduction<br />The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a United States Federal agency dedicated to understanding and predicting changes in the Earth's environment and to conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet United States economic, social, and environmental needs. NOAA is the steward of national coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine protected areas as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.</p>
<p>The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS), established in 1972 by the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) and administered by NOAA, protects a network of special marine and freshwater areas. The goal of the NMSA is to set aside and manage areas for resource protection, research, enhanced public education, and compatible public and private uses. Management activities for each sanctuary are detailed in site-specific management plans which outline regulatory goals, describe boundaries, identify staffing and budget needs, set priorities and performance measures for resource protection, research, and education programs.</p>
<p>In 2001, NOAA initiated a process to consider designating the waters surrounding the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) as a National Marine Sanctuary. On June 15, 2006, George Bush established the Papah&#257;naumoku&#257;kea Marine National Monument (Monument) by Proclamation 8031 to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and lasting protection of the coral reef ecosystem and related marine resources and species of the region. These waters contain a large portion of all coral reefs found in the United States' jurisdiction and support more than 7,000 marine species, of which one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands chain. The 1,200-mile stretch of remote islands, atolls and reefs, is also one the most remote archipelagos in the world.</p>
<p>At a time when ocean resources around the world are in major decline, the designation of the Monument enabled nearly 140,000 square miles of the region to receive the highest form of marine environmental protection in the United States, creating one of the largest protected marine areas in the world.</p>
<p>On July 30, 2010, the Monument was inscribed as a mixed World Heritage Site for its outstanding natural and cultural attributes. A designation of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), World Heritage sites safeguard for humanity the most universal and significant aspects of our global natural and cultural heritage.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

The Baseline Repair Parts List will serve as a basis for a contract modification that will be negotiated after First Article testing is passed adding all required Baseline Repair parts to the contract. <br>  <br> Full text of the amended synopsis follows: <br>  <br> The United States Army Contracting Command at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, 21005 intends to release a Request for Proposal, (RFP), in second quarter FY14, meaning January or February 2014.

The Solicitation will instruct the offerors that the Government is seeking only Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U unique parts and those common items, such as those that can be ordered from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) or elsewhere in the Government's supply chain, are not desired by the Government.  In no event will the additional costs associated with those items increase the overall ceiling price of the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract beyond that specified in the documentation supporting the Government's approval to enter into this contract.  Additionally, the Government reserves the right to order common parts from DLA notwithstanding their potential inclusion in the contract being solicited here at some point during contract performance.   <br>    <br> The tactical power supplies furnish 0-25 amperes over a voltage range of 24 to 32VDC from nominal 115/230 VAC at 50, 60 or 400 Hz single phase.

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor Wisconsin Physicians(WPS)under the current contract number HHSM-500-2011-M0006Z in the amount of $486,129 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. <br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC><p class="Pa3" style="margin-bottom: 4.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking a commercialization partner for a technology to correct for patient or subject motion in tomographic imaging systems. The ORNL Technology Transfer Office will accept license applications through January 31, 2014.<br /><br />Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have developed a novel system to correct for motion when reconstructing tomographic images of human patients and un-anesthetized small laboratory animals. An optical tracking system measures the position of the patient or laboratory animal during a tomographic data acquisition and incorporates the position data in the image reconstruction.<br /><br />Applications for this technology include clinical and preclinical Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).  The technology has the potential to be extended to include X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).<br /><br /> License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology, with a preference for United States based businesses and small businesses.<br /><br />For additional information and a license application and selection criteria, contact Jennifer Caldwell, Group Leader, Technology Commercialization, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 865-574-4180, caldwelljt@ornl.gov.<br /><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><br />Technology intellectual property summaries, publications, etc. can be found here:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/licensing-opportunity-announcements/motion-corrected-tomographic-images">http://www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/licensing-opportunity-announcements/motion-corrected-tomographic-images</a>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<DESC><p><strong>U.S. Department of Labor<br />SMALL BUSINESS VENDOR OUTREACH SESSION</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTERESTED IN INTRODUCING YOUR COMPANY TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR? <br /></strong>To increase the U.S. Department of Labor's utilization of all types of small businesses, the Department's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) sponsors small business Vendor Outreach Sessions (VOS). These sessions offer small businesses the opportunity to market their capabilities directly to agency program officials and learn about potential&nbsp;DOL procurement opportunities. Conversely, Department procurement officials can learn more about the diverse small business resources available to meet their procurement needs.&nbsp; Department of Labor agencies buy a wide variety of goods and services valued at approximately $1.9 billion each year. Each DOL agency has a responsibility for procuring its own goods and services in support of the agency's mission. <br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>GENERAL PROCEDURES<br /></strong>Vendor Outreach Sessions are held in the Department of Labor Great Hall&nbsp;from 9:00 a.m. until 12 noon. Online registration will be available approximately&nbsp;30 days prior to each session. The address is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">U.S. Department of Labor <br />Frances Perkins Building (Great Hall)<br />200 Constitution Avenue, NW (between 2nd and 3rd Streets, NW) <br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow-up meetings with agency representatives may be scheduled for a later date, if mutually agreed upon.</p>

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition



1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 12, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 115 South 84th Street, Milwaukee, WI 53214

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the consignment of coronary balloon catheters for Jesse Brown VAMC.  The procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with Boston Scientific. This will be a new firm fixed price IDIQ contract for a one (1) year base period with four (4) one year option periods.  

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The Jesse Brown VAMC requires coronary balloon catheters to be available on a consignment basis for patient care.  The estimated quantity is 150 per year with an estimated value of $35,000 per year (total contract value is $175,000.00).  The Balloon Catheters will be purchased by credit card transaction after use and a replacement will be sent to the consignment inventory within a 24 hour period.  Period of performance for base year: October 28, 2013 through October 27, 2014 (approximate) 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 13.501(a), Simplified Acquisition (Test Program)                     
            Sole Source and 38 U.S.C.  8123 Procurement of Prosthetic Appliances

	          
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

Surgically implanted products (prostheses) are specified by the clinical team to meet the unique and comprehensive needs of each Veteran with an identified medical indication.  The specific product described above has been determined by the clinical team to be the best product to treat the Veteran patient's medical condition and functional limitations.  Full and open competition for the above described implant negates the clinician's subject matter expertise as related to the medical treatment for the individual Veteran.  In this case, the brand name device is the specific prescription and method of treatment for the Veteran patient.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  This procurement is specific to Boston Scientific's coronary balloon catheters under the authority of 38 U.S.C.  8123, Procurement of Prosthetic Appliances.

Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The contractor provided Special Government Courtesy Pricing currently being used for all VA and DOD facilities without any volume or compliance requirement.  There is no optional or alternative pricing.  This pricing has been determined to be fair and reasonable by the VA and DOD facilities per FAR 13.106-3(a).

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research was not conducted based on the medical determination described above.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  VAAR 806.302-5(b)(1) allows an exception to full and open competition for prosthetic appliances in accordance with 38 U.S.C.  8123.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  N/A

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  None

Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as the Contracting Officer, hereby approve this exception to fair opportunity pursuant to the authority of FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C).</p>
<p>1. REQUIRING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING OFFICE:</p>
<p>Requiring Agency: Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) <br />Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC)</p>
<p>Contracting Office: Defense Information Systems Agency/Defense Information Technology<br />Contracting Office (DITCO)</p>
<p>2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S): <br />This modification increases the scope of the task to support the JITC with technical testing of radios which includes additional travel requirements. The initial proposal requested by the Government assumed a level of effort sufficient to cover three customers a year. These initial projections were based on historical testing data at the time, and the increase in demand was not<br />anticipated. The level of effort was increased by the Government, during the base period, to cover five customer tests. The latest projection for the first option period has approximately 10 customers requesting test support.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:</p>
<p>Testing of Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) for Standards Conformance Testing (SCT) Certification requires 2 months in the lab and 1 month report preparation. Estimated value is REMOVED. Support to the Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) is comprised of ad hoc test and evaluation support (training users, evaluating Network Manager's upgrades, analyzing and evaluating problems from fielded units, and supporting working groups in the development of new waveform specifications). Historically, the task has been funded for 50% of the fiscal year. However with this large ramp up of other customers' testing the JTNC support has been backed off to 30%. Estimated value is REMOVED. This support is performed out of the JITC Networking lab in San Diego, California. Other waveform tests (SINCGARS, HaveQuick, Link 16 and Legacy Interoperability assessments) conducted under this task are much shorter in duration; nominally four weeks test and two weeks reporting. Estimated value of each test is REMOVED. These are generally conducted out of the JITC Ft Huachuca, Arizona lab. Extimated value of the entire task is now REMOVED.</p>
<p>4. SUPPORTING RATIONALE, INCLUDING A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY: <br /><br />(a) Exception to Fair Opportunity. IAW FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C): The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical modification to an order already issued under the contract, and all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.<br /><br />(b) Description of the Justification. The Test &amp; Evaluation Joint Tactical Networks Center (JTNC)/Waveform (WF) Standards Conformance Testing (SCT) task order was awarded as a cost plus fixed fee task order to TASC on 3 January 2013 following a fair opportunity competition using the JITC T&amp;E MSS IDIQ contracts. The awarded contract was modified on 21 March 2013, Modification 01 to include additional testing and travel requirements. It was modified again on 18 June 2013, Modification 05 to include additional testing subtasks. Finally, it was modified on 4 December 2013, Modification 08 to include additional testing for additional customers. Because the additional tasks falls in scope with the current JTNC/WFSCT task, the logical modification is to an order already issued under the current contract.</p>
<p><br />Justification: Since the increase in demand falls under the purview of an existing task where efficiencies and processes have been developed, it is in the best interest of the Government to complete the additional tests under the existing task. This particular radio testing requires expertise that is not typically available through the set of JITC contractors. Of the initial seven contractors available to bid on this task only three actually submitted proposals. Only TASC was technically acceptable, and it was also the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable. The initial request to bid was only 10 months ago and it is not expected that recompeting the task would provide a more cost effective option.</p>
<p>If the Government were to bring in another contractor, all the experience and knowledge gained from contractor TASC would be lost. The time to recompete, hire and retrain new contractor employees on the highly technical, diverse radio waveforms: Wideband Networking Waveform, Soldier Radio Waveform, Link-16, SINCGARS, HaveQuick, and newest satellite mode Mobile<br />Users Objective System requirements and protocols, would take an additional REMOVED and cost approximately REMOVED for labor and would impact five JITC customers with an unacceptably long delay in their testing. This is in addition to the amount of labor it takes to perform the testing. This increased labor cost would not be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>5. COST/PRICE FAIR AND REASONABLE DETERMINATION: Rates have been established with the basic contract. All rates set forth in the contract, and used on individual task orders, were based on full and open competition and a price analysis was accomplished. Proposed task order rates and loadings will be compare with the basic contract rates and loadings and verified as fair and reasonable. The total estimated value for this requirement is REMOVED (Total estimated proposal value, including options.)</p>
<p>6. MARKET RESEARCH: Full and open competition in Nov/Dec 2012 made the Government aware of the capabilities and costs of the other JITC contractors. This task was competed with all seven contractors under the Test &amp; Evaluation Mission Support Services IDIQ contract and awarded in Jan 2013. The existing competitive sources (three T&amp;E MSS contractors) have been evaluated within the last ten months. Both OBERON and ALION clearly did not understand the technical requirements of conducting a radio's waveform Standards Conformance Test. Only TASC was deemed technically acceptable. Since the original award, the technical requirements have further increased to include Link-16, SINCGARS, and HaveQuick waveforms. These requirements were added during the base period due to an unforeseen customer demand for this testing. The contractor TASC was able to accommodate these additional test requirements due to their available, highly skilled, and experienced technical workforce. This J&amp;A is required for an increase in funding, not because of more new technologies, but rather an increase in the numbers of customers requesting testing support.</p>
<p>7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: The WNW, SRW, Link 16 and JTNC testing performed serially comes to approximately REMOVED. Resource constraints and parallel testing will in reality bring the cost closer to REMOVED. A REMOVED savings that cannot be accurately reflected in the proposal.</p>
<p>8. ACTIONS THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY:</p>
<p>(a) Procurement History. <br />Task Order HC1028-12-D-0024-0027 was awarded on 3 January 2013. The original RFP was competed and awarded for a total cost of REMOVED. This increase has occurred based on two previous change scopes. The increase for Modification 1 (REMOVED) and Modification 5 (REMOVED) totaled to REMOVED. This modification increases the task estimated cost by REMOVED and a J&amp;A was approved with the current change scope (Modification 6). To date the total increase of the task is REMOVED which equates to a 29% increase of the total task amount.</p>
<p>9. REFERENCE TO THE APPROVED ACQUISITION PLAN (AP):</p>
<p>N/A. This requirement does not require a written acquisition plan.</p>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Network 23 Contracting Office (NCO 23) - Sioux Falls, 2501 W. 22nd Street, Sioux Falls SD 57105; 636-14-1-2301-0033

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This will be a fixed priced contract with U.S. Arkray Inc, who will provide a Service Agreement for three (3) Arkray Automated Urine Chemistry Analyzers for the Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System (NWIHCS) locations of Omaha, Lincoln, and Grand Island VA Health Care Systems.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  Provide all tools, test equipment, original equipment manufacturer parts, labor and transportation to implement a full Service Agreement for three (3) ARKAY Automated Urine Chemistry Analyzer, Model AX4280, Serial Numbers 40706077, 40706079 and 40706080 located at the Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System (NWIHCS) locations of Omaha, Lincoln, and Grand Island VA Health Care Systems. The Service Agreement will include emergent services and regularly scheduled maintenance inspections to include parts replacement as described in the original manufacturer's service manual.  The Base Year coverage period will be from December 30, 2013 through December 29, 2014 and include two (2) option years. There is no government furnished property. The annual estimated cost is $12,450.00 per year and the total contract cost is $37,350.00.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:

(X) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  The vendor ARKRAY is the original manufacturer of the unit and therefore has the necessary procedures, parts and proprietary software to maintain the unit as is required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for original manufacturer's specifications as defined by the FDA 510K approval.  A previous vendor (IRIS was at one time licensed to provide service, but that vendor was bought out by Beckman Coulter who no longer has the approval to provide service for the unit.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Internet research did not identify any other vendor offering the required services. Additional market research with the Biomedical Technician was conducted and no other vendor was identified that is capable of providing the required services. Given the urgency of the procurement, it was determined additional research would not yield any other vendor capable of providing the required services.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The cost of service for all three units is anticipated to be $12,450.00 per year and is compared to past pricing on station Purchase Order 636SM3369. Even though the previous vendor was listed as IRIS and has subsequently been sold to another firm, the past price was deemed fair and reasonable.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was conducted using GSA advantage and via search engines on the world-wide web.   No other vendor was found in the United States that could perform the required services.  The only vendor found that could have possibly offered services was not an authorized service partner (ESBE) and was based in Canada.  The Canadian firm stated that they are not authorized to provide service in the U.S. and that only ARKRAY could provide the service.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  NONE

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Future procurements for servicing the ARKRAY urine analyzer will again have market research performed to ensure no other vendor could maintain the units.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
