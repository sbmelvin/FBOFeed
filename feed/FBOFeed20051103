<DESC>Description The Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Management Consolidated Business Center (EMCBC) Office of Contracting, intends to issue a sole source modification for interim requirements for a period up to twelve months pending completion of a competitive acquisition to safely and economically maintain and monitor the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP).  To perform facilities operation and site support services which include the following: operate the Remote Handled Waste Facility (RHWF); characterize, process, package and ship for disposal legacy low level waste (LLW) and waste generated as a result of other activities conducted under the Statement of Work; maintain and monitor facilities; and continue to store the high level waste (HLW) canisters in the Main Plant Process Building in a manner that is safe and compliant with DOE requirements. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The present contract is with the West Valley Nuclear Services Company and is due to expire on December 31, 2005.  Site services need to continue without disruption in order to assure the protection of the workers, the public, and the environment.  The shipment of legacy LLW and operation of RHWF are necessary to meet the requirements of the WVDP Act and maintain the qualified and experienced workforce.  Therefore, this necessitates the award of a sole source modification/extension to the incumbent contractor, West Valley Nuclear Services Company.  The intent of this sole source procurement is to provide the necessary site services from January 1, 2006 for up to 12 months until award and transition to competitive contract(s) for site services occurs.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE RECEIVING RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE OF A NON-COMPETITIVE ACTION. IF PARTIES CHOOSE TO RESPOND, ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONDENT AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Interested parties believing they have all the capabilities described above may submit capability statements to be received within 5 days of publication of this notice. Any such responses should be directed to U.S. Department of Energy, 175 Tri-County Parkway, Springdale, OH 45246-3222, Attention: Derrick J. C. Franklin.

1. SCOPE.
This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required to obtain specialized support to integrate the requirements of PEO STRI within the Army's requirements and resource processes to ensure the needs of PEO STRI are adequately considered within the Army, Congress, and surrounding community. Prerequisites for this process are a command strategy that closely aligns PEO STRI’s vision with the Army's vision, Acquisition Support Centers (ASC) vision, with the transformation of the Army and a strategic linkage to each organization that impacts PEO STRI.

1.1 Background. The PEO of PEO STRI in Orlando, Florida, requires support to effectively and efficiently impact the resource and planning processes of the Army and other Services which support PEO STRI. Additionally, assistance is needed to ensure PEO STRI’s capabilities are widely understood and routinely considered in the acquisition process.

1.2 This Statement of Work describes a performance based work environment in terms of “what” the required service outputs are rather than “how” to perform the work. The service provider is encouraged to strive for constant improvement and innovation in the performance of this contract as long as the performance objectives are being achieved at the desired levels of performance. Successfully identifying and applying best practices can reduce business expenses and improve customer satisfaction. The service provider is required to manage the quality of the services delivered using their internal management structure.  This SOW attempts to create a government-service provider relationship that promotes achievement of mutually beneficial goals, and promotes a partnership environment. The success of this contract is dependent upon free and open communication between the government and the service provider. The ultimate goal of this SOW is for the service provider to establish a quality customer-focused multifunctional team meeting the needs of PEO STRI.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Technology Transition and Concept Development Division, AAC/XRS, intends to solicit and award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Ellwood National Forge Company, Irvine, PA to produce 20 BLU-121/B warhead cases from Eglin Steel (ES-1C).  This requirement can only be met by Ellwood National Forge Company because they are the only producer of ES-1C steel that consistently meets the Government’s requirements and that can machine the BLU-121/B bomb case in accordance with the applicable drawing.  The Contractor will qualify the steel material for each warhead case by conducting a suite of mechanical property tests on heat-treated specimens obtained from the case material and providing the results to the Government.  If multiple cases come from a single ingot, all cases from that ingot can be qualified from a single suite of mechanical property specimens.

The test specimens should be prepared as follows:  heat-treat a minimum of one qualification sample from each forged ingot.  These samples will be heat-treated in the same furnace that is used to heat-treat the warhead.  Two pieces of steel, each approximating the mass of a BLU-121/B warhead, should be heat-treated along with the qualification samples to simulate a typical heat-treat load.  The Contractor will test three tensile and six Charpy impact specimens from each ingot and provide the results to AAC/XRS.  

The Government reserves the right to conduct its own suite of property tests to validate samples taken.

The required properties to be obtained from the specimen tests are listed below.  The “Single Test Minimum” refers to the minimum properties for any single test specimen.  The “Average” refers to the minimum average of at least three test specimens from any single qualification sample.

Qualification Test Properties:  Single Test Minimum/Average (of at least 3) - - Ultimate Tensile Strength:  min Yu = 240 ksi/avg Yu = 244ksi;  Static Yield Strength: min Ys = 188 ksi/avg Ys = 192 ksi; % Strain to Failure: min Sf  = 12.0%/avg Sf  = 13.0%; Charpy Impact (at -40ºF): min CI = 16 ft-lbs/avg CI = 19 ft-lbs. 

The AF Contracting Officer, or her representative, will notify the contractor of any  ingot or bomb case failing to meet minimum properties and unacceptable under this contract.   

The contractor shall measure the mass and center of gravity of each warhead in both unassembled and fully-assembled states and deliver the resulting data.  Weight limits should fall within the acceptable CG limits of a MK-84.  Cases are to be delivered to the government NLT 15 July 2006.

The technical data package is undergoing revisions and is not available at this time.  The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement.  The AAC Ombudsman is Col Susan Mashiko, AAC/DC(S), 101 West “D” Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL  32542, (850) 882-0662, susan.mashiko@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training System Division (TSD) in Orlando, FL, intends to award a follow-on sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQC) to the SkillsNET Corporation, 3295 North Hwy. 77, Waxahachie, Texas 75165 to acquire a commercial-off-the-shelf Skills Management System (SMS) software application suite and associated operation, maintenance, analysis, training, and technical support services to support the Navy’s migration from task-centric personnel management system to Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA)-centric system.

The Contractor will be required to provide a suite of commercially available web-based tools and corresponding technical services for the collection, validation, analysis, and management, and maintenance of skill and task data for both occupational and non-occupational work in accordance with nationally accepted methods for occupational analysis and standards development.  The processes and methods used by the tools shall be based on accepted industrial/organizational psychology to collect reliable and validated data; utilize principles of human behavior to categorize job behaviors; utilize well-defined taxonomies to identify and quantify knowledge, skills, abilities, and tools required for work; utilize science of survey population sampling, survey design, and survey delivery; adhere to legal requirements regarding employment discrimination and legally defensible occupational data; and be based on and compatible with the Department of Labor’s O*NET directory of occupational descriptions.  

The Contractor will be required to provide skill analysts certified in the use of tools and processes to assist the Navy with its ongoing Total Force occupational data capture and analysis efforts.  The Total Force encompass all Navy personnel – Enlisted, Officers (Active and Reserve, Afloat and Ashore components), Civilians (Government and Contractor).  

The resulting Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be issued using other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Pursuing award through competition would result in substantial duplication of costs that the Government would not recover through competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling critical mission requirements, potentially leading to the unavailability of the SMS.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611, with a small business size standard not to exceed $6,000,000.  

The anticipated contract award date for the SMS contract is 27 January 2005.  This is not a request for quotation, nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD) intends to enter into negotiations with the SkillsNET Corporation ten (10) business days after publication of this notice.  Questions regarding the requisite technical capabilities of the product or services being acquired through this sole source acquisition may be directed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Katherine Holcomb, e-mail address: katherine.holcomb@navy.mil or NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD), 12350 Research Parkway, Attn: Katherine Holcomb Code 25333, Orlando, FL 32826.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Ancillary services for architecture, landscaping, historical preservation and archaeological investigations may also be needed as a subset to HTRW mitigation.  (3) SELECTION CRITERIA: Primary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Specialized experience and technical competence: [FAR 36.602-1(a)(2)].  Responding firms should demonstrate experience durin g the past five (5) years.  The board will evaluate the specialized experience on projects and the technical capabilities of the prime firm and any subcontractors.  The effectiveness of the proposed project team (including management structure, coordinatio n of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors; and prior working relationships) will also be examined.  State whether the experience is that of the prime (or joint venture), consultant or an individual.  Work cited that is experience of prime (or joint venture) from an office other than that identified shall be so labeled.  Specialized experience to be evaluated for this project is as follows (all specialized e xperience factors are listed in descending order of importance):  (a) investigation, planning, design, and construction phase services for a variety of hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste cleanup projects.  Experience must demonstrate wide-ranging capa bilities for diverse projects with differing contaminants in various media;  (b) adherence to regulations and practices pertaining to hazardous waste sampling, handling, transportation and disposal.  Knowledge of local and state environmental regulations a nd experience dealing with local and State regulatory entities; (c) oversight of RI, FS, RD, RA, and LTRA performed by other parties, in conformance to their respective consent decrees or administrative orders negotiated with EPA; (d) demonstrated quality management procedures.  Include a proposed organizational chart and a narrative description of how the quality management procedures will function to include internal quality control and who is responsible.  (2) Professional Qualifications [FAR 36.602-1(a) (1)].  The board will evaluate, as appropriate, the education, training, registration, overall and relevant experience, longevity with the firm, and experience working together of key management and technical personnel.  This criterion is primarily concern ed with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under the capacity criterion.  Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications in these primary disciplines, which are listed in descend ing order of importance.  List professional registrations for the disciplines: (a) Environmental engineering; (b) Chemical process engineering; (c) Chemistry; (d) Risk Assessment; (e) Hydrogeology; (f) Civil Engineering; (g) Geotechnical engineering; (h) I ndustrial hygiene; (i) Health physics; (j) Cost engineering; (k) Geology; (l) Archaeology; (m) Mechanical engineering; (n) Electrical engineering; (o) Architecture/Landscape Planning.  (3) Past Performance [FAR 36.602-1(a)(4)].  ACASS is the primary source  of information on past performance.  ACASS will be queried for all firms submitting a proposal.  When deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant subcontractors who have previously been prime A-E contractors may  also be considered.  The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm if none is available from ACASS.  The board will consider the relevancy of each per formance evaluation to the proposed contract, including the type of work, performing office, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firms performance.  A firm that has earned excellent evaluations on recent DoD A- E contracts for similar projects will be ranked relatively high on past performance.  (4) Capacity [FAR 36.602-1(a)(3)].  The board will consider a firms available capacity of key disciplines to perform work in the required time.  The board will also cons ider the prime firm and its consultants in the offices proposed to perform the work in relationship to the firms current workloads.    (5) Knowledge Of The Locality [FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)].  The board will evaluate a firms familiarity with local conditions.   Examples include knowledge of, and experience dealing with, the state and local regulatory agencies, geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique.  Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispers ed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities.  The overall most highly qualified firms will not be reject ed solely in the interest of equitable distribution of contracts.  Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months.  Please indicate all Task Orders an d Modifications awarded your firm by DoD agencies within the last twelve (12) months under an indefinite delivery type contract.

<DESC>USAID intends to issue an RFP for construction services for street/road construction, rehabilitation and or repair in the West Bank and Gaza. Proposals will be sought from American and Local Palestinian Grade 1,Class A construction contractors for these construction services. 

USAID proposes to finance the construction of selected priority road segments in Gaza and the West Bank in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Planning and Ministry of Public Works & Housing as well as Local Governments. This project is part of the US led effort to support the Road Map for Peace in the Middle East. The restoration of roads improve access to markets and the movement of labor and goods and the Palestinian construction industry receives an economic boost. Road        restoration also opens job opportunities, increases the amount of materials supplied, and stimulates the manufacturing sector.

Although this solicitation will be open to U.S. Firms, current travel restrictions prohibit entry into Gaza by contractors' expatriate personnel who are U..S. citizens, U.S.- Palestinian dual citizens or third country nationals. U.S. Firms are also reminded of the restriction imposed by AIDAR 725.703(b), which requires at least 50% of the supervisory and key personnel working at the project site to be citizens or legal residents of the United States. No Exceptions will be authorized The selected contractors must be able to mobilize quickly and must have similar construction  experience and demonstrated capability of

<DESC>Support Services for Comprehensive Cost and Requirements (CCaR) System SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) This synopsis is issued to conduct market research for informational and  planning purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential  sources capable of meeting the requirements of Aeronautical System Center,  Comptroller Directorate (ASC/FM), located at Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433.  Services, detailed below, include providing a wide range of support related to  the use, operation, training, maintenance and improvement of the CCaR  application, in both Program Offices or Wings/Groups/Squadrons and at the  Staff level. ASC utilizes the client-server and web versions of CCaR, so  services required are applicable to both versions. Contractor support  personnel are expected to be expert in all facets of CCaR functionality and  operation. Contractor support personnel must also be familiar with the  applications and systems with which CCaR interfaces. Contractor support  personnel must demonstrate familiarity with:  DFAS BQ and MOCAS systems, and  Air Force CRIS, ConWrite + SMART systems. Contractor support personnel must be  capable of teaching all aspects of CCaR utilization to all ASC personnel, with  ability to recommend how CCaR should be employed to best support the unique  mission requirements of every ASC office. Contractor support personnel must  have a means of staying proficient with current CCaR functionality, which has  three major releases every year and maintenance releases once a month.  Responses must clearly address the ability to provide all services, identified  below. Contractor support personnel must have knowledge in Air Force  accounting + finance, financial management, contracts management and program  management, to include knowledge of DOD’s Planning, Programming, Budgeting,  Execution (PPBE) process and knowledge of Air Force Weapon System Acquisition  process, as CCaR supports a significant number of acquisition and functional  processes and products for both USAF and Foreign Military Sales. Contractor  support personnel must have a current security clearance at the Secret level.  ASC’s workload fluctuates over time and any responses must address the ability  to respond in a reasonable amount of time to additional requirements for  contractor support. Of particular importance, each response must clearly elucidate and expound  upon the approach, technique and any ancillary relationships, contract  agreements or vehicles, etc. which they have with Integrated Data Service  (IDS). IDS is the developer of CCaRS, and currently provides both maintenance,  change management, configuration control, design, development, testing and  installation of the CCaR application, all CCaR modules, Looking Glass data  warehouse for the client-server and web versions along with web part design,  development and test and installation of production software products.  Responses must clearly indicate how their employees acquire knowledge, skills,  abilities and training on all CCaR applications and related products.  Demonstration of a seamless process of working with IDS is paramount, as  contractor support personnel have been and are expected to be, very  knowledgeable and familiar with the CCaR application and related products.  Specifically address how employees receive training initially and continually  as major functionality releases occur three times a year. Specifically address  how contractor support personnel will work with USAF and FMS customers in  regards to problems, bugs, enhancements and in turn work with IDS for  resolution to problems and bugs. Also address the process by which contractor  support personnel will clearly communicate the functionality needs of their  customers. Contractor support personnel will be involved with testing new  functionality. Address the process by which prospective contractor support  personnel are evaluated for having an affinity to grasp new concepts, new  processes and new tools. Clearly demonstrate a seamless process between  yourself and IDS which shows how the Air Force will not be responsible for  managing the relationship between these parties in order to provide  outstanding customer support, resulting in successful utilization of CCaR to  support weapon system acquisition offices. Contractor support personnel must demonstrate an understanding of all  functionality as documented in the CCaR users’ manual. CCaR is a relational  database application. Contractor support personnel must understand how  relational databases function so they can properly configure and maintain the  database front end through the Supervisor’s screen processes, and instruct  their customers in the proper procedures for utilizing any of the  functionality inherent in the database. Clearly demonstrate an understanding of the following CCaR functionality on  the part of your company in general and specifically your employees, who would  be providing CCaR support.  Contractor support personnel need to understand  the following functionality so they are the CCaR expert within their assigned  office and have the ability to explain the functionality to their  customers/CCaR users. •	CCaR Modes •	Custom system tailoring •	Requirements Tracking •	Automated funding status •	Electronic workflow •	Funding document generation •	ABSS Interface •	BQ Interface

<DESC>Support Services for Comprehensive Cost and Requirements (CCaR) System SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) This synopsis is issued to conduct market research for informational and  planning purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential  sources capable of meeting the requirements of Aeronautical System Center,  Comptroller Directorate (ASC/FM), located at Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433.  Services, detailed below, include providing a wide range of support related to  the use, operation, training, maintenance and improvement of the CCaR  application, in both Program Offices or Wings/Groups/Squadrons and at the  Staff level. ASC utilizes the client-server and web versions of CCaR, so  services required are applicable to both versions. Contractor support  personnel are expected to be expert in all facets of CCaR functionality and  operation. Contractor support personnel must also be familiar with the  applications and systems with which CCaR interfaces. Contractor support  personnel must demonstrate familiarity with:  DFAS BQ and MOCAS systems, and  Air Force CRIS, ConWrite + SMART systems. Contractor support personnel must be  capable of teaching all aspects of CCaR utilization to all ASC personnel, with  ability to recommend how CCaR should be employed to best support the unique  mission requirements of every ASC office. Contractor support personnel must  have a means of staying proficient with current CCaR functionality, which has  three major releases every year and maintenance releases once a month.  Responses must clearly address the ability to provide all services, identified  below. Contractor support personnel must have knowledge in Air Force  accounting + finance, financial management, contracts management and program  management, to include knowledge of DOD’s Planning, Programming, Budgeting,  Execution (PPBE) process and knowledge of Air Force Weapon System Acquisition  process, as CCaR supports a significant number of acquisition and functional  processes and products for both USAF and Foreign Military Sales. Contractor  support personnel must have a current security clearance at the Secret level.  ASC’s workload fluctuates over time and any responses must address the ability  to respond in a reasonable amount of time to additional requirements for  contractor support. Of particular importance, each response must clearly elucidate and expound  upon the approach, technique and any ancillary relationships, contract  agreements or vehicles, etc. which they have with Integrated Data Service  (IDS). IDS is the developer of CCaRS, and currently provides both maintenance,  change management, configuration control, design, development, testing and  installation of the CCaR application, all CCaR modules, Looking Glass data  warehouse for the client-server and web versions along with web part design,  development and test and installation of production software products.  Responses must clearly indicate how their employees acquire knowledge, skills,  abilities and training on all CCaR applications and related products.  Demonstration of a seamless process of working with IDS is paramount, as  contractor support personnel have been and are expected to be, very  knowledgeable and familiar with the CCaR application and related products.  Specifically address how employees receive training initially and continually  as major functionality releases occur three times a year. Specifically address  how contractor support personnel will work with USAF and FMS customers in  regards to problems, bugs, enhancements and in turn work with IDS for  resolution to problems and bugs. Also address the process by which contractor  support personnel will clearly communicate the functionality needs of their  customers. Contractor support personnel will be involved with testing new  functionality. Address the process by which prospective contractor support  personnel are evaluated for having an affinity to grasp new concepts, new  processes and new tools. Clearly demonstrate a seamless process between  yourself and IDS which shows how the Air Force will not be responsible for  managing the relationship between these parties in order to provide  outstanding customer support, resulting in successful utilization of CCaR to  support weapon system acquisition offices. Contractor support personnel must demonstrate an understanding of all  functionality as documented in the CCaR users’ manual. CCaR is a relational  database application. Contractor support personnel must understand how  relational databases function so they can properly configure and maintain the  database front end through the Supervisor’s screen processes, and instruct  their customers in the proper procedures for utilizing any of the  functionality inherent in the database. Clearly demonstrate an understanding of the following CCaR functionality on  the part of your company in general and specifically your employees, who would  be providing CCaR support.  Contractor support personnel need to understand  the following functionality so they are the CCaR expert within their assigned  office and have the ability to explain the functionality to their  customers/CCaR users. •	CCaR Modes •	Custom system tailoring •	Requirements Tracking •	Automated funding status •	Electronic workflow •	Funding document generation •	ABSS Interface •	BQ Interface

Submittal in advance will  ensure that questions can be answered in a timely manner during the  Industry Day.

Note: New buyer Theresa  Hay replaces Michelle Hendricks on all future correspondence.  ************************************************************************  Update 30 Sep 2005 - Re-Send to Fed Biz Opps - Organizational Conflict of  Interest The Fed Business Opportunities site can not handle the  Description in excess of 24000 characters so the original Sources Sought  announcement of 17 May has been saved as a WORD file and loaded to the  XR-SIMAF PIXS library below as  "ORIGINAL_SOURCES_SOUGHT_ANNOUNCEMENT_17MAY05". NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ***********************************************************************  Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices.  **********************************************************************  Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  **********************************************************************  Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during  one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  *********************************************************************  Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and  current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for  contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have  been added to the library (scroll below).

ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is  providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be  grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of 12 new Transportable SATCOM Ground Terminals (TSGT), including 9 full terminals and 3 support rigs, and the upgrade of 7 Tri-band TSGTs in the NATO inventory. These projects are included in Project serial 2003/0CM03018-0 under CP 0A0149 for the procurement of SATCOM Communications System Capabilities, that include the procurement of 12 TSGTs and Project serial 2003/0CM03034-0 under CP 5A0030 for the upgrade of the 7 second generation TSGTs.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the Infrastructure Committee.  The rough cost estimate of the project is 22.85 million EUR ($27.5 million USD) for the procurement of 12 TSGTs and 3.54 million EUR ($4.3 million USD) for the upgrade of the 7 TSGTs. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) is IFB-CO-11790-TSGT. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Both projects are expected to be completed in 18 months from the Effective Date of Contract (EDC). The Invitation for Bids (IFB) will be structured in 2 portions reflecting the procurement of new TSGTs and the upgrade of the NATO-owned tri-band TSGTs. The Bidders will be allowed to choose whether to bid for only one or for both portions. The two portions will be evaluated and awarded separately.

The competitive bidding is limited to companies experienced with the provision of similar types of systems; in addition, the bidders will be required to submit with their bid a Certificate of Conformity (COC) in accordance with STANAG 4107 for the qualified Terminal (TSGT) that they will propose for the new TSGT project. 

The envisaged method of bidding for both portions will be the One Envelope Procedure in which the Price Proposals are opened and evaluated and the bids ranked in order by lowest price. Technical Evaluation then commences with the lowest price bid until a fully compliant bid is found.

ELIGIBILITY

Interested firms must be nominated by their National Authorities with the required Declaration of Eligibility. REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED.

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a Bid Guarantee of 200,000 EUR for the first portion (procurement of TSGTs) and 100,000 EUR for the second portion (upgrade). Should the selection and award procedure exceed the 12 month after Bid Closing Date, firms will be requested to voluntarily extend the validity of their bids and Bid Guarantee accordingly. Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.

National authorities are advised that the ICB package, including technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents are NATO UNCLASSIFIED. If classified material will have to be included in the ICB package or in the Bidders response to the IFB, the transmission of it shall be processed through their respective National Delegation/Mission to NATO.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Embassy in Brussels to submit a Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) on your behalf: 1 November 2005.

2. Anticipated date that the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB/IFB) will be forwarded to those on the Bidder List (distribution of the Cahier des Charges): End of December 2005

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: April 2006 (at least 84 days after issue of IFB)

4. Anticipated contract award date: September 2006

CERTIFICATION

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DOES NOT SERVE AS THE CONTRACTING AGENCY FOR NATO PROJECTS. HOWEVER, ALL FIRMS WHOSE FACILITY IS LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO QUALIFY TO BID FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. 

The contracting entity is the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A). Only firms that the U.S. Department of Commerce has certified as eligible will be allowed to bid. A Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) will be submitted on their behalf to the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, which will in turn provide the Declaration of Eligibility to the contracting entity.

Question 1:  There is a contradiction between the original description provided in the solicitation and the drawing provided in the above referenced Amendment.  The original description called for "Duplex" switch.  A duplex switch uses two key-interlocked switch and only one (1) set of fuses.  The drawing provided shows two individual, key-interlocked, fused switches.  Which one is required?  Answer:  Mechanical key interlocks are to prevent from having both switches closed and to prevent opening fuse compartments ( 2 each ) while anyone of switches are closed.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   Amendment #4 Technical Questions Question #1:  There is no listing anywhere about requirements on size of samples to be measured or footprint size of scan range? Answer: The EPA did not specify, but the EPA estimates 150 to 200 mm in diameter sample size to be  acceptable as a max. Question #2:  There are no definitions about resolution of imaging required or noise levels of the system.  Answer: Section 2.0 subtask #6 did not specify the definitions about resolution of imaging required , but the EPA requires a resolution of 1-2 um, with minimal noise  levels.  The EPA identified  the need to have a vibration table to reduce noise associated with room vibrations, in the specs.  (See 2.0 subtask 6 is revised as follows: Capable of providing a vibration control table, with a resolution of 1-2um, with minimal noise levels.  (This is a necessary  feature for this purchase order, as the EPA facility is known to have vibration issues)    Question #3:  It looks like the bid can be submitted by fax.  Is this correct?     Answer:  Yes, it states in the RFQ fax submissions are acceptable. (email is the preferred method) Question #4:   What is  your definition of stick-slip imaging?  Answer:  The EPA requires a tapping mode feature and wants to avoid stick-slip imaging.  The EPA want to operate in a mode that minimizes stick-slip motion. The due date of quotes reamains unchanged, quotes due November 07, 2005, 3:00PM (EST) Amendment  #3 Technical Questions Question #1:   The "shear force, stick-slip motion" is one type of measurement, while "tapping mode" and "sample compression" are another type.  Are both types required or only one or the other? Answer:  The option to perform both types is requested as stated in the specs,  "Capable of providing shear force, sample compression, and stick-slip motion for high resolution, true surface measurements (e.g. tapping mode AFM operation or operation mode with like capabilities). As a reminder the last day for technical questions is Wednesday, November 02, 2005  Amendment  #2 Technical Questions Question #1:  What are the specifications concerning the surface potential measurement requirement? Answer:  The EPA's  interests lie in the need to determine the surface charge of surfaces and see how the charge varies across a surface.  The surface charge of a corroding  metal, for example, is controlled by surface functional groups on the corrosion deposits that form and understanding how the charge changes across a surface might indicate differences in chemical composition.  The surface charge also plays an important role in controlling the tendency of the  surface to adsorb ions, and the attraction of colloids and attachment of bacteria to the surface.  Experiments designed to see how water chemistry changes the surface charge of metal surfaces, for example and other materials are planned.   Amendment #1 Technical Questions Could the EPA clarify  this portion of the Specifications:  "Capable of meeting the following specifications: electric field microscopy, life-mode capabilities (i.e. magnetic interactions versus topography). Capable of providing preferred simultaneous display of topography image and cantilever oscillation." Question #1:   Does the use of an inexpensive oscilloscope meet the requirements of "display", as compared to an alterative of generating stored data, an acquisition of an image or map? Answer:  It might be best to use an example of an application:  The EPA looks at metal corrosion products frequently and is  interested to know whether certain areas of the corrosion deposits are magnetic and/or electrically conductive, as well as possessing  the need to obtain topography information.   For this requirement the EPA may also be interested to know whether the materials are reactive with certain other  materials or chemical functional groups.  Question #2:  Oscillating cantilever may destroy a tip. Is the requirement to have an oscillating cantilever? Answer: The EPA would like to possess the ability to use appropriate modified tips to answer the questions of reactivity.   It is the EPA's  understanding that the simultaneous display of topographic and cantilever oscillation images will permit a qualitative comparison to be made between the material properties of samples.  Basically, the EPA is looking for the capability of measuring both height and amplitude for a comparison of the  area between the two images.   The Last day for Technical Questions is Thursday November 02, 2005.   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The NAICS code is 334513.  The specifications for the Atomic Force Microscope are as follows: 1.0	Atomic Force Microscope Specifications and Requirements The atomic force microscope  must be capable of providing the following features to meet the required needs of the EPA's experimental research projects: "	Capable of providing the following scanning capabilities: electric force microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, conductive atomic force microscopy, surface potential  microscopy. "	Capable of providing shear force, sample compression, and stick-slip motion for high resolution, true surface measurements (e.g. tapping mode AFM operation or operation mode with like capabilities). "	Capable of performing AFM imaging in a closed fluid cell. (This is a key and  necessary feature that will allow evaluation of surfaces while in an aqueous environment). "	Capable of  providing active, real-time scan linearization "	Capable of providing multiple pass topography scanning, which allows for direct separation of topographic data from amplitude, phase, or  frequency detection data. "	Capable of providing a vibration control table. (This is a necessary feature for this purchase order, as the EPA facility is known to have vibration issues).  "	Capable of providing enhanced sensitivity capabilities, i.e. ability to provide surface information at  nanoscale accuracy.  "	Capable of providing rapid scan time.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, Mission to the West Bank and Gaza (USAID/WBG) is seeking proposals from American and Local construction contractors to construct small-to medium-scale local water and sanitation facilities in the West Bank and Gaza. 
 
It is USAID/WBG’s intents to award multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for these efforts within specific geographic areas of the West Bank and Gaza, with each contract being active for a one and a half year period. Upon award, each of the IDIQ holders will be allowed to bid on specific construction projects. Each task order issued will contain a pertinent work description that includes a complete set of Bill of Quantities, Technical Specifications, and Drawings. The scope of these IDIQ contracts may include the installation of sanitary sewer, the rehabilitation of existing potable water wells, repair and or replacement of well pumps and motors, rehabilitation and/or construction of water booster stations or sewer pump stations, site civil works, electrical control panel fabrication and installation, site electrification, water and sanitation pipeline installation, water reservoir construction and other general civil, mechanical, and electrical works.  
 
Although this is open to U.S. Firms, current travel restrictions prohibit entry into Gaza by contractors' expatriate personnel who are U.S. citizens, U.S.-Palestinian dual citizens or third country nationals. U.S. Firms are reminded of the restriction imposed by AIDAR 725.703(b), which requires at least 50% of the supervisory and key personnel working at the project site to be citizens or legal residents of the United States. No Exceptions will be authorized. The selected contractors must be able to mobilize quickly and must have similar construction experience and demonstrated capability of managing multiple activities of similar projects in the West Bank or Gaza. 
 
The solicitation and RFP for services indicated will be available after 18 November, 2005.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Area Attack Systems Group, AAC/AASG, intends to solicit and award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Ellwood National Forge Company, Irvine, PA to produce up to 30 BLU-121/B warhead cases from Eglin Steel (ES-1).  This requirement can only be met by Ellwood National Forge Company because they are the only producer of ES-1 steel that consistently meets the Government’s requirements and that can machine the BLU-121/B bomb case in accordance with the applicable drawing.  The Contractor will qualify the steel material for each warhead case by conducting a suite of mechanical property tests on heat-treated specimens obtained from the case material and providing the results to the Government.  If multiple cases come from a single ingot, all cases from that ingot can be qualified from a single suite of mechanical property specimens.

The test specimens should be prepared as follows:  heat-treat a minimum of one qualification sample from each forged ingot.  These samples will be heat-treated in the same furnace that is used to heat-treat the warhead.  Two pieces of steel, each approximating the mass of a BLU-121/B warhead, should be heat-treated along with the qualification samples to simulate a typical heat-treat load.  The Contractor will test three tensile and six Charpy impact specimens from each ingot and provide the results to AAC/AASG.  

The Government reserves the right to conduct its own suite of property tests to validate samples taken.

The required properties to be obtained from the specimen tests are listed below.  The “Single Test Minimum” refers to the minimum properties for any single test specimen.  The “Average” refers to the minimum average of at least three test specimens from any single qualification sample.

Qualification Test Properties:  Single Test Minimum/Average (of at least 3) - - Ultimate Tensile Strength:  min Yu = 240 ksi/avg Yu = 244ksi;  Static Yield Strength: min Ys = 188 ksi/avg Ys = 192 ksi; % Strain to Failure: min Sf  = 12.0%/avg Sf  = 13.0%; Charpy Impact (at -40ºF): min CI = 16 ft-lbs/avg CI = 19 ft-lbs. 

The AF Contracting Officer, or her representative, will notify the contractor of any  ingot or bomb case failing to meet minimum properties and unacceptable under this contract.   

The contractor shall measure the mass and center of gravity of each warhead in both unassembled and fully-assembled states and deliver the resulting data.  Weight limits should fall within the acceptable CG limits of a MK-84.  Cases are to be delivered to the government NLT 15 July 2006.

The technical data package is undergoing revisions and is not available at this time.  The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement.  The AAC Ombudsman is Col Susan Mashiko, AAC/DC(S), 101 West “D” Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL  32542, (850) 882-0662, susan.mashiko@eglin.af.mil.

Contract  writting system problems prevented loading a complete RFP document. A word  version of the Draft RFP FA8626-05-R-2077 has been loaded to the PIXs  library below.

Questions on the draft RFP for Virtual  Industry Day should be e-mailed to the buyer, Theresa hay, at  Theresa.hay@wpafb.af.mil with a copy to the Program manager, Vince Lewis  at Vincent.lewis@wpafb.af.mil . Detailed questions on format and minor  issues are not the purpose of the VID. Questions that address omissions  and significant issues or areas of confusion are desired. XR-SIMAF Library  The XR-SIMAF Library is not available until 19 Oct 05 between the hours of  0900 and 1500 EST. Library appointments must be made thru the SIMAF POC,  Ms. Stiles at 937-904-7205, Margaret.stiles@wpafb.af.mil **************************************************************************** Update 4 October 2005 - Virtual Industry Day for draft RFP (imminent  release) and Buyer Name Update The XR-SIMAF draft RFP is planned for  release by 11 October 2005.

Look for further information on this site for further  information regarding this Virtual Industry Day. Note: New buyer Theresa  Hay replaces Michelle Hendricks on all future correspondence. ************************************************************************ Update 30 Sep 2005 - Re-Send to Fed Biz Opps - Organizational Conflict of  Interest The Fed Business Opportunities site can not handle the  Description in excess of 24000 characters so the original Sources Sought  announcement of 17 May has been saved as a WORD file and loaded to the  XR-SIMAF PIXS library below as  "ORIGINAL_SOURCES_SOUGHT_ANNOUNCEMENT_17MAY05". NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during  one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and  current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for  contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have  been added to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions  received during Industry Day and anticipate posting answers by 6 July  2005.  ************************************************************* Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14  Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS library. ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun  05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the  submittal of the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday  June 17th will be extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions  were asked about the SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following  infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple  Functions QUESTION: Because the standard business practices, company past  performance and responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR  requirements/restrictions will be the same for all functional areas, would  it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a cover letter with separate  attachments; one containing the common company data and then attachments  that address each functional area separately? ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is  providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be  grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package. Common  or repeated information may be referred to from another function area SOC,  however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will  be acceptable, however. Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one  page cover page that may contain business information and details like  business size and CAGE code, etc. The cover page does not count towards  the 5 pages per function. Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be  acceptable to submit the SOC via email? ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is  acceptable. Please allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low  band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC submittals to Patricia  Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO will confirm receipt  of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14  June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to industry via  PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings  will be loaded to PIXS and will available for download by COB 15 Jun 05.  ******************************************************************************Update: Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 Thefollowing sentences have been modified in the following synopsis toreflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

<DESC>***  Correction of announcements previously issued on 10/27/05 & 10/31/05. *** The National Park Service will issue a Prospectus for a Concession Contract for merchandise, food and beverage services within Bandelier National Monument on November 4, 2005.  The National Park Service will conduct a tour of the concession facilities at Bandelier National Monument on November 9, 2005. The tour will begin at 10:00 A.M. in the Administration Lobby, at Monument Headquarters located in Frijoles Canyon. Interested parties must R.S.V.P. by November 4, 2005.  The Concession is located near the NPS visitor center in Frijoles Canyon and is traditionally open year-round except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years days.  The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR Part 51, has determined that the existing Concessioner is not a preferred Offeror for this contract.  One contract will be issued for the above listed services.  The length of the new contract will be ten (10) years.  Any offer, including that of the existing Concessioner, must be received by the Acting Chief, Concessions Management, National Park Service, Intermountain Region, 12795 W. Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, CO 80228 no later than seventy-five (75) days after the release of the prospectus in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract to provide these services within Bandelier National Monument. The Prospectus will be issued November 4, 2005, for a 75-day response period under the terms described in the Prospectus, with proposals due on January 17, 2006, no later than 4:00 p.m.  There is a printing cost recovery charge of $35 per copy to be delivered via Federal Express or $30 per copy if picked up in person.  Checks or money orders (no cash accepted) must be payable to the National Park Service and you must include a business address (no post office box) to receive a Federal Express package.  Prospectus packages are available by contacting Tom Williamson, Acting Chief, Concessions Management, National Park Service, Intermountain Regional Office, 12795 W.

<DESC>The Advanced Tactical Aircraft Protection (PMA272) Program Office of the Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters anticipates a new start program for a Directed Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM) system for Strike Fighters. The Strike DIRCM system (Missile Detection integrated with a DIRCM capability) will provide tactical aircraft self-protection against IR guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and air-to-air missiles (AAM). The Strike DIRCM acquisition program will begin at Milestone B as the start of the System Development & Demonstration phase (SDD). The Program Office is currently planning for a Milestone approval to take place at the end of FY06 commencing with contract award within the 1st Quarter of FY07. 

The Missile Warning System (MWS) detects the threat and cues the DIRCM to the threat location. The Strike DIRCM then slews its jammer to the threat direction, establishes a track, and creates an optical break lock (jam) using modulated IR radiation generated from a laser.  The Strike DIRCM system is envisioned to be wing-mounted pod containing the Missile Warning System (MWS), and the DIRCM to provide a standalone Infrared (IR) self-protection capability on all Navy Strike fighter aircraft. The system should also be designed to be compatible with other Department of Defense (DoD) strike-fighter aircraft. The Strike program is structured to achieve full operational capability utilizing an evolutionary acquisition approach.  The evolutions are as follows:
 
·	Block 1	Strike DIRCM integrated into an autonomous pod 
·	Block 2	Enhanced Aircraft integration with displays and other equipment for coordinated responses 
·	Block 3	Geo-Location capability 
·	Block 4	MWS integration internal to host aircraft

Industry is invited to express their interest in the planned SDD contract for Block 1.  Please submit expressions of interest to: Naval Air Systems Command, Attn:  Ms. Amy Timmermann, 301-757-7063, 47123 Buse Road, Bldg. 2272, Suite 453, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547.     The preferred method of submission is via email to: amy.timmermann@navy.mil.  An alternate point of contact is Mr. Dan Gentry, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 757-7069, e-mail:  william.gentry@navy.mil.   Please submit your expression of interest by 15 December 2005.
     Industry is alerted that NAVAIR anticipates posting Strike DIRCM SDD documentation (Draft Specification, Draft Statement of Work, etc.) for industry comment on the NAVAIR Home Page on or about 22 November 2005.  The NAVAIR Homepage is located at http://www.navair.navy.mil/ and can be accessed using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer.  To access the information, click on Doing Business and then click on Open Solicitations.  The Strike DIRCM SDD information will be clearly labeled.
     NAVAIR anticipates posting a draft solicitation for the SDD requirements in late January 2006.  Potential offerors will be invited to submit comments.  An industry day may be held in the middle of February 2006.  NAVAIR anticipates releasing the formal RFP in late April 2006.  Contract award is anticipated in the middle of December 2006.
      This sources sought synopsis does not constitute a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or make a contract award under the Strike DIRCM program.  In addition, the Government will not reimburse any funds expended by interested parties in response to this sources sought synopsis.

With over 25 years of progressive and outstanding experience in contract/proposal development and management, Conner Consulting & Resources, LLC (CCR) is considered an expert in the field.  CCR’s progressive experience dealing with hundreds of public sector and private agencies including various agencies within Department of Health and Human Services make them uniquely qualified to perform work with little or no interruption in services and at a reduced cost.  CCR’s unique qualifications include working extensively with the DHHS/PSC/SAS/DAM staff over the past several years; assisting numerous operating divisions/program offices in the development of acquisition plans, statements of work, solicitations and contracts.  CCR has provided expert advice and assistance in: performing all cradle-to-grave functions of the acquisition process including: documentation to support acquisitions, assisting and training staff in the use of numerous software packages, and various other functions required to augment current staff levels.  CCR has performed extensive closeout activities in the past 2 years.  Because of their considerable experience within the DHHS/PSC/SAS/DAM, using the FAR, HHSAR, and other Agency guidance, CCR alone has the unique qualifications and expertise that would allow the project to be completed in a timely fashion and with minimal interruption and cost.  Therefore, the government believes that to award this contract to any other vendor but Conner Consulting & Resources, LLC would result in significant delays and significant increase in cost.  The purpose of this synopsis, however, is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above. Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as described above by 2:00 pm EST, November 15, 2005.  No solicitation document is available at this time.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Contractors may forward capability statements to the referenced address by November 15, 2005. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Zycus Model Maintenance
<DESC>This serves as a “Notice of Intent” to award a sole source delivery order open market to Zycus, to provide Model Maintenance software license for the General Services Administration Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) for FSS Programs.  GSA/FAS OCIO plans to negotiate with Zycus to purchase this Model Maintenance software license as a commercial item.  General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) operates GSA Advantage, Virtual IT Market Place (VITM), Air Force Advantage, Veterans Affairs (VA) Advantage, and the Department of Agriculture USDA Advantage applications, critical to the operation of the GSA Schedules program.  Included within these web-based systems is the ability to assign over 10 million products, a UNSPSC® code.  The United Nations Standard Products and Services Code® provides an open, global multi-sector standard for efficient, accurate classification of products and services.  These codes are then used to sort and present, accurate results to customers when searching for products and services.  The original Zycus software license, which currently supports this cataloging capability was purchased in September, 2003 off GSA Schedule.  This purchase was conducted in direct response to a GAO report, which cited the need to improve the catalogue capability.  Since implementation, a need has arisen for an additional Zycus model maintenance software license.  This proprietary software license will allow GSA to continue its on-going product and service classifications, and improve the accuracy of displaying the correct search results to customers.  The use of UNSPSC® will also provide a rich data set for GSA initiatives such as Strategic Sourcing and Spend Analysis.  The increase in Sales for GSA Advantage from FY04 to FY05 was significant.  Implementing categorization for GSA Advantage! played the largest part in this increase as customers are finding the products they need much faster.    Continued increase in usage is anticipated, and the model management software will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the current operation.  The proprietary Zycus model maintenance software license is not currently available on GSA Schedule.  Therefore, it shall be purchased from the open market from Zycus.  It is not possible to solicit offers from numerous potential sources because the Zycus software is proprietary and can be obtained from only one vendor.  Because the office of the Chief Information Officer has already determined that Zycus meets current operating needs, there is no requirement to incur additional costs (such as procurement, installation, programming, test, and deployment costs) to convert to a new environment.

<SUBJECT>A -- Cargo Advanced Automated Radiography System (CAARS)
<DESC>1.  In the fall of 2005, DHS intends to issue an RFP for the development and production of a Cargo Advanced Automated Radiography System (CAARS) focused on the automated detection of shielded special-nuclear-material (SNM) as well as unshielded SNM; automatic detection of other contraband such as high explosives and drugs is desired.  The operational requirement for CAARS mandates that it be able to scan and process the data for a 40 foot container in under 15 seconds.  CAARS may include but is not limited to high and dual energy x-rays, gamma rays, neutrons and other transmission methods; and all image reconstruction approaches will be considered.  System characteristics must include automated image processing and alarm generation, and advanced human factors facilitating the human interface.  DHS intends to begin production and deployment of these systems in FY08.  As such, proposed technology solutions must have a 2-3 year development, test and evaluation horizon.

2.  In preparation for the development of the CAARS Performance Specification and RFP, DHS intends to conduct a CAARS Industry day to better understand current system performance and manufacturing capabilities; and the status of ongoing research and development efforts.  The Industry Day will be held on 12 and 13 July 2005 at DHS facilities in Washington DC.   Each participant (from industry, national laboratories, academia and other interested parties) will be encouraged to provide a half-hour briefing to DHS.  Each briefing will be held in private.  That is, no participant will see or hear another participant’s briefing.  

3.  Participation and Submission.  DHS requests that those interested in participating in the CAARS Industry Day submit an e-mail notification to Mark.Rampey@associates.dhs.gov by 17 June 2005 with a point of contact, phone number and e-mail address.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-6. The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity, GovWorks, is issuing this solicitation Number 0406RQ60170 on behalf of Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration. This contract will procure technical, administrative, translation and interpretation support the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, DOT. Consistent with the NAFTA?s commitment to eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade and our overall efforts to facilitate implementation of the NAFTA truck and bus access provisions, the FMCSA is focused on implementing procedures that allow both U.S. and Mexican carriers to obtain IRP and IFTA credentials and allow the carriers to use the highways of each NAFTA country on an equal basis. This effort provides the southern Border States the technical and administrative assistance they need to effectively implement procedures to issue credentials to Mexican carriers as the NAFTA access provisions are implemented and the carriers begin to operate beyond the border commercial zones. Concurrently, the work encompassed within the contract will allow the States to continue to work towards a long-term solution that permits Mexico to become a member jurisdiction of IRP and IFTA and register Mexican motor carriers under the terms of the agreements and will provide the FMCSA and the States the opportunity to work towards a reciprocity arrangement with Mexico for U.S. carriers that will operate in Mexico. The resultant contract is anticipated to be Time-and-Material Contract Type. NAICS CODE: 541614 PRODUCT CODE: R406 COMPETITION: Full and Open Competition; Unrestricted.

STATEMENT OF WORK: MEDICAL EXAMINER PERFORMANCE STUDY I. Overview The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) was established as a separate administration within the U.S. Department of Transportation on January 1, 2000, pursuant to the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. The Agency?s primary mission is to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving large trucks and buses. This multi-method research project, examining medical examiner performance, will impact the Agency?s regulatory guidance and policy governing the physical qualifications of commercial motor vehicle (CMV) operators, and will complement the curriculum development and testing activities in the proposed National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners (refer to http://www.nrcme.fmcsa.dot.gov/). II. Background The Agency estimates that there are approximately 10 to 11 million drivers subject to the FMCSA?s medical standards and advisory criteria. A medical certificate is typically valid for 2 years after the date of examination, so it is estimated that a minimum of 3-4 million medical examinations are conducted year. Medical examinations may be performed more frequently if deemed necessary by the medical examiner or required for the CMV driver who holds a Federal medical exemption, intrastate medical exemption or other special status. The United States Congress, National Transportation Safety Board and many other prominent organizations have expressed significant interest in improving the quality of the interstate CMV driver physical qualification examination. There has been no research to date that directly examines the role and performance of medical examiners who determine the physical qualifications of CMV drivers in the United States. Medical examiners are the medical and osteopathic doctors, physician assistants, chiropractors and advance practice nurses who perform these driver examinations. The relevant FMCSRs and Medical Conference Reports are available on-line via http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rulesregs/fmcsr/medical.htm . III. Statement of Work The project goals are to improve scientific guidance on medical examiner performance issues that impact interstate CMV operator health and safety, and to inform associated Agency policies and programs. Specific objectives are now described. The contractor shall: 1. Evaluate medical examiner performance and outcomes associated with the physical qualification examination for commercial motor vehicle (CMV) operators; 2. Compare medical examiner methods and outcomes by profession (medical doctor, osteopath, chiropractor, physician assistant and advance practiced nurse); 3. Provide data (practice, profession) regarding medical examiner delegates (e.g., nurse aide, medical assistant); and 4. Recommend improvements in the physical examination process for CMV operators. The contractor shall conduct multi-method study conducted on-site in different, common settings where commercial motor vehicle driver physical examinations are performed. Using simple survey, participant observer and other relevant research methodologies, medical examiners will be directly interviewed and observed before, during and after the CMV operator physical examination process. The research design will focus on key elements of the performance of the physical qualifications examination, based on data-driven clinical decision-making models that address reliability and validity and feasibility. Partners will include medical and relevant health provider associations, occupational health providers and motor carriers. Study sites (locations of on-site observation) will be determined by FMCSA based on relevance to interstate CMV operator health and safety, geographic and socioeconomic diversity and other relevant factors. FMCSA has relationships with organizations that will grant access to researchers who conduct this study (e.g., Concentra Health Care and other occupational medicine clinics, J.B. Hunt, Schneider) although the contractor may offer site location recommendations. IV. Task Description FMCSA will provide data to the contractor and any additional relevant information that may become available. The contractor may access large truck and bus safety and other relevant information found in the Commercial Driver License Information System (CDLIS) and other FMCSA databases (refer to http://ai.fmcsa.dot.gov/mcspa.asp). The contractor shall perform in accordance with the statement of work. The contractor shall provide the personnel, equipment, materials and facilities to respond to various support required to complete each task order. There are four tasks for the contractor to perform. These tasks are: Task 1. Perform written or oral survey of medical examiners, focusing on essential elements of the physical examination and discovery of problems associated with the examination process. The survey can be a significant representative sample of the different practitioner types assessing knowledge of key elements required for CMV driver certification to operate in interstate commerce (e.g., sociodemographic, key health indicators ad medical condition information such as health history); Task 2. Conduct participant observer study (and relevant study method(s)), gathering data regarding medical examiner practice (including outcome and practice data by examiner profession). The contractor will observer FMCSA medical examiners on site (e.g., trucking companies, private occupational medicine practice); Task 3. Analyze general data regarding medical examiner practice in the United States, using relevant transportation safety, census and health data sources (to provide an update of CMV driver health and safety); and Task 4. Provide briefing(s) with final report (and database), including recommendations for process and policy improvements regarding the physical examination process for CMV drivers who operate in interstate commerce. V. Deliverables (D) The contractor shall be responsible for these meetings and reports: A. Start-up meeting: Within 30 days of contract award, the contractor shall meet with the COTR and other interested FMCSA personnel, to address any administrative matters and to refine (as needed) the contractor?s technical approach to fulfilling the task order requirements.

Such laborers and mechanics shall be paid not less than the appropriate wage rate and fringe benefits in the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed, without regard to skill, except as provided in the clause entitled Apprentices and Trainees. Laborers or mechanics performing work in more than one classification may be compensated at the rate specified for each classification for the time actually worked therein; provided, That the employer’s payroll records accurately set forth the time spent in each classification in which work is performed.

(b)(1) The Contracting Officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics which is not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the contract shall be classified in conformance with the wage determination. The Contracting Officer shall approve an additional classification and wage rate and fringe benefits therefor only when all the following criteria have been met: 
(i) The work to be performed by the classification requested is not performed by a classification in the wage determination. 
(ii) The classification is utilized in the area by the construction industry. 
(iii) The proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe benefits, bears a reasonable relationship to the wage rates contained in the wage determination. 
(2) If the Contractor and the laborers and mechanics to be employed in the classification (if known), or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer agree on the classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), a report of the action taken shall be sent by the Contracting Officer to the Administrator of the: 
Wage and Hour Division
Employment Standards Administration
U.S. Department of Labor
Washington, DC 20210 
The Administrator or an authorized representative will approve, modify, or disapprove every additional classification action within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary. 
(3) In the event the Contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the classification, or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer do not agree on the proposed classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), the Contracting Officer shall refer the questions, including the views of all interested parties and the recommendation of the Contracting Officer, to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for determination. The Administrator, or an authorized representative, will issue a determination within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary. 
(4) The wage rate (including fringe benefits, where appropriate) determined pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause shall be paid to all workers performing work in the classification under this contract from the first day on which work is performed in the classification. 
(c) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly rate, the Contractor shall either pay the benefit as stated in the wage determination or shall pay another bona fide fringe benefit or an hourly cash equivalent thereof. 
(d) If the Contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, the Contractor may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing bona fide fringe benefits under a plan or program; provided, That the Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the Contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the Contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.

<DESC>It is the Navy Exchange Service Command's (NEXCOM's) intention to award license agreements to firm(s) to renovate and operate food concessions in accordance with this contract at the locations described below.  These locations are currently operated by Eurest Dining Services and will transition to the successful offerors upon award of agreements awarded based on this solicitation.  NEXCOM prefers to award one license agreement for all four  locations but reserves the right to make multiple awards if in the best interest of the Navy Exchange.

S. national branded burger concept be operated in place of the Burger King concession operated by Eurest in the air terminal.

NAS Sigonella, Main Exchange Food Court - NEXCOM prefers U. S. national brand chicken and Mexican concepts, preferably Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell concepts. 

Estimated annual sales for each location is as follows:  
Capodichino-$450,000; 
Navy Lodge TGI Friday's - $1,700,000; 
Sigonella Burger King - $700,000; and,

8. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below 
I.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

This position is located in the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of the Assistant Secretary (INL/FO).  The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and on international criminal justice issues for the Department of State.

The incumbent of this position serves as the Program Director of USG’s police advisory program in Haiti, and as a senior advisor to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Latin America Programs on issues relating to the policies and programs for improving the security situation in Haiti.  The Program Director/senior advisor will be physically located in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  While in Haiti, the incumbent works directly with the Ambassador, advising him/her on the full range of issues for which he/she is responsible.

The situation in Haiti changed dramatically in February 2004 with growing levels of violence leading to the departure of the Haitian President and a change in the Haitian government.  While the US and others provided a near-term military presence, the United Nations committed to the long-term deployment of a military and police stabilization force to assist Haiti’s reestablishment of security throughout the country.  The need to establish security, in an environment of continuing violence and domestic turbulence, became and remains the dominant US and UN policy goal in Haiti.  Hence, the priority of Haitian National Police (HNP) support programs will remain crucial to the success of US policy goals to and beyond national elections scheduled for October and November 2005.

Prominent among the early actions taken by the US to restart HNP support programs was the establishment in May 2004 of a Police Advisory Group (PAG) within the Embassy, Port-au-Prince.  The PAG is the principal organization for developing, implementing and overseeing US bilateral police support programs designed to address the principal, near-term U.S. policy goal – improving the security situation.  The Program Director is responsible for supervising this group, consisting of up to six contract criminal justice experts.  The Police Advisory Group is the primary U.S. interlocutor with the Director General of the HNP and the UN Civilian Police Commissioner. The Program Director provides USG oversight of US CIVPOL seconded to the UN CIVPOL Mission.

Major Duties and Responsibilities

The Program Director has primary responsibility for providing senior-level advice and assistance to the DAS for Latin America Programs and the U.S. Ambassador to Haiti in the formulation and implementation of policies for an effective police support program, including staff supervision and oversight of INL-funds dedicated to the program ($9.5M in FY-04; $14.3M in FY-05).  The incumbent also serves as the Narcotics/Crime Advisor to the Chief of Mission, in the absence of a permanently assigned NAS, as well as providing regional law enforcement expertise to the U.S. Embassy in the Dominican Republic.

The incumbent:

•	Serves as the senior security issues and law enforcement policy expert and advisor to the DAS for Latin America Programs, and to the Chief of Mission and Deputy Chief of Mission in Haiti, the non-resident Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) and other principal Country Team members.  

•	Provides policy analysis and guidance to the Ambassador, senior policy specialists in INL and regional bureaus on the most effective means to promote security and police reform in Haiti.  Such guidance is considered authoritative and may address any of a wide number of issues, such as legislative authority, technical merit or political priority of particular activities, potential conflicts with other USG programs, interagency coordination or coordination with other governments.

•	Participates in senior level meetings to develop plans/programs for implementation of police programs and integration with UN programs, and represents the USG in coordinating US HNP support programs with the General Officer commanding the UN military mission (Brazil), and with the UN police (CIVPOL) commissioner (Canada).

•	In the absence of a permanently assigned NAS, serves as Narcotics/Crime Advisor to the COM, providing counterdrug policy and program assistance to the country team, the Haitian Government and the HNP; and provides regional law enforcement expertise to U.S. Embassy, Santo Domingo.  Provides current analysis and up-to-date information on narcotics/crime issues and assists in determining where these issues fit on the bilateral priority list and where/when they need to be discussed in bilateral and/or multilateral fora.  Acts as a catalyst and conduit for information exchanges on global drug control issues, and on strategic efforts in the areas of law enforcement and judicial and criminal justice system reform.   

•	Monitors and interprets region-wide narcotics/crime trends, policy decisions and developments, and makes recommendations to the DAS for Latin America Programs and other senior INL managers which form the basis for potential agreements between the U.S. and Haiti/Dominican Republic on narcotics/crime related activities.

•	Supervises and coordinates the Police Advisory Group (PAG), senior contract police advisors to the HNP Director General and the Haitian corrections system, as well as FSN employees directly supporting the PAG, and those contract or other experts temporarily in Haiti for training and/or HNP assessment purposes.  

•	Acts with broad authority in ensuring that the plans, decisions, priorities and commitments of the INL senior management team are understood and implemented.  Attends meetings on behalf of the Assistant Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretary, representing their points of view on critical program/policy issues.  Serves as the primary point of contact for the INL Bureau with the COM and DCM, and the Haitian Government, the UN and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) on the full range of substantive issues in improving the security situation in Haiti. 

•	Plans, coordinates and executes a significant, multi-year HNP assistance effort ($24 M for FYs 04 and 05) to include significant expansion of the size of the HNP, basic and in-service training programs, infrastructure improvements, and vehicle and equipment procurement components; provides professional advice and assistance in the development and acquisition of weapons, ammunition and non-lethal law enforcement equipment for the HNP. Based on extensive internal and external research, determines best procurement strategy, ensuring that the Bureau’s funds dedicated to these projects are managed in the most efficient and effective manner. 

•	Recommends to the Assistant Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretaries resource allocations to fulfill policy priorities related to narcotics and crime control programs in Haiti, and to maximize efficient and effective use of resources.  Participates with other senior staff in the development of annual strategy reports, and the design and implementation of program evaluation. 

•	Responsible for vetting and shaping requests by the Government of Haiti for purchasing weapons from the U.S. This is a very controversial and delicate area as Haiti is subject to a U.S. weapons embargo, and these purchases require a waiver of the embargo and Congressional approval.  Ensures that COM, DCM and senior INL managers are kept apprised of the status of such requests, and regularly briefs Congressional staffs, providing expert commentary on law enforcement weapons and non-lethal equipment requirements and utilization.

•	Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the HNP in Haiti, with special emphasis on HNP development and protection of human rights; the performance of the U.S. CIVPOL contingent assigned to the UN in Haiti; and activities and unique policy matters related to law enforcement development and security issues in Haiti.

•	Represents INL in meetings with senior OAS officials to evaluate police recruiting policies and vetting procedures; makes recommendations to INL, the COM and DCM, and/or other international representatives as necessary with respect to changing existing or implementing new procedures to improve the overall effectiveness of the program.

•	Prepares succinct analyses of fast breaking events in Haiti with respect to counterdrug and anticrime activities for review by COM and DAS.  In addition, prepares longer range, analytical studies, which attempt to identify gaps in existing policy as well as emerging problem areas requiring high level attention.

•	Prepares, or directs the preparation of, background materials and reports used by the Assistant Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretaries in preparing speeches, briefings, and testimony to articulate U.S. foreign policy in counternarcotics and anticrime programs in Haiti.

•	Based on incumbent’s network of contacts throughout the Department bureaucracy, in other agencies within the law enforcement and foreign affairs communities, among Congressional staffs, and with interested NGOs, he/she provides an independent analysis of and advice on on-going and prospective policy issues related to specific areas of responsibility to COM and senior INL management.

<DESC>OPM-Federal Investative Services Division (FISD) has a requirement for the following investigative interview training. Interested contractors that are familiar with Federal background investigative procedures and invited to submitt responses to the Request for Quotations.  This is considered a commerical requirment under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR)Part 12.  All certifacations and representations that apply to FAR part 12 (52.212-1 througn 52.212-5) shall be submitted with contractor responses. All clauses and required submissions that apply to FAR Part 12 can be found and printed by visiting www.arnet.gov. 
   
A.  BACKGROUND 
The OPM Federal Investigative Services Division (FISD) provides Federal agencies with background investigative services to evaluate an individual’s eligibility for employment with access to classified information, assignment to or retention in positions with sensitive duties, or other designated duties requiring such investigations.  Approximately 6,000 civil service and contractor FISD investigators throughout the country conduct personal interviews with millions of subjects, subject-provided references, and developed sources from employers, educational institutions, residences, government agencies, and other sources.  Investigators must thoroughly review subject case information and be persistent in seeking details, examples, and justification for comments made by the subject and references throughout the course of these investigations.  All investigations must be compliant with FISD policies and procedures.  The information obtained during these background investigations form the basis for an agency's decision to accept or reject candidates for employment.  

The OPM training model consists of four phases.  These phases consist of a variety of learning experiences including distance learning, shadowing, classroom training, On-The- Job training, and advanced training.  The Agent will progress through these phases over the course of one year.  The two phases in which FISD desires to incorporate interview training are as follows:

•	Pre-Academy Training – During this phase, the new Agent will gain an understanding of the basic skills, regulations and policies used by Agents when conducting investigations.  The Agent must complete necessary Units within the Pre-Academy Training program as well as shadow his/her mentor during live investigations.  During this phase of training, FISD would like to insert a training product on interviewing that is consistent with the training FISD employees will receive during the BAT phase.  This material should introduce the general concepts and methods that will provided during Basic Agent Training (BAT). 

•	Basic Agent Training (BAT) – This phase will consist of Instructor Led Training (ILT) as well as challenging investigation simulations.  The Instructor Led Training portion of BAT will provide a brief overview of Units covered during the Pre-Academy training and in-depth training of topics not yet covered.  The simulations will challenge Agents by placing them in advanced live scenarios.  Throughout BAT the Agent will be tested through numerous comprehensive examinations.  During this phase of training FISD desires an interviewing class, that covers basic and advanced techniques.  

B.  PURPOSE
Through this solicitation, FISD is seeking experts in the field of investigative interviewing and behavioral assessment to conduct specialized training for its investigative personnel.  The training curriculum shall provide basic and advanced methods to help investigators:
•	conduct more productive interviews to maximize the collection of information, 
•	recognize verbal and non-verbal body language that may reveal possible deception, and 
•	employ questioning techniques to elicit additional, adverse, or contradictory information.

These approaches should help investigators strengthen their communication skills with interviewees, which in turn, could improve their ability to detect issues relating to the subject’s loyalty to the United States, criminal conduct, dishonesty, foreign associations, and employment, financial, educational, or behavioral problems.  The additional information gathered during the background interviewing process will help to ensure that informed judgments are made about the veracity of individuals subject to investigation for employment with the Federal government.  All interviewing techniques must be fully compliant with FISD policies and procedures to include FOI/PA regulations.  

C.  MAJOR TASKS AND DELIVERABLES 
Training will provide attendees with comprehensive knowledge of interviewing and elicitation techniques for conducting personal background interviews and collecting pertinent testimony relating to subject cases.  Curriculum shall consist of an interactive training product and a course to include instructional presentation with computer slideshows, audience participation, and practical exercises to create a productive learning environment.  Course can consist of a 1or 2-day period of classroom training as recommended by contractor and approved by OPM officials.  Course will supplement existing OPM investigator training, and be tailored to the special standards and requirements outlined in the OPM Investigator’s Handbook, OPM-FISD Security Manual, and applicable OPM contracts and directives.  Specific tasks are described below.

Task 1 – Course Planning 
a.	Conduct an initial teleconference with OPM officials to discuss existing and desired interviewing skills of investigators and how course will fulfill objectives of this RFQ.  
b.	Provide copies of course syllabus, training manual, training video, instructional media, interactive exercises, and pertinent reference materials for advance review by OPM officials no later than two weeks prior to the first training class.  
Task 2 – Interactive Training Product and or Pre-Course materials 
Develop and distribute OPM-approved training video or distance learning component of no longer than eight training hours for viewing by attendees two weeks before the date of the first training class.  Materials will highlight key concepts that instructor will present in class, to include discussion on methods of strategic interviewing, detecting deception, and non-coercive questioning and elicitation.  Contractor will produce a pre-coursework product training product that is custom-designed for OPM investigators, or use an existing proprietary pre course work material that must address these key concepts.  

Task 3 – Classroom Instruction 
Contractor will conduct a course on effective interviewing and behavioral assessment methods in relating to subjects and their personal and professional references.   Instructional delivery, practical exercises, and materials relevant to OPM background investigations will be custom-designed for OPM attendees.   Instruction will encourage active participation of course attendees, and emphasize the following skill-sets to help investigators maximize information collection, improve question formulation, and probe into sensitive issues in a non-confrontational manner.

1.	Structured Interviewing:  Instruction should focus on efficient methods of collecting relevant information during personal interviews to ensure successful communication and make accurate security determinations.  Topics should include interview preparation, asking pertinent questions, and recording case notes in reports that are informative yet brief as possible.  

2.	Detecting Deception:   Instructor will identify active listening skills that can help investigators recognize dishonest behavior that requires further questioning.  Session should help investigators become aware of verbal and nonverbal cues that could reveal deceptive testimony during face-to-face interviews, and how to address or refer possible security issues disclosed during the interview session.   

3.	Non-Coercive Elicitation:  Instruction will focus on techniques used to elicit information and clarify vague or contradictory responses.  Investigators should formulate questions that are relevant to OPM security issues (i.e., alcohol/drug use, financial irresponsibility, criminal or immoral conduct, dishonesty,  employment misconduct, use of firearms, emotional and behavioral instability, loyalty issues, etc.) and interact with subjects and their references in a non-threatening manner. 

4.	Practice and Demonstration:  As time permits, attendees should be given practical exercises to use the skills observed from the video and classroom to build competency in each skill set.   Instructor will provide opportunities to observe experienced interviewers, participate in classroom instruction, and get coaching from instructors.  If there is insufficient time to complete in-class exercises, instructor will provide follow-up exercises to OPM officials that they can use in future training programs.
