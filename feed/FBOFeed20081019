<DESC>This announcement replaces previous announcement 08-R-0001 for A-E Services which was in error.  The qualification statements received in response to announcement R-08-0001 will be considered by the evaluation board for corrected announcement MCCHAE-08-R-0001 as received unless revised or withdrawn by the firms providing those qualification files.  Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services Contract:  The Air Force intends to award two (2) IDIQ contracts for Multi Disciplinary Architect-Engineering Services for Commercial, Industrial, and Residential type design activities at McChord AFB, Washington.  The closing date for the receipt of responses is 2:00 PM local time (PST) on November 30, 2007.  The Multi-discipline A-E design services for McChord AFB, Washington are to be procured in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36.  The Multi Disciplinary A-E Services shall include the primary capabilities for Architectural, Civil, Structural, Electrical, Mechanical, and Environmental (including performance of Hazardous Material Surveys) and including ?Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design? (LEED) Professional Accreditation in support of Air Force Sustainable Design and Development Policy.  A-E Services shall include fact-finding, site surveys, investigations, and economic analysis in support of project design requirements; the production of design documents in support of executing construction projects.  The IDIQ contract will have a maximum monetary limit of $750,000 per year/period, with a minimum delivery order guarantee of $5,000 for the first task order during the first year.  The contract award and starting date will be approximately May 15, 2008 for a period not to exceed 12-months with four option periods not to exceed 12-months each which may be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  Work will be issued by means of a negotiated firm fixed-priced task orders.  An option period may be exercised when the contract amount for the base period or subsequent option periods has been exhausted or nearly exhausted.  The contract rates for the basic period shall begin on the date of the contract award and shall continue for 365 calendar days.  Typical investigative and design services shall be performed to support new construction; additions to existing facilities; remodel/renovation of existing facilities; alteration and repair of miscellaneous base wide infrastructure utilities and services such as water, sewer, electrical, communications, steam lines, fuel storage and transportation systems, airfield pavement projects, and integration of energy monitoring and control systems.  A-E will be required to perform various technical analyses in support of design addressing energy conservation, hazardous material remediation, compliance with Washington State historical guidelines and various State and Federal environmental controls.  The design of the fire alarm and suppression systems shall be performed by ?National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies? certified engineer.  The following factors will be evaluated as the basis for selection for award of a contract.  The following are the Primary Criteria used in the evaluation, each being of equal value: (a) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (b) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services including (LEED) certification; and (c) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recycled/recovered materials.  The Secondary Criteria are; (a) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project with a declining point value given the farther a firm is located from McChord AFB and (b) the Volume of work DOD previously awarded to the firm within the last 12 months with the object of effecting equitable distribution of DOD A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.  The Secondary Criteria are of lesser importance and evaluation point value than the Primary Criteria.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541310.  For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $4.5 million or less.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 19.7 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan or that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov/.  Interested firms possessing the capabilities to perform this work shall submit three (3) copies of the Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications for the prime firm and all consultants to arrive at 62nd CONS/LGCA, PO Box 4178, 100 Col Joe Jackson Blvd, Suite 2001, McChord AFB, WA 98438-0178 no later than the response date indicated above.  The Government will not entertain personal visits for the purpose of discussing potential.  Submittals by facsimile transmission will not be accepted and will be considered non-responsive.  No additional project information will be given to A-E firms.

<DESC>This announcement replaces previous announcement 08-R-0001 for A-E Services which was in error.  The qualification statements received in response to announcement R-08-0001 will be considered by the evaluation board for corrected announcement MCCHAE-08-R-0001 as received unless revised or withdrawn by the firms providing those qualification files.  Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services Contract:  The Air Force intends to award two (2) IDIQ contracts for Multi Disciplinary Architect-Engineering Services for Commercial, Industrial, and Residential type design activities at McChord AFB, Washington.  The closing date for the receipt of responses is 2:00 PM local time (PST) on November 30, 2007.  The Multi-discipline A-E design services for McChord AFB, Washington are to be procured in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36.  The Multi Disciplinary A-E Services shall include the primary capabilities for Architectural, Civil, Structural, Electrical, Mechanical, and Environmental (including performance of Hazardous Material Surveys) and including ?Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design? (LEED) Professional Accreditation in support of Air Force Sustainable Design and Development Policy.  A-E Services shall include fact-finding, site surveys, investigations, and economic analysis in support of project design requirements; the production of design documents in support of executing construction projects.  The IDIQ contract will have a maximum monetary limit of $750,000 per year/period, with a minimum delivery order guarantee of $5,000 for the first task order during the first year.  The contract award and starting date will be approximately May 15, 2008 for a period not to exceed 12-months with four option periods not to exceed 12-months each which may be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  Work will be issued by means of a negotiated firm fixed-priced task orders.  An option period may be exercised when the contract amount for the base period or subsequent option periods has been exhausted or nearly exhausted.  The contract rates for the basic period shall begin on the date of the contract award and shall continue for 365 calendar days.  Typical investigative and design services shall be performed to support new construction; additions to existing facilities; remodel/renovation of existing facilities; alteration and repair of miscellaneous base wide infrastructure utilities and services such as water, sewer, electrical, communications, steam lines, fuel storage and transportation systems, airfield pavement projects, and integration of energy monitoring and control systems.  A-E will be required to perform various technical analyses in support of design addressing energy conservation, hazardous material remediation, compliance with Washington State historical guidelines and various State and Federal environmental controls.  The design of the fire alarm and suppression systems shall be performed by ?National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies? certified engineer.  The following factors will be evaluated as the basis for selection for award of a contract.  The following are the Primary Criteria used in the evaluation, each being of equal value: (a) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (b) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services including (LEED) certification; and (c) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recycled/recovered materials.  The Secondary Criteria are; (a) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project with a declining point value given the farther a firm is located from McChord AFB and (b) the Volume of work DOD previously awarded to the firm within the last 12 months with the object of effecting equitable distribution of DOD A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.  The Secondary Criteria are of lesser importance and evaluation point value than the Primary Criteria.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541310.  For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $4.5 million or less.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 19.7 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan or that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov/.  Interested firms possessing the capabilities to perform this work shall submit three (3) copies of the Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications for the prime firm and all consultants to arrive at 62nd CONS/LGCA, PO Box 4178, 100 Col Joe Jackson Blvd, Suite 2001, McChord AFB, WA 98438-0178 no later than the response date indicated above.  The Government will not entertain personal visits for the purpose of discussing potential.  Submittals by facsimile transmission will not be accepted and will be considered non-responsive.  No additional project information will be given to A-E firms.
