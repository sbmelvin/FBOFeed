<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding five separate one year cost reimbursement contracts with each contract having four option years.   The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is interested in highly experienced organizations for the five regional Centers for the Application for Prevention Technologies or CAPTs.  The CAPTs are SAMHSA/CSAP’s primary knowledge application and capacity expansion program supporting CSAP’s mission to bring effective substance abuse prevention to every community. As such, the CAPTs form the cornerstone of CSAP’s efforts to move science into services. Under the guidance of CSAP, the CAPTs work to expand the capacity of the substance abuse prevention field through the application of effective evidence/science-based programs, practices, and policies within every State prevention service system and community. To accomplish this, the CAPTs provide their clients with timely and effective technical assistance, training, dissemination, and communication services that increase the transfer and application of substance abuse prevention knowledge and skills.

The overall CAPT program goals are to:
1) Serve as one of SAMHSA/CSAP’s major resource for expanding capacity, increasing effectiveness, and strengthening the performance accountability of substance abuse prevention services at both the State and community levels. 2) Disseminate effective evidence/science-based substance abuse prevention programs, practices, and policies so that they can be applied successfully within the diverse contexts of life within U.S. communities, States, Tribes, and other US Jurisdictions. 3) Provide effective technical assistance and training that expand the capacity of States and communities to implement effective substance abuse prevention services.  Such training and technical assistance is coordinated with the ongoing work of SAMHSA’s other dissemination efforts.

Furthermore the CAPT’s are to:
1. Provide state of the art substance abuse prevention training and technical assistance to States to build infrastructure and community capacity to adapt and implement effective substance abuse prevention programs.
2. Provide services in accord with the program policies of SAMHSA/CSAP.
3.  Inform the Project Officers of any publication based on the contract project. Additionally, the offeror must also ensure consistency with relevant CSAP and SAMHSA editorial guidelines and policies (e.g., use of logos, text, format, and related production qualities) before disseminating any CAPT product. It must also comply with Title IV, Sec. 711 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that applies when developing promotional public service announcements.
4. The CAPTs have collaborated to establish a cross-CAPT evaluation plan assuring comparability of data and reporting. There are five Web-enabled databases: Event, Systemic Outcomes, Technical Assistance (TA), Products, and Success Stories. Each CAPT is expected to help shape and maintain these databases. The databases are accessed via the national CAPTUS website.
5. Provide information needed by SAMHSA to comply with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) reporting requirements. GPRA mandates accountability and performance-based management by Federal agencies, focusing on results or outcomes in evaluating the effectiveness of Federal activities and on measuring progress toward achieving national goals and objectives.  The offerors must comply with GPRA data collection and reporting requirements. A description of the CAPTs’ evaluation procedures and measures (including those pending as GPRA and performance measures) will be presented in the RFP. The final CAPT GPRA and performance measures for the program have not yet been determined, and SAMHSA will be working with the offerors to finalize them and obtain necessary clearances once the contract awards have been made.
6.  Provide the following types of reports.
·	Quarterly progress reports
·	Annual progress and fiscal reports
·	Final summary report at the end of the third year cycle.
·	Periodic delivery of electronic copies of contact and service data to the contractor providing data coordination of the cross-CAPT databases.
Additional reports may be required on special projects and activities (e.g., collaborative services delivered with supplemental funding by another Federal agency partnering with SAMHSA in this program). 
7.The offeror must have existing knowledge and experience working with states to support capacity development activities.
8.The offeror must have a working knowledge of CSAP and SAMHSA policy and programmatic initiatives.
9. The offeror must be located within the region they would serve and have been providing technical assistance and training for a minimum of two years in order to show they have established relationships with States and communities.

The CAPT-National Prevention Network (NPN) regions are listed below with the States. 
	CENTRAL REGION: North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin Illinois, 
	Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Michigan, Red Lake Chippewa Band
	NORTHEAST REGION: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,

Request for Construction Documents Exhibit    _______________
Attachment    ___________________
Solicitation     GS-03P-04-DXC-0020

DOCUMENT SECURITY - NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS:

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1.	Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records or recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

	Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary.

(a)	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and   

(b)	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certifications.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and 

(c)	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, 

(d)	A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) though (c), above.

2.	Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/'or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3.	Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

4.	Written agreement of disposal.   For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning, or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to award a sole source modification on contract M67854-03-C-2005.  This requirement consists of AVENGER Fire Control Computers and the required installation kits and associated spares. The total requirement is anticipated to be for a quantity of 42 AFCC kits over three years.  It is anticipated that this requirement will be a firm fixed price (FFP) modification to contract M67854-03-C-2005 with Boeing Company, Huntsville, AL.  It is planned that U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) funds will be used for this action.  The AVENGER Fire Control Computer (AFCC) is essential and is a required part of the U.S. Marine Corps AVENGER Ground Based Air Defense weapon system.  The AFCC is essential to the immediate modernization (enhancement capability and reliability) of the USMC AVENGER weapon system by addressing the most critical obsolescence issue by replacing the current AVENGER Control Electronics (ACE).  The AFCC interface with the Remote Terminal Unit accepts sensor track data from a tactical data link and once accepted, automatically slews the AVENGER turret in azimuth and elevation placing targets in the gunner’s field of view.   The resulting network permits rapid and accurate deployment of ordnance while maintaining a high degree of situational awareness for the gunner.  The AFCC, with the embedded Automatic Video Tracker (AVT), has been shown to be able to improve the overall capability of the AVENGER, either in a fixed position or on the move by allowing the AVENGER turret to automatically track a designated target.  The increased capability results in increased effectiveness against low-end cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as well as fixed and rotary wing targets.   This capability will significantly increase the effectiveness of currently deployed USMC air defense units in support of amphibious operations and continued operations ashore.   There is not an adequate technical data package (TDP) available for reference and information to support full and open or limited competition to manufacture the AFCC.  Boeing’s involvement in development of the AFCC, as well as procurement by the U.S. Army, has given them the knowledge and expertise to test the item for compliance with the performance requirements (this is base on past and current performance).  Boeing Company has developed the expertise to assemble the components.  Boeing will fabricate or purchase the required interface cables.  Boeing is the only company able to provide the total integration process in the timeframe required.  
This synopsis is for informational purposes only.  Any response to this announcement shall be made in writing and e-mailed or faxed to the contract specialist no later than 12 May 2004. No telephonic responses will be accepted. See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Raytheon Advanced Electromagnetics Technology Group, Rancho Cucamonga California. Specifically, the contractor will be responsible for providing the following spares to support the prototype Active Denial System (ADS) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) being deployed in support of the force protection needs of military forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom:

·	One (1) gyrotron millimeter-wave source tube;
·	One (1) flat parabolic surface (FLAPS) antenna assembly;
·	One (1) hybrid-electric HMMWV including Li-Ion battery packs; and,
·	One (1) vehicle set of system operator displays

The Active Denial System (ADS) is a non-lethal counter-personnel  directed energy weapon systen that uses millimeter wave energy to produce an intolerable, almost instantaneous heating sensation on human skin at distances well beyond small arms range, causing the adversary to flee.  The shallow penetration depth of this frequency and the low energy levels used preclude injury.  The ADS ACTD was awarded to Raytheon under contract F29601-98-9-0001.  This spares requirement builds on Raytheon’s on-going efforts.  

No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement, to include descriptive literature and pricing, within 30 days of this announcement to the contact person listed above (Peggy Smith at Smithp@jnlwd.usmc.mil).  This announcement is not a request for competitive proposals; however all proposals received by the date identified above will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22 (45 days reduced to 30 days)

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Contracting Office (NAVFACCO) Port Hueneme, CA 93043 intends to award on a Sole Source basis to University of Hawaii (UH) for Kaneohe as a follow-on effort to previously awarded purchase orders.  The University of Hawaii is the only responsible source because they completed test at MCAS Kaneohe Bay on an alternate vegetative cap where surface runoff and percolation from 2-ft thick caps have been compared for three treatments.  Over a four-year period data had been collected over various sampling showed that vegetative can be used to control infiltration of landfill.  However, the water balance calculation show discrepancy in the water mass in soil.  The old data relied on soil moisture probes (TDR type) and that was later discovered to be unsuitable for water balance.  This requirement will fund further work and additional data will be collected and along w/ old data will be used to refine the HELP (version 3) models for calculating runoff & leachate. UH is the only source with the background and knowledge of performing the requirement.  This is not a request for competitive proposal and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe it can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within15 from the publication of this synopsis.  A notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose to notify.  This procurement is being issued using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.

<RESPDATE>052804
<ARCHDATE>06272004
<CONTACT>Mark Ross 850-235-5624 , or Contracting Officer Margie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) to Magneto Inductive Systems Limited (MISL) USA of San Bernadino, CA on a sole source basis for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and production phases of the Magneto Inductive-Remote Activation Munitions System (MI-RAMS) program. The effort will include LRIP planning, long lead item procurement, and the manufacture, inspection, test and delivery of MI-RAMS kits. The government anticipates a period of performance for five years under an ID/IQ contract. The first year of the effort will involve LRIP planning such as long lead item identification for the production of the MI-RAMS system currently being developed under a sole source contract to MISL, Nova Scotia. The follow on years will involve procurement of long lead items and the manufacture of the MI-RAMS hardware. The MI-RAMS is a lightweight, compact, man-portable magneto inductive transmitter and receiver system to be used by Special Operation forces (SOF) and combat engineers.  MI-RAMS provides the capability to remotely control the detonation of demolition charges or to remotely operate other items of equipment such as beacons, laser markers, weapons, ground marking lights, etc. MI-RAMS will reliably propagate a signal through natural or manmade media such as water, earth or building structures. MI-RAMS will be compatible and functional with radio frequency (RF) RAMS (i.e. MI-RAMS and RF-RAMS will be able to be “daisy chained” as mission requirements, tactics and terrain dictate) providing the operator a synergistic increase in remote operation capabilities. RF-RAMS signals will propagate for a nominal range of 2 kilometers line o f sight, but the signals are subject to reflection, refraction, and scattering and therefore do not reliably operate in the mixed media environment (i.e. inside buildings, caves, subterranean structures, obstacles, underwater) in which MI-RAMS can reliably operate. The MI-RAMS will operate in all environments such as arctic, tropic, temperate, urban, beach zone and the surf zone (littoral) to depths less than 10 feet. The MI-RAMS system will include a shock tube initiation (STI) system to initiate shock tube when linked to the Type A electric output receiver. In order to simplify fielding and ensure all MI-RAMS, RF-RAMS and STI components are accessible to operators, it is anticipated the newly packaged MI-RAMS kits will include both MI transmitters and receivers as well as RF transmitters and receivers along with shock tube initiators. The new packaged MI-RAMS kits will  provide operators the complete remote initiation capabilities in one package along with several ordnance initiating capabilities using both MI and RF technology, i.e. electric initiation (Type A receivers), expendable non-electric initiation (Type B receivers) and reusable non-electric initiation (Shock Tube Initiators). The planned start date for this effort will be 3QFY04. The acquisition objective is for up to 5000 each MI and RF transmitters, 10,000 Auxiliary Power Packs, 25,000 each MI and RF Type A receivers, 50,000 Type B each MI and RF receivers and 15,000 Shock Tube Initiators. Detailed tasks will be provided, defining the required efforts, in individual delivery orders issued under the ID/IQ contract. This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), as applied in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii), i s deemed applicable as the agency’s minimum needs can only be satisfied by the unique supplies available from Magneto Inductive Systems Ltd, the only known supplier of magneto-inductive (MI) related technologies.  NSWC-PC has determined that MISL is only known supplier of MI related technologies that can meet the operational requirements of the MI-RAMS program.  This determination was based on the results of 29 market surveys conducted by CSS/ONR since 1993 that resulted in no responses other than MISL.  The MI-RAMS cannot be procured competitively utilizing a technical data package. Currently the patents and intellectual property rights to the relevant MI technologies belong solely either MISL or are Government patents licensed to MISL.  Additionally, per the approved MI-RAMS program Acquisition Plan, the LRIP and production quantities will be acquired from the system develop er. MISL is the sole developer of MI-RAMS.  NAICS Code 541710 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees (based on NAICS Code 334290). FSC is 5895.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Copies of the solicitation may be requested from the Peace Corps Point of Contact. The U.S. Peace Corps (PC) has a requirement to obtain a qualified independent, software development vendor to customize and implement an internet based application system that would allow users to fill out a Peace Corps Volunteer Application online and submit the information contained within the application electronically to the agency. The purpose of this online application system is to continue to fulfill the agency’s goal of providing Peace Corps applicants a high level of customer service and convenience, while also capturing and disseminating applicant data more efficiently and accurately. The Government will award a firm fixed- price Purchase Order (using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 13.5) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforming to this solicitation is the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors
considered. Although price is substantially less important than the technical factors combined, it will not be ignored. The degree of its importance will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be based, or when the price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technical superiority to the Government. Tentatively, this requirement will be awarded as a single, firm fixed-price contract with a period of performance of a one (1) year base period, and four (4) one-year option periods. Currently, over 70 percent of all Peace Corps applications (and
over 75% of all Health Status Review (HSR) forms, which is part of the application) are completed online, but separately. In 2003, these numbers amounted to 8,333 applications and 12,491 HSR’s that were completed through the use of the online application. In the past five years, the completion of Peace Corps applications online has become a major part of the Peace Corps business process. The contractor will ensure that there is no disruption in Peace Corps’ current ability to process online applications. The contractor shall survey and assess technology opportunities that will enhance Peace Corps application system performance and identify advance concepts that should be explored to meet emerging needs. While the Peace Corps will retain the use of its printed application for those applicants who do not have access to the internet, the agency seeks to continue the use of an online application form which provides the same functionality as the current application.  Peace Corps want to achieve the following goals: 1. Make the application process less expensive for the Peace Corps by saving time and the expense of printing and postage. Encourage more applicants to use the online application processes, by making it easier and more convenient than the paper process. 2. Further reduce the need for Peace Corps staff to manually enter the application data from paper applications. 3. Speed the receipt and dissemination of applicant information to Peace Corps headquarters and to Regional Recruiting Offices (RRO’s) across the country.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Email: mwebster@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Fernando Enrique Alvarez L., Gerente General, Empresa Nacional Portuaria, Apartado Postal No. 18, Puerto Cortés 1 Calle 1 Ave., Honduras, C.A., Phone:  011-504-665-0987, Fax:  011-504-665-1402, e-mail: falvarez@enp.hn.  Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to the Honduran Empresa Nacional Portuaria (ENP), in the modernization of operations and infrastructure.

The Port of Cortés is located on Honduras’ north coast with direct access to the Caribbean Sea.  The port is the largest in Honduras with five berths (handling dry bulk, containers, liquid bulk, passenger, conventional and refrigerated cargo, etc.) and is the primary port for trade bound for eastern U.S. and European markets from Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.  As trade with Central America continues to grow (U.S. exports to Central America are greater than that with Russia, India and Indonesia combined), the Port of Cortés will require improvements and modernization to keep pace with the demand for efficient, safe and secure maritime trade.  

At present, the port is run by the Empresa Nacional Portuaria (ENP), however, the future of the port operations are bound for private concession.  The Presidential Commission for Modernization of the State (CPME) is preparing laws and regulations, with assistance from the World Bank, to reform the government’s involvement in the economy and to privatize many state run enterprises such as the port sector.  In sum, the Port of Cortés is one of the key focal points for national development and work is in place to modernize both operations and infrastructure.

In light of the pending privatization of the port operations, the technical assistance has focused on areas which are crucial to the success of the port, regardless of the schedule (estimated at 1-5 years) and process of privatization (the ENP is responsible for the oversight of all national ports).  The areas to be aided include: Information Technology, Maintenance and Repairs, Service Boats, Fire Protection and Cargo Handling Improvements.  Improvements in each of these areas will elevate the potential for successful adoption of, and compliance with, new U.S. Department of Homeland Security and International Maritime Organization measures mandating greater safety, security and tracking operations at ports worldwide.  Given the current pressures/obstacles facing the ENP, the timing of this technical assistance is crucial for success.  Honduras, and those depending on the port as a key trade corridor, will be greatly impacted by the technical assistance. 

This project has the Government of Honduras’s highest priority, and it is supported by the U.S. Embassy in Honduras, as well as the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. U.S. Government support rests in part on the idea that the establishment of a well-functioning and secure port will promote more secure and efficient trade between the U.S. and those Central American countries dependent upon the port for their shipping needs, but, more importantly, the successful implementation of a market-oriented energy sector in Honduras will go a long way toward regional integration and will be compatible with the Central American Free Trade Agreement now under discussion.

The general objective of this Technical Assistance is to support the ENP in the development of a comprehensive plan for modernizing the infrastructure and operations associated with safety and security needs at the Port of Cortés.  This Trade Capacity Building project is considered a top priority for Honduras and the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement negotiation process; it will strengthen the foundations of the key Caribbean port and trade corridor for trade from Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala bound for markets in the eastern United States and Europe.   

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following: 

Task 1: 	Review & Recommend Information Technology Systems 
Task 2: 	Evaluate Maintenance and Repair Procedures
Task 3: 	Evaluate & Recommend New Service Boats & Rehabilitation
Task 4: 	Evaluate & Recommend Fire Protection Systems
Task 5: 	Evaluate & Recommend Cargo Handling Improvements
Task 6: 	Prepare Interim and Final Reports and Presentations

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $525,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 12:00pm local Tegucigalpa, Honduras time, April 30, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY:  Sponsored by the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, Detachment 11, Defense Meteorlogical Satellite Program (DMSP), Peterson AFB, Colorado Springs, CO will host an Industry Day forum on the Mark IVB follow-on system sustainment acquisition.  This event is scheduled for Friday, 16 Apr 04 from 8:00 am to 11:00 am at the Aerospace Building in Dining Room A & B.  The address is:  2350 East El Segundo Blvd, 90245-4691.  The purpose of this Industry Day is to provide interested parties and potential offerors an opportunity to receive information on the Mark IVB system sustainment acquisition and provide feedback.  Specifically, the forum will focus on presenting the Air Force’s vision for the procurement.  The classification for the briefing is “UNCLASSIFIED.”  Attendance will be limited to five (5) personnel per company/team.  All notifications of attendance, list of names attending and phone numbers, and any questions regarding this announcement must be made, by e-mail, by Friday, 09 Apr 04 to Capt Richard A. Marsh at richard.marsh@cisf.af.mil.  A courtesy copy of the e-mail should also be sent to Capt Shawn S. Beauchamp shawn.beauchamp@cisf.af.mil.  The Mark IVB System is a meteorological data ingest, processing and dissemination system.  Meteorological data is obtained (i.e., ingested) from U.S. domestic (i.e., Department of Commerce) and foreign meteorological satellites, both polar orbiting and geostationary.  Once processed by the Mark IVB, this data is made available to analysts and forecasters located worldwide (i.e., not associated with the Mark IVB).  The Mark IVB systems are installed in six operational locations worldwide.  Operating sites are located at Hickam AFB, Hawaii, Kadena AB, Japan, Andersen AB, Guam, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, Lajes AB, Azores and Sembach AB, Germany.  While the Mark IVB was originally designed as a stand-alone, self-contained meteorological ingest and processing system, where analysis and forecasting was accomplished on site, it has evolved into a network-centric enterprise system where analysis and forecasting is accomplished off site.  As a key component of the Joint METSAT Imagery Software and Terminals (JMIST) system, the Mark IVB provides high-resolution METSAT data to authorized users worldwide on a near-real time, 24/7 basis.  These remote users employ one of two Mark IVB software applications (Generic Imagery Dissemination System and PC Forecaster) and network connections to access, download, display and manipulate the Mark IVB meteorological data.  The Mark IVB server software operates in a real time UNIX environment.  The maintainer and client software applications operate in the Windows XP environment.  The meteorological data is first ingested and processed by the RF segment of the Mark IVB, it is then sent to the data server where it is reformatted into a Mark IVB unique format and mounted on the data server for dissemination to authorized users.  The maintainer application contains a variety of system configuration, satellite ingest scheduling, maintenance and analytical tools.  A future upgrade to the system will replace the Unix server with a Windows server, making the entire Mark IVB Windows-based.  The Mark IVB automatically collects Geostationary and Polar meteorological data directly from satellites without reliance on other means of communications.  The data streams consist of visual and infrared imagery and mission sensor data.  The Mark IVB also has the capability to generate satellite pass schedules, error messages and log status and audit events.  The vast majority of the Mark IVB system is comprised of Commercial Off-the-Shelf hardware and government-owned software and must be continually upgraded to meet evolving mission requirements due to new satellite launches and forecasting techniques, and to avoid technical obsolescence.  The majority of the Mark IVB sustainment effort is software maintenance, with about a 90% – 10% split between software and hardware sustainment.  Interested parties, who believe they have the capability of performing as prime contractors in support of this effort, are invited to submit a statement of technical capabilities, which includes the following information:  Personnel/Size Standard - (1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact and telephone numbers, (2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other.  Experience – (1) Specific work previously performed or being performed relevant to the specific task areas of this effort.  Small Business companies with the capability to perform this requirement are encouraged to participate.  The small business size standard for this requirement is NAICS 541710.  Interested offerors must submit Statement of Capabilities (SOC), which clearly illustrate expertise in the following areas:  (1) Electromagnetic signal processing of the microwave spectra (L, S and X-Band), including Meteorological Satellite mission sensors (microwave and infrared), (2) Digital electronics, (3) Radio Frequency Interference, (4) Antenna and tracking system design including radio frequency link analysis, (5) Control systems, (6) Automated Data Processing Equipment, (7) System, hardware and software engineering, production, integration, installation and test, (8) Computer Network Technology and Operations, (9) Technical support (hardware and software), (10) Computer network security, including certification and accreditation and (11) Ability to begin the supportability analysis immediately after contract is awarded.  The SOC must also illustrate the offerors working familiarity with: (1) Satellite and Orbital physics and (2) Terrestrial weather forecasting.  E-mail your SOC statements to Capt Marsh no later than 14 May 04, which should be limited to twenty-five (25) pages excluding resumes.  If you are interested only in subcontracting opportunities, please indicate clearly in your submission.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Verbal responses will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>R -- Examination of Trends and Outlook for Steel Demand
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-TATD6000-04-90426
<RESPDATE>042604
<ARCHDATE>05112004
<CONTACT>Jean Greene, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-713-0838, Fax 301-713-0806, Email jean.greene@noaa.gov
<DESC>Congress has requested that the Department of Commerce conduct a study of the future demand for steel. This request stems from a concern for the future of the domestic steel making industry. One rationale for undertaking this project is the concern expressed by steel company and service center (distributor) executives to the Department of Commerce that their customer base, particularly in the manufacturing sector, is irreversibly shrinking. For example, these executives have indicated that steel consumers in the auto parts and castings sectors are relocating at an accelerating rate to low wage countries, particularly to other countries, where these products can be manufactured at lower cost. Press accounts suggest end users of these products in the United States are prodding their U.S. suppliers to move offshore to lower their costs.

With the trade deficit in goods rising from $436 billion in 2000 to $546 billion in 2003 (annualized), steelmakers are concerned that the trade balance in steel-containing goods is widening, with adverse impact on U.S. steel demand. 

The purpose of this study is to undertake a comprehensive examination of the long term demand for steel within the United States. The study will consider the expected demand for steel-using products and services (indirect steel imports), the impact of imports of steel-using products, and the substitution of alternative materials, and lighter weight steel by steel using industries. The study shall address the question of the extent to which the recent, 2002-2003 downturn in the demand for steel is result of short-term cyclical conditions and long-term trends.

The offeror shall undertake a quantitative analysis and make estimates of long-term demand for steel within the United States that are based on an analyses of the major steel-consuming industries and the demand for their outputs. This analysis shall at a minimum consider and quantify the factors affecting the demand for steel.

The Offeror shall estimate the extent to which the current decline in the demand for steel, 2001 to 2003, is the result of secular trends.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense. The rule authorizes contracting officers to r eject offers from contractors that have not registered. (The CCR web site may be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov). Small and small disadvantaged firms are encour aged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with small and small dis advantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.   If a large business firm is selected for award, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-1, regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to su bcontract.  Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract, the Corps of Engineers target goals for subcontracting are 57.2% to small business concerns; 10.0% to small disadvantaged business concerns; 10.0% to women-owned small business co ncerns; 3.0% for SBA HUBZone certified small business concerns; 4.0% veteran-owned small business concerns; and 3.0% to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.  Large firms should keep these target goals in mind when considering qualificati ons of potential subcontractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor socio-economic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications.  An approved small business subcontracting plan will be required prior to award to a large business  firm.  The NAICS code is 541360 with a small business size standard of $4,000,000.

In a letter dated June 10, 2003, SAMHSA promised to forward a copy of the RFP when it was published to all of the original CAPT cooperative agreement applicants.  However, due to an administrative oversight, this was not done in two regions.  Therefore, in order to be fair to all potential offerors, the due date for these two regions has been extended.

If you had submitted a proposal under either the Southeast or Southwest Region, you may choose to make no changes to your proposal, amend the proposal submitted, or collect your proposal and submit a new one.

If you have not received a copy of the solicitation, this may be obtained in any of three ways; by mail; picked up in person at 5515 Security Lane, Suite 640, Rockville, MD 20852; or, electronically at the SAMHSA web site: http:/samhsa.gov/contracts.  If you have a continuing interest in the RFP, notify the primary point of contact that you wish copies of amendments to the RFP (if any) to be sent to you, or check the Web Site regularly for amendments which will also be posted there.  Note: If you rely on the Web Site for obtaining amendments, SAMHSA has no way to assure, and therefore assumes no responsibility for assuring you have downloaded these amendments.  Requests for copies of the RFP must be made in writing.  Requests will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis until the supply is exhausted; however, there is no assurance that copies requested after August 20, 2003 will reach the requestor before the due date for receipt of responses. Requests shall be forwarded to the attention of Lynn Tantardini, Contract Specialist, Division of Contracts Management, OPS, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Rockwall II Building, Room 640, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857.

The contractor will be responsible for providing program management and for assuming a partnership role with the Government in providing technical solutions and in securing and retaining business.  Requirements are defined further in the contract Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Interested parties are encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page. This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) of 1997.  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of Best Value to the FAA.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519, Other Computer Related Services - $21/million will be used for this acquisition.  Interested vendors that have experience in IT Support Services are to submit a FAA Business Declaration form with their response to this announcement/SIR1.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement/SIR1. The FAA is committed to the socio-economic goals of the Department of Transportation and the Agency for Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman-owned, and Service-Disabled Veteran business arrangements.  Therefore, contractor demonstration of commitment to these goals enters into the FAAs selection of the submittal representing the overall best value for those services identified and enumerated in the PWS.  It is highly desirable that all offerors recognize and demonstrate their commitment to these goals through their respective subcontracting and/or teaming arrangement(s).  Close monitoring of the accomplishment of the goals will be an important post-award activity.  The vendor will be expected to make a good faith effort to achieve the following subcontracting goals: Percentage of Total Contract Value 			Teaming/Subcontracts to SB				26%* 			Teaming/Subcontracts to SDB				10% 			Teaming/Subcontracts to WOB				 5% 			Teaming/Subcontracts to SD/VOB			 1% 			*The 26% figure represents the entire small business subcontracting program goal. Subcontracting goals will be an evaluated factor in Phase 2 of the procurement process. This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  The initial phase involves the announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this SIR. Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendors eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendors eligibility pursuant to this SIR.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendors information.  Any statement included in a vendors response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  Documentation includes, but is not limited to, formal resumes, licenses, financial statements, work plans, etc.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2x11, printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendors response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility. SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendors submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendors eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR. (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable.) 	1.  Past Performance and Experience: (Note: Past performance represents how well an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has done it.  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the PWS.) 		(a) Vendor must have experience with IT and related support services as identified in the attached PWS.  Vendors shall provide a list of relevant past and present contracts performed for Federal, State, or Local Governments or commercial sources within the past five (5) years involving effort of same or similar complexity, magnitude, and level.  The vendors documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information stated below. 		(b) Vendors may select no more than three (3) relevant contracts for which to provide past and present contract performance information, which summarizes contractual efforts the vendor considers relevant to this acquisition.  The past and present contract performance information should demonstrate the vendors ability to perform the proposed effort.

<DESC>DESC: This is a complete text correction to Notice Dated 22 March 2004.  The Information Exploitation Systems (SRH) Program Office seeks to upgrade Eagle Vision through the addition of Cartosat (IRS P5) satellite capabilities using existing commercial-off-the-shelf products.  This is a request for information (RFI) only.  It is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), or Solicitation, or an indication that the government will contract for these items.  The government will not pay for information received in response to this RFI. Eagle Vision is a system that collects and processes data transmitted from commercial satellites including SPOT 2,4, &5, Ikonos,  Quickbird, Radarsat I, and IRS 1C&D.  Eagle Vision includes an antenna, a shelter and transit-cased processing equipment that collects and processes imagery into standard commercial formats.  An Indian satellite, Cartosat, will be launched within the next year to provide high resolution optical satellite imagery.  This RFI seeks information on COTS capability to order, downlink and process Cartosat (IRS P5) mission data to produce level 1 scenes in formats certified by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and Antrix.  All Cartosat, IRS P5, formats and imaging modes will be supported.  The upgrade will be compatible with the existing Eagle Vision ground station processing architecture and will be seamlessly integrated into the existing Eagle Vision systems.  Interested parties are invited to provide technical information, cost of capability, and describe customer base and experience providing such products.  Completion of all work is required no later than 12 months after award of contract.  The earliest anticipated award date is Jan 2005.  Please provide the name of your firm, address, point of contact, phone/fax, and an electronic mail address, if available.  This synopsis does not constitute a RFP or an Invitation for Bid (IFB) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for information solicited.  Interested parties should provide product information meeting the above stated requirements no later than 20 days from the date of this notice.  All responders are requested to indicate if they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern or woman-owned small business.  In addition, contractors will indicate whether or not their equipment and services are offered through the GSA schedule or any other government-wide agency contract. Contractors desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting (CCR) System.  The government may solicit firms meeting the screening criteria in this synopsis.

This procurement is for a firm to provide all management, labor, materials, and equipment necessary for the modernization of five passenger elevators as follows; modernize four gearless elevators (#1 thru #4); modernize one geared service elevator (#6). Elevator #5 shall not be modernized under the base contract, but if exercised under Option 1, shall be removed out of service. Alternate 1 will be identified to replace the cabs on elevators #1 thru #4. The modernization will require maintenance servicing for existing and renovated elevators and associated equipment from Notice to Proceed until all elevators are accepted for beneficial use. The work shall be conducted to accommodate continued occupancy of the building. The contractor’s personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project. This will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source selection procedures are identified in FAR Part 15.3, and will incorporate the tradeoff process identified in FAR 15.101-1. This method will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, including the past performance of their subcontractors, qualified/experienced personnel and on their price proposals. All proposals are required to address each of the qualifications. Omission of any of the criteria may render the proposal nonresponsive, preventing the opportunity to submit a price proposal and gain further consideration for award.  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors will be considered equal to cost. The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are as follows: 1) Past Performance and Experience on Similar Projects.  To be considered under Past Performance: elevator installer, elevator maintenance, elevator modernization experience, control systems manufacturer.  To be considered under Past Experience:  previous client assessment of offeror's performance, project completion on time and within budget, and tenant impact.  Regarding past performance offerors with no relevant performance history shall provide information, which helps to identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to the requirement as identified in the attached Statement of Work. Offerors should provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions. The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror's past performance. 2) Proposed Project Team, Key Subcontractors, and Key Personnel.  Approval of an elevator subcontractor, or elevator contractor, is required. To be considered, contractor shall have upgraded within the last eight years, three elevator systems that are comparable to those to be worked on for this project; i.e., electric elevators of three or more cars in one group that serve at least seven or more landings in an office/commercial type building.

ELECTRONIC RFP ANNOUNCEMENT - The Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking a contractor to provide technical information support resources for cancer preventive agent identification, development, and qualification for clinical trials.  The projects required to satisfy the RFP workscope shall provide the diverse and specialized technical support services and products needed for the preclinical and clinical development of the most promising cancer chemopreventive agents.  The contractor will be responsible for providing services that support the discovery and early development of new agents in chemoprevention through literature searching, class studies, and agent scoring. The preclinical and clinical drug testing is supported through a comprehensive system of documenting all test results and clinical activities related to the agent and agent combination through a computerized database.  The workscope of the RFP is divided into different task areas.  These task areas are fully integrated and cohesive. Offerors are required to respond to all task areas of the RFP as one package.  Comprehensive details of the information management system are expected to be provided by the offeror based on their knowledge of the disciplines required in the Statement of Work, as well as experience working in the multidisciplinary fields of chemoprevention.  However, the information management system must be compatible with and migrate to the existing DCP Enterprise System Knowledge base (DESK) requirements specified in the RFP.  The task areas of the statement of work include:1) Cancer Preventive Agent Identification and Documentation; 2) Cancer Preventive Agent Data and Report Analysis, Status  and Documentation; 3) Information Management System and 4) General Tasks.  The proposed acquisition is a re-competition of contract N02-CN-05008 awarded to CCS Associates, Inc.  Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made on the basis of cascading evaluation preference approach.  It is anticipated that one (1) level of effort, TERM type contract will be awarded and that the period of performance will consist of a base period of five (5) years plus two (2) option years for possible total of seven (7) contract years.  It is also anticipated that there will be options for additional hours for each contract year including option years six and seven.    The award will be made to an eligible business concern included in one of the following three (3) cascading preference tiers, provided that adequate competition is received and award can be made at fair market price (see definition at FAR Part 19).  Adequate competition is defined as the receipt of at least two (2) competitive proposals in a tier from companies that are determined to be qualified, technically acceptable, cost reasonable and responsible business concerns.  The cascading evaluation is to be applied in the following manner: First Tier Competition: This Tier is defined by competition among eligible  HUBZone small business concerns providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort.  In the event that adequate competition and fair market price requirements cannot be met under the First Tier Competition, and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then competition at this Tier will stop. The one qualified firm from the First Tier will compete in the Second Tier Competition. Second Tier Competition is defined as competition among eligible small business concerns providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort. If adequate competition and fair market price requirements are met under the Second Tier, competition at the Third Tier will not occur and award will be made at the Second Tier. In the event that adequate competition and fair market price requirements cannot be met under the Second Tier Competition, and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then competition at this Tier will stop. The one qualified firm from the Second Tier will compete in the Third Tier Competition. Third Tier Competition is defined as an unrestricted, full and open competition with selection of an awardee based upon a best value determination pursuant to FAR 15.3.

Firms responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested.  If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, firms should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements to demonstrate that small business prime contractors can maintain labor, technical, and management control of the project, meeting the “limitations on subcontracting” imposed on small business set-asides.  Taking into account the magnitude of the scope of this effort, firms also should address the capacity of their financial infrastructure to deliver contract performance.  

Although no geographic restriction is anticipated, if responding firms are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area, indicate how the firm would coordinate with the agency program office to provide support to multiple sites.

In addition, please provide a capability statement addressing your organization’s ability to perform as a prime contractor the work described below.
The mission of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is to bring effective substance abuse and mental health programs to every community.  SAMHSA carries out this mission by compiling prevention, treatment and rehabilitation knowledge, identifying and promoting science-based programs, and building capacity at the State and regional levels to infuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation knowledge and programs into every community in the United States.
The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment’s (CSAT) grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts are designed to develop knowledge on best practices in substance abuse treatment.  In 1999, CSAT implemented a systematic program to synthesize, publish, and disseminate this knowledge to the substance abuse (SA) treatment and related fields.  Additionally, the Knowledge Application Program (KAP) has been responsible for production of CSAT’s premiere publication series, Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs). The current KAP has also been charged with considering the most effective formats for presenting TIPs to each of its intended audiences, and determining whether the specialized knowledge contained in the TIPs is actually reaching and being adopted by those most in need of that knowledge.  
The current KAP contract has begun to address the need for Substance Abuse treatment knowledge to be synthesized and packaged in different ways depending on the target audience.  For example, new formats known as “collateral products” have been developed to supplement the standard TIP document in order to better meet the needs of some audiences. The existing KAP program was built on the following premises: 1) Treatment information needs to be presented to target audiences through a range of media and learning approaches including interactive workshops, Internet training courses and videos as well as the traditional training classes and written publications; and 2) To be most useful, information must be specifically tailored to the particular needs of specialized provider groups and must also be culturally relevant when appropriate.
The next generation of KAP must support the strong emphasis at SAMHSA on the Science to Services and Workforce Development initiatives. Successful implementation of the science to services cycle requires a strong monitoring and feedback component. Within the context of this requirement, offerors should demonstrate how they will promote SAMHSA's new focus on disseminating effective interventions rather than generating new ones, support performance monitoring systems, assess impact of fidelity vs. adaptation on outcomes of treatment provider use of both KAP and non-KAP products, and provide input to the scientific community regarding new research priorities and service gaps for the substance abuse treatment field. Offerors shall also discuss their vision for the role of KAP in building a national dissemination network that links together existing training and technical assistance programs, and how KAP can generally support communities and providers to identify, implement, and evaluate best practices.

The Offeror must provide the following Capabilities which is required for the proposed Tasks under this requirement:

1.	Demonstrate expert knowledge of all CSAT programs, products, and services.
2.	Demonstrate ability to successfully synthesize and coordinate multiple (i.e., six or more), major Federal Knowledge Application, Science-To-Service, and Substance Abuse Treatment Workforce initiatives (national Block Grant, discretionary grant, cooperative agreement programs, and other contracts) for the purpose of maximizing the utility of alternative resources, and assuring comprehensive delivery of program information without duplicity or interference with individual program autonomy.
3.	Provide a proven track record of organizational capability to quickly assemble groups of seminal experts on highly specialized clinical, administrative, and fiscal matters to analyze and resolve emerging issues without hesitation; and to evaluate and immediately revise products, programs, and services (and their approaches) for expanded and alternative uses in the substance abuse treatment field.
4.	Demonstrate experience managing a major national initiative and implementing complex guidance from Federal staff, with a minimum of clarification or performance editing required. 
5.	Demonstrate expertise with designing and implementing exemplary program activities that respond to the requirements of the Government Performance and Reporting Act.
6.	Provide documentation that proves leadership in designing web sites from scratch, redesigning web sites to more effectively address customer needs, and creatively and quickly designing new components/pages for existing web sites with only broad guidance. Web site experience must include long-term experience with coordinating all aspects of work with multiple levels and representatives of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
7.	Demonstrate expertise over time in converting lengthy and complex scientific documents and publications for virtual posting on multiple web sites on an urgent timeframe.
8.	Provide documentation that proves the capability to conduct national and regional needs assessments and marketing studies that result in precise recommendations for substance abuse treatment products and collateral products (e.g., alternatives to standard written reports such as training, videos, curricula, pocket guides, concise desk references, summaries, brochures) needed in the field. Offeror experience must include highly successful experience with establishing formal, ongoing processes (utilizing well-established existing contact networks) to receive and update feedback from all CSAT staff and customers (grantees, States, trade associations, etc.).
9.	Demonstrate success with developing substance abuse treatment “product lines” that very effectively communicate material requiring national dissemination.
10.	Demonstrate corporate capability to manage and produce the development of over one hundred products and up to thirty meetings/ activities simultaneously.
11.	Demonstrate expertise with the DHHS Publications Planning and Clearance Process, including strong capability to develop and assure successful processing of concept and content clearance packages.
12.	Demonstrate success in previously producing a premiere best-practices protocol publication series, including identifying and managing input from multiple, seminal experts in the field. 
13.	Demonstrate capability in producing accurate and complete annual market forecasting plans that precisely meet the program, product, and service needs of the substance abuse treatment field.
14.	Demonstrate expertise in adapting and translating products for new markets, including long-term experience in producing multi-language translations as well as products that precisely reflect necessary accommodations for the physically and mentally challenged.
15.	Demonstrated expertise in providing expert guidance to CSAT on the relevance and sensitivity of its products and services in addressing the substance abuse treatment needs of underserved populations in a culturally competent manner
16.	Demonstrate capability to very quickly assemble, manage and coordinate the efforts of very diverse and disparate working groups from the field. 
17.	Demonstrate capability to coordinate and produce up to 30 national conference workshops simultaneously.
18.	Demonstrate capability to coordinate and produce up to 18 national conference exhibits of KAP products simultaneously.
19.	Demonstrate capability to provide error-free, expert technical writing on virtually any aspect of the substance abuse treatment field.
20.	Demonstrate capability of existing staff to provide expert training and technical assistance to CSAT staff and very diverse customer groups in the field on knowledge application activities covered under the contract.

Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.  The intended contract shall provide the Government the option to extend the contract in one-year increments for a base and four option years.

After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time.  

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is interested in highly experienced organizations for the five regional Centers for the Application for Prevention Technologies or CAPTs.  The CAPTs are SAMHSA/CSAP’s primary knowledge application and capacity expansion program supporting CSAP’s mission to bring effective substance abuse prevention to every community. As such, the CAPTs form the cornerstone of CSAP’s efforts to move science into services. Under the guidance of CSAP, the CAPTs work to expand the capacity of the substance abuse prevention field through the application of effective evidence/science-based programs, practices, and policies within every State prevention service system and community. To accomplish this, the CAPTs provide their clients with timely and effective technical assistance, training, dissemination, and communication services that increase the transfer and application of substance abuse prevention knowledge and skills.

The overall CAPT program goals are to:

·	Serve as one of SAMHSA/CSAP’s major resource for expanding capacity, increasing effectiveness, and strengthening the performance accountability of substance abuse prevention services at both the State and community levels.
   
·	Disseminate effective evidence/science-based substance abuse prevention programs, practices, and policies so that they can be applied successfully within the diverse contexts of life within U.S. communities, States, Tribes, and other US Jurisdictions.

·	Provide effective technical assistance and training that expand the capacity of States and communities to implement effective substance abuse prevention services.  Such training and technical assistance is coordinated with the ongoing work of SAMHSA’s other dissemination efforts.

The incumbents on the CAPT’s cooperative agreements are the following: 1) Minnesota Institute of Public Health; 2) Education Development Center, Inc.: 3) Developing Resources for Education in America, Inc. (DREAM); 4) Southwest Prevention Center, University of Oklahoma; 5) University of Nevada, Reno; and 6) Arizona-Mexico Border Health Foundation. 

Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the following questions: 1) Does your firm qualify as a small or small disadvantaged business? 2) If disadvantaged specify under which disadvantaged group is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act?  3) Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? 4) Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? 5) Are you a certified Service–Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned? 

Furthermore, your responses should address your capabilities in the following areas;

1.	Most importantly, the CAPT’s are to provide state of the art substance abuse prevention training and technical assistance to States to build infrastructure and community capacity to adapt and implement effective substance abuse prevention programs.

2.	The CAPTs are expected provide services in accord with the program policies of SAMHSA/CSAP.

3.  The offeror must inform the Project Officers of any publication based on the contract project. Additionally, the offeror must also ensure consistency with relevant CSAP and SAMHSA editorial guidelines and policies (e.g., use of logos, text, format, and related production qualities) before disseminating any CAPT product. It must also comply with Title IV, Sec. 711 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that applies when developing promotional public service announcements.
	
4.	 The CAPTs have collaborated to establish a cross-CAPT evaluation plan assuring comparability of data and reporting. There are five Web-enabled databases: Event, Systemic Outcomes, Technical Assistance (TA), Products, and Success Stories. Each CAPT is expected to help shape and maintain these databases. The databases are accessed via the national CAPTUS website.

5.  Offerors must provide information needed by SAMHSA to comply with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) reporting requirements. GPRA mandates accountability and performance-based management by Federal agencies, focusing on results or outcomes in evaluating the effectiveness of Federal activities and on measuring progress toward achieving national goals and objectives.  The offerors must comply with GPRA data collection and reporting requirements. A description of the CAPTs’ evaluation procedures and measures (including those pending as GPRA and performance measures) will be presented in the RFP. The final CAPT GPRA and performance measures for the program have not yet been determined, and SAMHSA will be working with the offerors to finalize them and obtain necessary clearances once the contract awards have been made.
	
6.  The CAPT is expected to provide the following types of reports.
·	Quarterly progress reports
·	Annual progress and fiscal reports
·	Final summary report at the end of the third year cycle.
·	Periodic delivery of electronic copies of contact and service data to the contractor providing data coordination of the cross-CAPT databases.

Additional reports may be required on special projects and activities (e.g., collaborative services delivered with supplemental funding by another Federal agency partnering with SAMHSA in this program). 

7.	The offeror must have existing knowledge and experience working with states to support capacity development activities.

8.  The offeror must have a working knowledge of CSAP and SAMHSA policy and programmatic initiatives.

We are seeking contract mediators to ensure that the program has mediators available in each city where EEOC has a field office.  We are primarily interested in mediators on the west coast, southeast and southwest.  However, we are also considering national or regional contractors who can provide mediation services to several EEOC offices.  All mediators must meet the qualification standards described in Chapter 3 of the EEOC’s Management Directive (MD)-110.  Those qualifications are: (1) at least 20 hours of basic mediation skills training; (2) at least 3 co-mediations with a qualified mediator or five independent mediations and positive evaluations from a qualified trainer/evaluator; and (3) at least two verifiable references from two qualified mediators or trainer/evaluators.  Mediators must also possess knowledge of federal personnel procedures, policies and practices and the laws governing federal sector EEO.  For consideration in the selection process, please submit a brief capability statement.

<DESC>The US Air Force (USAF) is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to using magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) devices to find and identify targets of interest under tree canopy, camouflage and buried targets.  The USAF is also interested in COTS/GOTS technologies that are able to characterize these detected objects for the purpose of identification.  The technology, with minimal adaptation, must automatically detect targets of interest under tree canopy, under camouflage, and targets that are buried from an altitude of approximately 200-500 ft.  The technology should be able to find these targets of interest at an air speed of about 40-60 knots. This technology should be able to be integrated with a beyond line of sight communications (BLOS) package to pass results to a ground control station.  This information will be captured on a laptop where the target identification technology will be housed.  This identification technology will then identify these targets and display the results on the laptop.  Other requirements:  the magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) system must be able to fit on a small airframe.  The weight must be no larger than 20 lbs.  The maximum power consumption should be no greater than 90 watts.  The magnetic anomaly detection systems must be airworthy.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration.  The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding may be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Combat Command.

<CONTACT>Anthony Cicala, Contracting Officer, Phone (571)218-4639, Fax (XXX)XXX-XXX, Email acicala@darpa.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested sources by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) regarding the design, development, and testing of a new tactical ocean surveillance buoy capable of extracting energy from the local environment for station keeping and long-term persistence. 

The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other award instrument based on this notification, or otherwise pay for the information provided.  Respondents are notified that nothing herein obligates the government to issue any Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) or other such solicitation, although the Government may choose, at its sole discretion, to issue a solicitation during the third quarter of fiscal year 2004.

The information contained herein is for planning purposes only.  Any information submitted in response to this notice is strictly voluntary.  The results of responses received may help DARPA ATO determine if issuance of a future solicitation is appropriate and feasible.  At this point, DARPA ATO is contemplating one potential award for up to three years (base year plus options).  However, the program funding and the total program scope has not been finalized, and nothing herein obligates the Government to issue any future solicitation as a result of this action.  

Existing tactical systems (sonobuoys) are designed for relatively short durations and are susceptible to significant drift over their lifetime.  When drift is excessive, present procedures require new buoys to be deployed to maintain search pattern integrity.  Emerging concepts contemplate greatly extending buoy lifetimes and including Global Positioning System (GPS) for determining buoy location.  However, drift remains a problem.  GPS equipped long endurance buoys when combined with station-keeping and intra-sensor communications technologies, will enable the establishment of fields of long-term station-keeping ocean environment sensors that would sense and maintain their location.  Station-keeping technologies could provide the capability for rapidly emplacing a floating field of sensors to observe the undersea environment in an area, over an extended period of time without the need to lay or anchor such a field on the ocean floor.  A range of technologies can be considered to enable the station-keeping sensors and sensors fields, including many that rely upon local environmental effects (such as wind, solar energy, or temperature differentials) for their motive power.  

DARPA anticipates the following basic requirements for the station-keeping buoy:
	Buoy endurance: 4 weeks
	Station keeping watch circle: 250 m 
	Sea State: 4
	Size when stored: TBD (sonobuoy A-E)
	Sensor: acoustic hydrophones
Interested respondents are invited to submit to DARPA as early as possible, but not later than 12:00 NOON, Arlington, VA local time on 17 May 2004, a three page unclassified white paper summarizing their system concepts that employ long endurance station keeping buoys for persistence ocean surveillance and specific energy harvesting technologies for enabling station keeping.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate is also requested.  

A non-proprietary cover letter should be included with the white paper that provides the company?s Point of Contact (POC) name and contact information (including phone number and e-mail address), and states whether they are large, small, disadvantaged, and/or women-owned businesses.  

Responses should be submitted in a commonly used electronic format to K. Latt at POS@darpa.mil.  Responses that cannot be submitted electronically may be delivered to DARPA/ATO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington VA 22203-1714, Attn: K. Latt.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of the white paper via e-mail to the POC listed in the cover letter.

Responses should be marked with appropriate proprietary markings, as applicable, such as "Company Proprietary."  Markings such as "Company Confidential" or other phrases that may be confused with national security classifications shall be avoided. 

White papers will not be returned.

<CONTACT>MAGDA SZYMANSKI, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3066
<DESC>The U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC), Picatinny, NJ  07806-5000  seeks to acquire the services of a qualified vendor to provide system design, fabrication, installation, start-up, testing and operation of plasma arc  thermal treatment systems for the demilitarization of military ordnance. The  services are required in order to complete two on-going projects as well as fully execute one new project. The two on-going projects are the Plasma Ordnance Demilitarization System (PODS) being implemented at Hawthorne Army Depot, Hawthorne, NV and the Mobile Plasma Treatment System (MPTS) being implemented at Talon Manufacturing Company, Herndon, WV.  Both of these projects employ plasma arc furnace systems designed and fabricated by MSE- Technology Applications, Inc. of Butte, MT. The new project will be a transportable plasma furnace system that is integrated with a munitions pre- processing operation known as cryofracture.  Development of the integrated cryofracture portion of the combining system is the responsibility of others. The combined plasma arc/cryofracture demilitarization system will be  implemented at a DOD facility to be determined at a later date. This system is presently in the conceptual design stage. The PODS is a full scale plasma arc treatment system that includes a 400 cubic foot primary processing chamber, state-of-the-art pollution abatement system, feed system, water treatment system, PC based control system, and all ancillary support systems (deionize water, chiller, compressed air, etc.). The furnace operates in an oxygen- enriched environment and contains a 1MW universal plasma arc torch (i.e., can operate in both transferred/non-transferred mode) and 500kW non-transferred torch. The system has a 500 lb/hr nominal throughput of pyrotechnic ordnance,  which consists of high thermal output and high off gas output burning devices contained in metal, plastic, and cardboard casings. The system has been designed, fabricated, installed and partially tested at HWAD. Services would  be required starting in FY04 to complete start-up testing, train HWAD  personnel, conduct environmental compliance tests, obtain final environmental permits, update engineering and maintenance documentation, perform process  demonstration/validation/optimization tests, perform system maintenance as may be required, and transition the system to full-scale production operations.  The MPTS is a transportable plasma arc treatment system that includes a  primary processing chamber (furnace), state-of-the-art pollution abatement system, feed system, PC based control system, an air compressor, a 4160V  generator, a cooling system and a deionized water system. The furnace operates in an oxygen-deficient (reducing) environment and contains a 500kW non- transferred plasma arc torch. The system has a 300 lb/hr nominal throughput  for fuzes and fuze components, which is the feed material that will be  processed at the Talon site. The system is skid mounted and can be transported  on 9 flat bed trailers for set-up and operation. Services are required starting in FY04, at which time the system will have already been installed, started-up, tested, and will be ready for operation at Talon. Services are required to operate the MPTS for a period of not less than one year in order to complete the fuze demilitarization campaign, evaluate process performance, perform system maintenance, decommission and disassemble the system, load it onto flat bed trailers and transport it to a location to be designated. The combined plasma arc/cryofracture project is intended to provide complete demilitarization of high explosive-containing submunitions downloaded from Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs) and 105MM/155MM artillery rounds as well as other small ammunition items that are determined to be suitable for processing.  The process involves downloading of the submunitions, handling of the submunitions, cryofracture of the submunitions, transfer of the cryofractured  debris into a plasma system, where the debris will be converted in a benign  solid phase (slag) or recovered metal and a clean off gas compliant with  environmental emission requirements. For the plasma arc process portion of  the combined system, the prospective contractor is required to design,  fabricate, start-up, demonstrate and transition the system to full scale  demil operations, as well as obtain all environmental permits and provide training and maintenance documentation. Integration of the system with the cryofracture portion of the process (Government furnished) is also required.  The contractor shall use the existing conceptual design as a starting point  for the detailed design, in order to maximize lessons learned and minimize technical risk. For each of the above projects, the prospective contractor should have the following: a. Experience and familiarity in the design, fabrication, installation, testing, and prove-out of plasma systems tailored for the processing of military munitions, of similar design configuration, size, complexity and throughput as the above. b. Test data supporting the ability to operate plasma furnaces in both oxidizing and reducing environments for a continuous 120 hours without torch electrode replacement. Firms with  experience in the areas cited above should provide a summary of their  company’s capabilities, including a description of facilities, equipment, personnel and past experience to meet this requirement. This shall include documentation describing actual systems designed, fabricated, installed, started-up, tested, and operated, as well as a description of operating  experience including wastes processed, processing rates achieved, operating hours logged, torch electrode life data, and maintenance issues/malfunctions encountered.  Interested firms are invited to indicate their interest by  providing specifications, brochures, and/or drawings within fifteen days of  the date of this notice to US Army RDECOM-ARDEC, ATTN: Francis Sullivan,  AMSRD-AAR-AEE-P, Bldg. 321 Room 5, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-5000, email: fsulliv@pica.army.mil.   The POC for any technical questions is  Francis Sullivan at (973) 724-3538.  In addition, please provide the  company’s name, address, point of contact with telephone number and email address, size of business (small/large) and country represented.  This is a market survey for information only and shall not be construed as a request  for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government.  The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market  survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.

<SUBJECT>A--INTELLIGENT PROPULSION SYSTEMS FOUNDATION TECHNOLOGY DRAFT NRA
<DESC>The Intelligent Propulsion Systems Technology (IPSFT) Sub-Project in the Ultra Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) Project Office, Vehicle Systems Program, intends to solicit proposals for research and development in the area of adaptive turbine engine propulsion technologies to enable intelligent turbine engines that significantly reduce harmful emissions while maintaining high performance and increasing reliability.	 NASA is working to reduce CO2, NOx, aerosols and particulates from the Nation’s airspace, specifically those generated by gas turbine engines used in commercial subsonic and supersonic aircraft. NASA’s current goals are to reduce landing and take-off nitrogen oxides (LTO NOx) by 70% over the 1996 ICAO standard, and to reduce CO2 by 15% from current state-of-the-art large engines, both by 2007.	For planning purposes, NASA’s future goals include increasing these goals to 90% LTO NOx and 30% CO2 reductions.  To achieve this, a new Intelligent Propulsion Systems project will begin in October, 2007, to develop adaptive technologies for modern gas turbine engines to:  1) reduce specific fuel consumption by maintaining optimum performance throughout the engine operating envelope, including transients, 2) greatly reduce engine weight, and hence fuel burn, by reducing design margins, and/or 3) actively control the combustion process to reduce emissions at their source.  In preparation, we are seeking proposals to develop foundation technologies needed for specific adaptive gas turbine engine components. For this solicitation, foundation technologies sought include, but are not limited to: sensor systems, actuation systems, control logic, smart materials, morphing structures, fluid mechanics, physics-based models, measurement technologies, electronics, communications, in-situ power generation, and aerodynamics. This draft solicitation is for information and planning purposes and to allow interested parties the opportunity to furnish comments on all aspects of the draft.  No proposal is required, and no contract will be awarded as a result of this draft solicitation. Prospective offerors are invited to: 1.	   Comment on all aspects of the draft solicitation, including requirements, schedules, proposal instructions, and evaluation approaches; 2.	   Identify unnecessary or inefficient requirements; and 3.        Identify any perceived safety, occupational health, security (including information technology security), environmental, export control, and/or other programmatic risk issues associated with performance of the work.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only Solicitation; proposals are being requested on or before 4 P.M. local prevailing time on April 22, 2004 and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. SOLICITATION NUMBER N1191040025 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Wayside Exhibit Quality Porcelain Enamel Imaging.  This is a total Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 339950.  Size standard is 500 employees.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in affect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-20. It is anticipated that up to two (2) awards will be made on or about June 4, 2004. Award(s) will be for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price Contract for one year with a one year option period.  The Contractor will be guaranteed a minimum workload of $3,000 and the maximum workload limit will be $300,000 for year one.  Year two will have a guaranteed minimum workload of $3,000 and the maximum workload limit will be $300,000. If a Contractor declines to propose or declines work offered by the National Park Service at any time during the contract period, the estimated amount of the project will be subtracted against the minimum guaranteed workload in this contract. BACKGROUND: As one of the nation's principal conservation agencies, the National Park Service (NPS) has the responsibility to protect some of our most treasured natural and cultural resources. In order to preserve these treasures it is important that they be interpreted in ways that help NPS visitors experience them, understand them, and appreciate their value.  It is also important that those who visit National Park sites be assured that their visits are safe and enjoyable.   Since its earliest days, the NPS has relied on a variety of interpretive media to assist in the effort to protect its resources and to assure the pleasure and safety of its visitors.  Among the various media used by the NPS, wayside exhibits provide the most direct interpretation of park sites and features.  Because they are located in a park's outdoor environment, "waysides" offer immediate -- and readily available -- sources of information tailored to a specific place and time.  No other interpretive medium can match the power of direct association of information and resource, or the convenience of on-site location.   Currently, NPS wayside exhibit panels are produced in a limited number of standard sizes and configurations.  Exhibit panels are usually made in either of three sizes (24"w x 36"h, 24"w x 42"h, or 36"w x 48"h) and in either of two materials (fiberglass embedded screen imaged paper or porcelain-enameled steel panels.) PURPOSE: This contract is to meet the porcelain enamel imaging requirements of the Department of the Interior, National Park Service and occasionally other agencies of the Government, by providing fabrication of exhibit quality porcelain enamel imaging on a variety of substrates intended for outdoor use.  All work performed under this contract will be directed by the issuance of Task Orders in accordance with procedures outlined in Section G of the resulting contract.  In no event will the Government be responsible for any work performed by the Contractor that is not undertaken pursuant to a Task Order authorized by the Contracting Officer.  SCOPE OF WORK: Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment and facilities (except as otherwise specified), necessary to provide exhibit quality porcelain enamel imaging on a variety of substrates intended for outdoor use.   Other services related to the rehabilitation of porcelain enamel exhibits include graphic layout, film mechanical preparation and final exhibit panel inspection/finishing and are also a part of this contract. Specifically, the following services are required: A. PORCELAIN ENAMEL IMAGING  (1)	Image in tight register in up to nine (9) colors on a panel size range from 6" x 9" up to 42" x 72".

B. FILM PREPARATION - The preparation of film mechanicals (positives and negatives) to include the development of graphic layouts based on Government-Furnished design concepts. This phase is intended to support the production of the previously described porcelain enamel imaging and will involve specifically:  (1) Creation of original layouts (exhibit designs), based on design concepts furnished by the Government.

No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2. No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the close of the Dynamic Pricing Event may not automatically be awarded the contract or purchase order that results from this solicitation. 3. Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror (s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation.

<DESC>Holloman AFB seeks proposals for a flashover fire training unit with educational program. The contractor is to furnish all labor, parts, facilities, and transportation necessary to deliver and install the unit at Holloman AFB, NM, and conduct training in its operation, maintenance, and use. Holloman will purchase the system based on a best value determination. Selection criteria and factors follow. 
   The unit is to be equal to that manufactured by Flashover Systems Inc., of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and all submissions must be accompanied by technical specifications regarding selection factors 1, 2, and 4. Selection of best value will be made by comparing submitted (and documented) technical specifications to those of the unit specified as the standard for selection factors 1 and 2. Any technical specification pertaining to Safety or Durability not matching or exceeding those of the standard will automatically disqualify the proposed unit. Selection factor 3 will be judged by the customer (Holloman AFB Fire Department) based on their professional experience and expertise, and is necessarily a subjective comparison. Selection factor 4 is part of the basic requirement of this solicitation. If it is quoted as an accessory or extra cost, the submitted unit will be disqualified. This does not, however, preclude itemizing of the various items of the proposal. Selection factors 5 and 6 will be used as a last resort in the event of a tie among submitted units.
   Selection factors, in descending order of importance, are:
1.	Safety Compliance – at minimum, NFPA standards 1001, 1403, 1500, and OSHA standards 1910.23, and 1910.134.
2.	Durability – the unit should be reasonably expected to last 10 years, assuming usage is not excessive and a regular periodic maintenance program with minor touch up painting. A warranty will suffice as documentation for this factor.
3.	Ease of operation and maintenance – primarily a subjective judgment. See above.
4.	Training program – standard with the unit. Content and methodology are required documentation for this factor.
5.	Stationary unit – preferred, but trailer-mounted is acceptable.
6.	Price – absolutely the least important factor.

STATEMENT OF WORK
FOR
UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY
BATTERY AND CABINET REPLACEMENT
BUILDING 301, WEST WING
MARCH  2004

1.0  SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES.  remove and dispose of all batteries in the battery room for 400 KVA EXIDE UPS system model  3330AF,(bldg 301 n/w corner). remove and dispose of the eight EXIDE cabinets and 279 batteries. Provide and install 93 batteries and two cabinets.

2.0  CONTRACTOR TASKS.

2.1  The contractor shall remove the 279 Power brand  TC-12100 batteries now in the battery room. each cabinet has 31 batteries installed. The contractor shall remove the eight EXIDE  battery cabinets and associated wiring now in the battery room, leaving the Power CR6 cabinet. All removed items shall be disposed in compliance with applicable EPA requirements. 

2.2 The contractor shall provide and install two each battery cabinets, INTRAPACK IC06, or POWER CR6, or equivalent.  The contractor shall provide and install a 600 amp disconnect for each of these new cabinets. The breaker can be in the cabinet or mounted on the wall.

3.0  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE   The contractor shall complete all work within 30 days of contract award. Work shall be performed during normal duty hours, Monday through Friday 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. Excluding federal holidays

answers to extraneous questions

1. five of the old batteries have split cases.

2. the exide cabinets now in use are 32X32X72 inch closed cabinets.

3. the batteries to be removed are 12X10X7 inches and 66 pounds each.

4.disconnect to be on load side only. alarm connection is not required.  location of disconnect on each of the new cabinet is optional, so long as it can be operated without removing any any part of the cabinet.


Items 1.0; 2.1; 2.3; 2.4
1)     Thirty-one (31) 12-volt batteries equal a DC bus of 372 volts.  If the specification of the DC bus on the ups indicated is accurately reported as 422 volts, the 31 battery requirement per cabinet seems inaccurate.  To obtain a 422 volt DC bus using 12V batteries, 35 batteries per cabinet are required (422 / 12 = 35).
a.      Please advise if the UPS DC Bus is accurately reported as 422 volts?
b.     Please advise if the number of batteries per cabinet should be 31 or 35?
c.     Please advise if the total number of batteries desired is 93 or 105?
The SOW doesn't contain the term '12 volts'. 6 cell lead-acid batteries such as those listed in the SOW are generally referred to as 12 volt. however,a fully charged battery of this type has an actual voltage of 13 and a fraction

Items 2.2 and 3.4
 
1) Is not a UV shunt trip desired for disconnect on each of the two new battery cabinets?  A UV shunt is not required.
 
Item 2.2
 
1)     Specification does not address utilization of refurbished battery cabinets.  As battery cabinets are basically sheet metal boxes and occasionally changed by customers, are manufacturer designed refurbished cabinets acceptable versus new cabinets?
a.      Considerable dollars can be saved by the Government using this solution.  
b.     Interior electrical components (breakers, wiring, batteries) are all new and enable UL rating to be maintained.
c.     Exterior and interior of sheet metal are freshly painted and cosmetically reflect new cabinets without the additional cost
 
2)     Are refurbished manufacture specified battery cabinets acceptable?
 Refurbished cabinets are not acceptable.

 Item 2.2
 
1)      To ensure we are understanding the battery cabinet specification correctly, INTRAPACK IC06 or POWER CR6 or EQUIVALENT battery cabinets may be utilized?  Yes
Item 2.3
 
1)     To ensure we are understanding the specification correctly with respect to new batteries, only Model S12V370 (GNB) 
     or C&D or DEKA batteries may be proposed?
a.      Power Batteries are unacceptable?
Power Batteries are not acceptable.

1)     Will existing termination cables be used to connect the new cabinets?  Existing cables can be used.
2)     Will the cable from cabinets removed need to be mined out?  Cables from removed cabinets are to also be removed.
3)     Verify DC link is 422 volts ( this voltage is not real common, could be a specific need for customer)  DC link is 422 volts.
4)     Verify 31 batteries per cabinet (odd # of batteries)
5)     Verify Power CR6 cabinet is what they want (spec sheet indicates that this cabinet will accommodate only 30 batteries)  31 batteries per string is correct.  CR6 is one option, if you prefer, IC06 can be used.
6)     What type of access to work area (loading dock, ramp, any stairs or raised floor) The building does have a loading dock,2 1/2 to 3 feet above ground level. there are no ramps, stares or raised floors involved in this project.

7)     Is there a staging area for the equipment.  There is no staging area.


- I wanted to verify that there was an onsite electrician that would be performing the electrical work from the "load side"of  the new disconnects being provided back to the UPS, or , should we include this in our scope of work?  This must be included in the scope of work.

-   I would like to submit a bid for the above solicitation; however, I am concerned about the request.  The dimensions for the existing battery is:  L-12 W-6.68 H-9.71.  Request is for C&D Technologies 12-370FR battery.  Those dimensions are L-13.42 W-6.80 H-9.48.  In my opinion, the 12-370FR battery is the very best manufactured for this environment, but due to size cannot fit into the existing cabinet.  Only 10 batteries of this size (and that includes the north star)  will fit on each shelf.  There is space above the top shelf to install a rack with the other battery.  

-   I would like someone to look at the cabinet and let me know if the rails on the inside are welded or bolted down.  The four rails on the periphery of each shelf are welded to the cabinet.  The working space is 37 1/2  X  28 inches.  This is large enough to accommodate the footprint of 11and ½,  12-370FR  batteries.

- I wanted to verify that there was an onsite electrician that would be performing the electrical work from the "load side"of  the new disconnects being provided back to the UPS, or , should we include this in our scope of work?  This must be included in the scope of work.

-   I would like to submit a bid for the above solicitation; however, I am concerned about the request.  The dimensions for the existing battery is:  L-12 W-6.68 H-9.71.  Request is for C&D Technologies 12-370FR battery.  Those dimensions are L-13.42 W-6.80 H-9.48.  In my opinion, the 12-370FR battery is the very best manufactured for this environment, but due to size cannot fit into the existing cabinet.  Only 10 batteries of this size (and that includes the north star)  will fit on each shelf.  There is space above the top shelf to install a rack with the other battery.  

-   I would like someone to look at the cabinet and let me know if the rails on the inside are welded or bolted down.  The four rails on the periphery of each shelf are welded to the cabinet.  The working space is 37 1/2  X  28 inches.  This is large enough to accommodate the footprint of 11and ½,  12-370FR  batteries.

6 Project Descriptions and Profile

  As host to the world’s largest natural gas reserves and eighth largest oil reserves, and as the largest exporter of gas and second largest exporter of oil, Russia plays a central role in today’s world energy markets.  In the last few years, Russia’s economy has been fuelled primarily by oil and gas sales that stem from increased domestic production and higher oil prices.  The Russian government has stated as a priority to diversify its economy and liberalize its energy sector, while private and oil gas companies seek to expand in a liberalized market place.  As the world’s oil consumers seek to diversify their sources of oil and gas from the Middle East, international focus on and interest in Russian energy policy and infrastructure has increased substantially. 

On a recent visit to Moscow, USTDA officials met with project sponsors about potential USTDA participation in several oil and gas projects.  These projects include:  construction of a new oil pipeline to Murmansk and construction of an export facility there; construction of a new pipeline that would carry refined oil products to Primorsk; construction of an ethylene plant in Kazan; and construction of a gas processing plant near the Tomsk petrochemical plant.
