<DESC>The District Government?s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), a element of the Office of Chief Financial Officer of the District of Columbia, has requirements from time to time for the supply of ongoing technical support and assistance for payroll operations, production and processing, as well as routine system maintenance and support for its Unified Personnel and Payroll System (UPPS).   The UPPS system is an internally developed mainframe based system utilizing COBOL, CICS, VSAM, ALC, FOCUS, and ADABAS as the base languages, with ADABAS being the database for this system.  The OCIO is currently responsible for generating bi-weekly and semi-monthly pay for approximately 35,000 employees.
The OCIO requires routine system and production support services to ensure the orderly generation of payroll (both live checks and direct deposits) and accounting data in the UPPS system.  The majority of this work is cyclical and will be accomplished in an IT production environment, where deadlines must be strictly observed and time frames for work are frequently short.  Additional work will include assistance in documenting current system design and architecture, job streams and production activities.  This work will also involve and be associated with functional and system requirements and definition for potential replacement systems.  When the OCIO has a requirement for the services of individual technicians with specific skills and abilities (as described below) to provide ongoing support for operations, production and processing, the vendor will provide individuals to act as on-site managers for the group of individual technicians provided.  

----

c.    Routine inquiry and problem investigation and resolution;  
d.    Documenting job streams and processing routines;
e.     Documenting and compiling system maintenance activities;
f.      Implementing periodic updates to the system;
g.    Assistance in preparing and producing year end and W-2 data;
h.    Analyzing the system and advising the OCIO on system improvements and upgrades;
i.     Coordinating system operations with other, ongoing payroll system projects;
j.     Coordinating system operations with monthly retired pay and pension production activities;
k.    Ongoing support to assure the continuity of the UPPS payroll environment;          
l.     Ongoing operation of the legacy Financial Management System (FMS), including:
        (1)    development and production of system extracts and reports;
        (2)    support of fixed asset accounting;
        (3)    balancing and reconciling SOAR general ledger accounts
        (4)    supporting labor distribution reporting;
        (5)    ensuring payroll data correctly loaded into accounting systems;
m.   Reviewing and assessing the work done in an initial phase of rate file, table and pay schedule consolidation project;
n.     Documenting rate file and pay schedule consolidation work done to date; 
o.   Assuring the efficacy of the schedules being consolidated and minimizing any resulting adverse consequences to the overall system.
---
Knowledge, Skills, Experience and Abilities required of individuals a vendor might assign to the work:  
a.    having familiarity with an OS390 mainframe environment, TSO, ISPF, COBOL, ALC, ADABAS and DB2, as well as CICS, CSP, VSAM, and FOCUS;
b.    having, or be able to promptly acquire
       (1)  familiarity with all technical aspects of the UPPS type payroll systems;
       (2) familiarity with the operational and procedural aspects of the UPPS type payroll systems.
