<DESC>The New Mexico Veterans Affairs Health Care System (NMVAHCS), 1501 San Pedro Drive SE, Albuquerque NM 87108, intends to negotiate a sole-source commercial (FAR Part 12) supplies contract with Thermal Products Solution P.O. Box 3246, Williamsport, PA 17701-0246 in accordance with FAR Part 6.302- 1. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses will be  those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-05.  The contract shall provide the VA Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC) with quantity four (4) Lunair Temperature/Humidity Systems.  The Center owns and operates two current systems of this type. Additional systems are needed for increasing stability studies and to determine true shelf life of products.  This integration into the Center’s quality operation will enhance the quality of our product.  This is considered to be a sole source because having all chambers from the same manufacture simplifies operation and service maintenance.  Since Thermo Products Solutions is the manufacturer of this equipment they are the owner of the diagrams, manuals, proprietary parts, specifications and most importantly the validation protocols.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest to the Contracting Officer no later than 1400 Mountain Standard Time, August 24, 2005. A determination by the Government not to compete the action based on responses is solely within the Government’s discretion. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive proposal.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of NMVAHCS.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, or by facsimile at (505) 248-3206.

Unique Qualifications:  The proposed contractor, Mr. Robert J. Berendt has unique qualifications to perform the range of tasks involved in this contract.  He has over 30 years experience as a strategic planner and facilitator.  A former Senior Vice President of the Taft Group, Inc, he also served on the development and public relations staff at The George Washington University as well as on the marketing and editorial staff of the Smithsonian Associates a branch of the Smithsonian Institution.  Berendt Associates is a diversified consulting firm providing professional services in organizational planning and management services to tax-exempt institutions, corporations, trade associations, and government agencies since 1986.  Berendt Associates offers management and planning assistance to evaluate current organizational structures, to develop thoughtful and imaginative plans of action, and to create strategies leading to growth, enhanced efficiency, productivity, and financial security.  Among the specific services offered are, design and direction of strategic or long-range planning programs; organization-wide audits of staffing, program design, or governance; evaluations, mediation, and other assistance related to mergers, strategic alliances, or organizational restructuring; development of staff, management, and/or board training programs; and planning facilitation of special meetings, conferences, and retreats.  Mr. Berendt has extensive experience working with various organizations to include college and universities; hospital and related health care organizations; voluntary agencies; national and international organizations; and government agencies, including NIH and other Public Health Service agencies.  His specialties include strategic planning; functional and structural analysis; management evaluation and design; merger assessment and mediation; and management development.  Mr. Berendt’s past government consulting assignments have included planning, management, and organizational improvement projects with federal agencies including the NIH, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the EPA, and the NIST, as well as state government agencies in Georgia, Illinois, and Pennsylvania.  Mr. Berendt’s unique qualifications include the following experience especially germane to the task of developing a strategic plan for a government biomedical research agency:  He designed and directed a strategic planning process for the PHS, NIH for the PHS Life Sciences Education and Science Literacy Board, a group representing all PHS agencies seeking the application of PHS resources in support of improved life sciences teaching and enhanced scientific literacy and understanding among the public-at-large.  He designed and directed for Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital in Baltimore a comprehensive strategic planning process, focusing on a related Foundation created as part of a corporate reorganization.  A major program analysis was included.  For the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia he also designed and facilitated a comprehensive strategic planning initiative addressing critical issues in education, clinical and basic research, delivery of patient services, and advancement, public affairs, and outreach.  He provided for the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, DC a strategic planning support to internal project directors in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, and served as planning advisor and facilitator for a national science education outreach initiative funded by the DeWitt Wallace/Reader’s Digest Fund, and a science/equity pilot project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York.  For the United Cerebral Palsy Associations, Washington, DC in response to a UCPA initiative to enhance and support management and planning practices among its nationwide affiliates, Mr. Berendt designed and presented a management training program, developed a manual providing guidelines for strategic planning, and conducted two advanced seminars at the annual convention.  He also planned and facilitated the first “futures conference” for the national Bureau of Standards and Technology, Advanced Technology Program in Gaithersburg, Maryland, designed to secure from leading economists input on potential program evaluation methodologies.  Of particular importance to the current statement of work, Mr. Berendt provided key expertise to the NCRR in the development of their last two strategic plans.  He planned, advised, and facilitated a strategic planning process for NCRR involving multi-disciplinary representation from the clinical and basic research communities, culminating in the publication of NCRR: A Catalyst for Discovery.  His expertise and experience are of great importance to NIEHS, since we are employing the same model for strategic plan development that has been previously used by NCRR.  Mr. Berendt’s familiarity with the process will also ensure that he will be able to perform these tasks for NIEHS under the extremely tight timeline envisioned for the production of the strategic plan.  Mr. Berendt’s performance and experience with the above listed strategic planning and facilitating assignments prove he possesses the unique qualifications and level of skills that enable him to perform the services required by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.  His expert skills will provide continuity and timely completion of the review and analysis of background data and will ensure an optimal outcome of the Strategic Planning Conference.

<DESC>The government anticipates awarding a contract to provide program development and management expertise to centrally lead the staffing, planning, implementation, and evaluation of the AF Health Promotion Program across various installations.  The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and will include a basic year plus two(2) annual option periods.     This acquisition will be solicitated and awarded utilizing FAR subpart 12, Commercial Acquisitions, procedures.     The solicitation will be unrestricted.     The applicable North American Industry Classification code is 621399 - Professional and Allied HealthCare Staffing Service - ($6.0 size std).     Offers will be evaluated utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPTO) procedures.     The Government intends to award without discussion but reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary in making the award decision.     Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).     Offerors may submit on-line Representation and Certification Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.     Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.     Techniques utilizing past performance information and price will be evaluated; therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror.     The solicitation will be made electronically at http://www.eps.gov on/or about 19 Aug 05, with a closing date for receipt of offers on or about 09 Sep 2005.

However, the solicitation may be posted before or after this projected date.     Offerors must submit proposals following the format prescribed in FAR 52.212-2, Instructions to Offerors.     The Contractor must submit two (2) complete paper copies of the proposal plus one complete electronic version compatible with Windows XP (zip disk not acceptable).     Offerors must be registered in the CCR (http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil) to be eligible for award.     Since this requirement includes options, FAR 52.232-19, Availability of Funds Next Fiscal Year, applies.     The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, whether before or after RFP closing, with no obligations.     Proposal preparation cost will be borne by offerors submitting proposals in response to the solicitation.

Description

The US Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Directorate (AFRL/DE) seeks proposals for the development and execution of models for the excitation of molecular oxygen to the singlet-delta state by electric discharge for use in oxygen-iodine lasers.  Developed models should include sufficient dimensionality as necessary to capture the pertinent physics, and should include adequate descriptions for the physics pertinent to the plasma generation of singlet-delta oxygen including chemical kinetics, electron kinetics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics.  Coupled CFD-plasmadynamic models may be developed and utilized as necessary.  The award contractor will use these models to develop optimal electric oxygen-iodine laser (E-OIL) system designs and operating parameters in support of AFRL/DE experiment activities, requiring close AFRL/DE – contractor collaboration.  

Develop a computational model of the AFRL E-OIL device that enables the exploration of system designs and operating parameters, including RF discharge frequency and power, DC power, pulse rate and voltage, chemical constituent mixtures, excited specie concentrations, and gas flow rates and pressures.   

Validate the computational model against the existing AFRL E-OIL device and other appropriate devices.   

Use the computational model to determine the following parameters and establish an optimal design and operating parameters for a follow on E-OIL system.  
	
Optimum DC Pulser / RF Sustainer ratio
	Optimum chemical concentrations
	Maximum O2(a1Äg) yields expected 
	Energy efficiency (energy into plasma, energy into O2(a1Äg))

Periodic reports documenting technical progress will be required in addition to a final technical report.
The estimated budget for this project is $180,000.00. Performance period of approximately 1 year.

GENERAL INFORMATION:

The Government anticipates awarding a single cost plus fixed fee contract  for a period of 12 months, but reserves the right to award a FAR procurement instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed.  The contract award is anticipated to be unclassified.  In the event the Government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror, we reserve the right to conduct negotiations with another offeror.  If the offeror is a large business, any resultant contract will include a subcontracting plan, which must be submitted prior to award.  

An “Administrative Access to Proprietary Information” consent provision is applicable to this solicitation with anticipation of incorporation of the provision by reference into any resulting award instrument.  The provision is included as an attachment to this solicitation.  It must either be signed and submitted with the proposal or objections must be submitted as indicated on the consent form.  See Attachment  3.

Foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the respective Contracting Officers or Project Managers before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.     

It is expected that contractors may have access to, or generate, data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws. Therefore, offerors will need to be certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) prior to award. Contact the US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572), or logon to http://www.dlis.dla.mil/CCAL for further information on certification and the approval process.     Also, DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, must be completed by the successful offeror and processed prior to award of a contract.  All DOE Federally Funded Research & Development Centers (FFRDCs) and DOD FFRDCs C3I Lab, Lincoln Laboratory or Software Engineering Institute may submit proposals in response to this solicitation.  Other FFRDCs or contractors that propose using FFRDCs not discussed herein shall provide rationale in the proposal that research is within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort or special competency of the FFRDC and that the research to be performed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with the private sector. Offerors must mark their proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 52.215-1(e). 

For the purposes of this acquisition, the business size standard is 1000 employees, NAICS 541710. The acquisition is unrestricted, full and open competition. All firms submitting responses must reference this announcement and indicate whether they are, or are not, a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, an 8(a) firm, a woman-owned business, HUBubzone certified small business, a historically black college or university, a minority institution, a veteran-owned small business or a service-disabled veteran-owned small business.     

Open communication with the Technical POC is encouraged until proposals are received.  Evaluators may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the evaluations.  Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort.  Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government.

There will be no other solicitation issued for this requirement.  Offerors should monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov  in the event this solicitation is amended.

BASIS FOR AWARD:

Proposals will be evaluated using the following factors in descending order of importance based on technical peer review:  (a) Overall scientific/technical merit and soundness of approach of the proposed effort and its significance to DoD and AFRL/DE,  (b) Capabilities and related experience, techniques, or unique combinations of these which are an integral factor for achieving proposal objectives, and (c) Affordability.

The purpose of this project is to assay stored serum for CRP and SAA in the laboratory of Dr. Mark Wener at the University of Washington.  Assays shall be performed on serum that is to be drawn at the twenty-four (24) month interview from eligible women.   These women are currently part of the HEAL study where prior data and future data has been and will continue to be collected and processed.  Dr. Wener is a collaborator with the HEAL study investigators and is a leading expert in this technique.  The laboratory of Dr. Mark Wener at the University of Washington is the only source known to the NCI that can provide assay services and has extensive experience in C-reactive protein and serum amyloid for clinical research and studies.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the current study in progress.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to add three labor categories and increase the maximum hours for the duration of the existing contract for Randstad US, L.P. to support the increase in the workload at the Wheeling office West Virginia Field Benefit Administration (FBA)   This FBA office recently received two fairly large plans.  The office needs Assistant Project Manager and Benefits Team Leaders to support the management and supervise and also provide guidance on the administration of the large plans.  To manage the increasing workload of scanning participant files this office needs a full time Image Scanner.  The additional labor categories and labor hours are necessary to continue the administration of the large plans.  This is a continuation of work already undertaken by the existing provider.  It is in the best interest of the PBGC for the current provider to complete this work by adding labor categories and increasing labor hours under the existing contract. The increase under the existing contract will ensure the continuity in the work.  This is not a request for proposal.  See Note 22.

Xenobiotic Detection System is the exclusive assignee of the patent rights for CALUX (US Patent No. 5,854,010) and they are  therefore the only known source available to meet the Government's needs.  CALUX offers the only bioassay procedure with sufficient sensitivity, selectivity, and consistency, as well as its correlation to traditional, mass spectroscopy detection to fulfill the proposal requirements for the  detection of dioxin and dioxin-like compounds at less than 0.1 pg/g limits of detection.  The parts per trillion limits of detection are necessary for fulfilling the objectives of the statement of work in detecting 17 critical dioxin/furan congeners.  The invention and art described in this patent  and patent application is critical in fulfilling the criteria described in the statement of work.  The sensitivity of the CALUX bioassay system (ppt) to all 17 critical congers is unique to Xenobiotic Detection Systems.  The CALUX bioassay is an inexpensive method for screening large volumes of  samples with minimal use of solvents and sample volumes.  This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  A statement of work and any other applicable documents  will be made available upon request.  The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please send your documentation to Angela Schopler at the office identified above, by fax (513)  487-2109 or by email at schopler.angela@epa.gov.  Phone requests will not be honored.  Documentation must be received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by the EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to compete Apple Xserve RAID as part of an overall SAN solution.  We use Linux as our operating system.  It plays a major role in our data and system administration.  We take full advantage of open source software (Perl programming language, C and C++) and non-recurring licensing fees on software.  The Apple Xserve RAID is fully compliant with Linux and will allow us to satisfy a requirement to have independent, 5.6 TB RAID drives (compatible with NIST’s existing configuration), that provide maximum flexibility to reconfigure the SANs.  Classified information can easily be moved to a secure location with out an impact on the entire SAN.  The Xserve RAID hardware will allow NIST to leverage our existing Apple hardware and open source software applications running on Linux while providing a modular mean of extending storage and computational power.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, all quotations received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed brand name based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a, competitive, brand name procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, Center for Substance Abuse and Prevention (CSAP) through The Program Support Center, plan to award a 12 month sole source simplified, fixed price acquisition to CADCA, 625 Slater Lane, Suite 300, Alexandria, VA 22314.  CADCA was formed in 1992 in response to the President’s Drug Advisory Council seeking a way to provide support, training and technical assistance for the growing number of anti-drug coalitions in America.  SAMHSA/CSAP will host the annual grantee meeting for the Drug Free Communities grantees on February 13, 2006 at the Washington, D.C. Convention Center prior to the start of the CADCA Leadership Forum on February 14, 2006 in order to extend the scope and reach of training available to grantees through a combined meeting and conference.  The grant application workshop will be held in January (date to be determined) and will be a one-day training at a location (to be determined) in the center of the country.   Joint planning with CADCA will reduce duplication of efforts and increase the overall learning experience for grantees.  By maintaining advisory communications and dialogue; marketing to all elements of the national prevention community; and archiving conference feedback and evaluations, CADCA’s experience and expertise in working with community coalitions will greatly strengthen the core content and execution of SAMHSA/CSAP’s annual grantee meeting.  SAMHSA/CSAP will be able to draw upon   CADCA’s unique experience in preparing, marketing, conducting, trouble-shooting and evaluating this event, which will now be the platform for the SAMHSA/CSAP annual grantee meeting.   The Proposed Simplified Acquisition Action Is For Supplies And Services For Which The Government Intends To Solicit And Negotiate With Only One Source.  This Acquisition Is Being Posted In Accordance With FAR 5.201(b)(1). In Accordance With FAR 19.502(a), The Contracting Officer Has Determined That There Is Not A Reasonable Expectation Of Obtaining Offers From Two Or More Responsible Small Business Concerns That Are Competitive In Terms Of Market Price, Quality And Delivery; Interested Persons May Identify Their Interest And Capability To Respond To The Requirements Or Submit Proposals Within 10 Days After The Date Of Publication Of This Notice.  A Determination By The Government Not To Complete This Proposed Simplified Acquisition Based Upon Responses To This Notice Is Solely Within The Discretion Of The Government.  Information Received Will Normally Be Considered Solely For The Purpose Of Determining Whether To Conduct A Competitive Procurement.  No Solicitation Is Available.

<DESC>The Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service (CRS) works exclusively for the United States Congress, providing research, analysis, and information support to the members and committees of the House and Senate.  CRS staff works directly with Congress on a daily basis to help the Congress identify, analyze, and formulate legislative proposals. They perform in-depth policy, legal, and procedural analyses; identify and assess policy alternatives and their implications; assist in framing legislative proposals; identify and evaluate new research findings, data, and information sources; and deliver expert testimony before Congressional committees.  Their work takes the form of written analytical reports and confidential memoranda, educational seminars and workshops, and in-person briefings and telephone consultations.  CRS also provides the Congress with a wide range of specialized reference and information services.

The CRS maintains its own Mail Room to provide sorting of incoming mail and books (intended for Congressional offices, the CRS, or other Library offices), and to provide for the delivery and pickup service of mail and books for Congress.  The CRS Mail Room is located in the James Madison Building of the Library of Congress (LOC).  Congressional deliveries/pickups are made to/from various offices in four House office buildings (the Cannon, the Longworth, the Ford, and the Rayburn), three Senate office buildings (the Russell, the Dirksen, and the Hart), the LOC John Adams Building, and the United States Capitol Building.  CRS maintains two Research Centers in the Rayburn House and Russell Senate office buildings.

The CRS Divisions and Offices are located on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors of the James Madison Building.  The Mail Room personnel will provide for the pickup, sorting, and distribution of mail for CRS Divisions and Offices; pickup of mail and information resources from the LOC Postal Services Unit, as well as pickup and distribution of documents from the Government Printing Office (GPO).

CRS maintains two Service-wide, shared conference rooms (LM 316 and LM 426), used by its staff for meetings, briefings, training, seminars and social functions.  The Mail Room personnel will provide “setups” for these two conference rooms, i.e., arrange the table, chairs, etc, in the required layout/style (theater, boardroom, classroom, etc.) for the functions and restoration of the rooms after the functions.

CRS maintains two central Copy Centers (LM 224 and LM 321) and 51 separate copy machine locations throughout the Divisions and Offices.  The Mail Room personnel will distribute CRS’ weekly shipments of copy paper to the Copy Centers and the individual copier locations in the Divisions and Offices. 
				

//SCOPE OF WORK//

The requirements as specified in this document shall provide for the full operation and supervision of personnel assigned to the CRS Mail Room, including, (1) pickup and sorting of incoming mail, books, and information resources, (2) delivery and pickup service of mail and books for Congress, (3) pickup, sorting, and distribution of mail for all CRS divisions and offices, (4) pickup and distribution of documents from the Government Printing Office, (5) setup of two shared conference rooms, and (6) distribution of copy paper shipments. 	

	Provisions for supplies and maintenance of equipment (including strapping machines, photocopiers and FAX machines) located in the CRS Mail Room are the responsibility of CRS.  The Contracting Officers’ Technical Representative (COTR) shall have authority for issues related to the working environment, contractor’s performance (to include quality, timeliness, and delivery service operation), and equipment changes and operability.   

Contractor personnel shall present a business-like appearance, be service oriented, and provide quality service in a timely manner and with a pleasant attitude. All contractor personnel assigned to this project shall be thoroughly familiar with the required delivery routes and procedures, the tracking system, and shall be fully trained by the contractor prior to assuming duties.

Confidentiality is a basic component of the CRS mission.  The contractor shall understand this requirement and shall instruct and advise all contractor personnel assigned to perform the CRS Mail Room tasks to maintain confidentiality regarding any knowledge they have of books or packages being delivered to any Congressional office.

The operation of the Congressional delivery service shall require knowledge and experience in the operation of high volume, time-sensitive delivery services as specified in this document.  The period of performance shall begin upon contract award approximately January 1, 2006 and run through December 31, 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

<CONTACT>Della Glenn, Contracts Officer, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email contract@ustda.gov
<DESC>The following questions were received and answered regarding  announcement for Aviation Security Quality Control - Technical Assistance/Training Programs initially synopsized under USTDA-05-Q-91-358.  The requirement of the Government has not changed. 


The following are questions regarding the subject solicitation:

1.  Regarding the number of participants, for costing purposes, the RFP 
indicates 25 participants for training in Guam in Section B, but 24 
participants for Guam in Section C.  Please clarify. 

RESPONSE: The correct number of participants for Guam is 24.  I apologize for any confusion.    

2.  Regarding M&IE, how would this be handled for the three days that the 
Contractor will be providing breakfast and lunch each day and one dinner for 
each participant?  Should full M&IE be given to participants each day 
regardless of how many meals they actually have to pay for?  This 
information is necessary for costing purposes.  

RESPONSE: Full M&IE should be given to participants each day regardless of how many meals they actually have to pay for.  

3.  The RFP indicates that the Contractor will provide participants’ 
assistance with travel logistics, but participants will be required to pay 
their own airfare.  Can you please clarify exactly what this would entail?  
Would the Contractor be expected to identify potential schedules and cost 
estimates for participants to select and book/pay for themselves.  Would the 
Contractor be expected to front payment in some/all instances for subsequent 
reimbursement at a later date - by the participants/TDA?  Both can be a 
significant burden on the contractor in terms of time/labor and cost, given 
the number of participants and the number of countries they may be coming 
from.  In particular, the latter could pose a significant cost burden for 
the contractor depending on how quickly and easily reimbursement is 
received, and how many participants were involved.  Please clarify your 
expectations for costing purposes.  Note that this question relates to 
travel costs above the $30,000 contingency fund that TDA has set aside for 
travel assistance. 

RESPONSE: The Contractor is expected to identify potential schedules and cost estimates for participants to book/pay for flights themselves.  The Contractor would NOT be expected to front payment in ANY instance for subsequent reimbursement at a later date by either participants of USTDA.    

4.  Is the $30,000 budget for additional travel assistance included within 
the original $600,000 ceiling or in addition to the ceiling?

RESPONSE: The $30,000 budget for additional travel assistance is included within the $600,000 ceiling.

5.  Visas.  There is a line item in the suggested costing spreadsheet for 
visas for the participants.  First, it would appear that this could also be 
a requirement for Contractor staff, depending on the country.  Should such 
cost be included in the proposal?  Second, regarding Visas for the 
participants, we assume that this line item is for the direct cost 
associated with obtaining the visa (process the paperwork), and NOT for 
labor to obtain the Visas, i.e., the Contractor is not expected to carry out 
all the steps necessary to apply for and obtain a visa for the participants 
where required.  Please confirm or clarify. 

RESPONSE: The cost of visas (for both participants and Contractor staff) should be included in the proposal.  The line item is for the direct cost associated with obtaining visas for participants.  The Contractor is expected to carry out the steps necessary to obtain a visa for the participants where required.  The labor costs for this is included in the $600,000 ceiling and was accounted for when developing the budget. 

6.  Section L.2 paragraph c. subparagraph(5) Section 5, Price Schedule. 
states that a completed price schedule (from Section B) will be included in 
Volume II.  Are the vendors required to submit the USTDA Conference/Training 
Cost Worksheet that was included in the attachments of the solicitation?

RESPONSE: Vendors are required to submit the USTDA Conference/Training Cost Worksheet that was included in the attachments of the solicitation.  This will ensure that USTDA receives cost proposals in a uniform format that will enable us to evaluate proposals efficiently.

The USGS intends to award a noncompetitive procurement to the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services may submit a capabilities statement to the contracting officer no later than the closing date of this requirement (08/30/2005) 4:00 PM MST.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist; if no submissions are received by the above appointed time, the Government will proceed with noncompetitive award without further notice.  This is NOT a Request for Quote (RFQ); the Government does not anticipate issuing a written solicitation.  No number notes apply.  Any questions please contact Gail Walker, Purchasing Agent, at (303) 236-9334 or email gwalker@usgs.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Dr. Ilmutdin M. Abdulagatov of Superior, Colorado, to procure his services for the implementation and enhancement of data capture procedures (with Guided Data Capture (GDC) software developed at NIST) for thermophysical and thermochemical properties of pure compounds, binary and ternary mixtures, and chemical reactions with preliminary critical data evaluation.  Implementation of data quality assessment (DQA) procedures for the captured data through compilation in the SOURCE Database and application of ThermoData Engine software developed and maintained by the Thermodynamics Research Center (NIST/TRC) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado.  Development of DQA algorithms and implementation for volumetric properties of pure components in the SOURCE Database, also developed and maintained by NIST/TRC. Extensive experience in experimental chemical thermodynamics, thermophysics, chemistry and chemical engineering, including theoretical interpretation and error propagation analysis are required. Specialized skills include demonstrated familiarity with the TRC data systems and, in particular, TRC SOURCE data system. SOURCE data system is a major relational archival system developed and maintained by the Thermodynamics Research Center of the Physical and Chemical Properties Division to store ‘raw’ experimental data for thermophysical, thermochemical and transport properties of pure compounds, binary and ternary systems as well as chemical reactions. SOURCE data system is also a powerful tool to produce various compilations and critical evaluations of data in both hard-copy and electronic forms. This work targets further enhancement of NIST/TRC SOURCE database, which serves as the foundation for ThermoData Engine (TDE) software developed by Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology implementing the concept of dynamic data evaluation to provide on-demand recommended thermophysical and thermochemical property data for binary mixtures.  Dr. Abdulagatov has numerous publications (>100) in the fields of thermodynamics with the highest importance to the projects of NIST/TRC.  He is an internationally recognized expert and has more than 20 years of experience in the measurement and interpretation of thermophysical and transport properties. His direct experimental experience includes measurement and interpretation of heat capacities, volumetric properties, phase equilibria, viscosities, thermal conductivities, surface tensions, and critical phenomena, which are core to the development of algorithms for assessment of uncertainties for these key properties. He has direct hands-on knowledge of NIST/TRC software tools, databases, and operations. His extensive experimental research experience makes him particularly well qualified to interpret and provide expertise in the critical evaluation of the published experimental thermodynamic data that is at the core of this project. It is certain that Dr. Abdulagatov has a unique combination of skills and experience necessary to provide the solutions for all the tasks related to the proposed work.  This notice is for information purposes only. No formal solicitation will be issued.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.

Product Information
The Profile XT
The Profile XT™ is a "Total person" assessment that has a myriad of uses. It measures the job-related qualities that make a person productive - Thinking and Reasoning Style, Behavioral Traits, and Occupational Interests. It is convenient and easy to use on the Internet - no administrator or proctoring is required. 
The Profile XT is used for placement, promotion, self-improvement, coaching, succession planning, and job description development. Our clients tell us The Profile XT is three to five times more effective than any other assessment they have used. It is a versatile management tool that develops Job Match Patterns that can be customized by company, department, manager, position, geography, or any combination of these factors.

Job Match Patterns Make the Difference
Job Match Patterns are effective because they compare the qualities of your job candidates to the attributes of your most productive employees. The patterns tell you whether candidates are like or different from your top performers. A study published in the Harvard Business Review concluded that Job Match more accurately predicts job success than any of the commonly accepted factors, such as education, experience, or job training. Matching people so they fit the work they do builds productivity and job-satisfaction and diminish negative factors such as stress, tension, conflict, miscommunication, and costly employee turnover. 

The Profile XT produces these reports: 
&#61553;	Individual Reports - An Individual Report is used for personal growth and development. It describes a person’s attributes and gives insights to improve job performance and productivity.
&#61553;	Placement Reports - A Placement Report is used to put the right person in the right job. It gives employers assessments of job candidates’ thinking style, behavioral traits, and occupational interests, giving the candidate’s percentage match to the company’s top performers. The report also suggests questions interviewers can ask to help determine a candidate’s suitability for the position being filled.
&#61553;	Succession Planning Report - The Succession Planning Report lets you look into the future. It compares a person to all of the jobs in your company and indicates those where they have a good job match. With this information, you can help employees prepare for greater responsibilities by making sure they acquire the skills and experiences they will need in order to perform competently the jobs they will fill in coming years.
&#61553;	Candidate Matching Report - The Candidate Matching Report is helpful for narrowing your search as you seek to fill a position. It compares the attributes of several candidates to your Job Match Pattern and, at a glance, shows you which of them have the highest Job Match Percentage. Then, by closer examination of the top candidates’ Placement Reports, you can easily determine which of them you want to interview and graduate to the next steps in your hiring process.
&#61553;	Coaching Reports - Coaching reports are a manager’s guide to helping the people they manage develop better work habits. The report has suggestions for improving employee performance so it approaches the productivity of the company’s top performers. Using the reports to direct the development of employees enables managers to develop their leadership abilities.
&#61553;	Job Analysis Reports - The Job Analysis Report describes in great detail, the type of person who has the right qualities and characteristics to fit a particular job. This report complements a standard job description that details the skills and duties the job requires. Used together, they contain a Total person approach to explaining the requirements of a particular position.
&#61553;	Summary Reports - They give you a "snapshot" of essential information about employees and job candidates.
&#61553;	Graph Reports - A visual representation of Job Match data.

Easy to Use
The Profile XT is conveniently administered on the Internet, so you can assess employees and job candidates anywhere there is Internet access. Other administration options are available on request. Results are available immediately and can be shared with decision makers in any of your company's offices, anywhere in the world. You can retrieve any or all of the variety of Profile XT reports at no additional cost. Results are immediate thanks to computer technology and you get your requested reports in minutes.
The Profile XT satisfies all requirements of the EEOC, the ADA, the DOL, and the Civil Rights Act. It was designed and developed to be specifically job-related and has been validated in accordance with American Psychological Association standards.

•	Checkpoint 360	
The Profiles Checkpoint 360 Competency Feedback System is a multi-rater feedback process that provides managers and leaders with an opportunity to receive an evaluation of their job performance from the people around them – their boss, their peers, and the people whose work they supervise. From this feedback, managers can compare the opinions of others with their own perceptions, positively identify their strengths, and pinpoint the areas of their job performance that could be improved.
This assessment process is concerned with a manager’s job performance in eight skill clusters and 18 universal competencies, described as follows: 

Communication 
Listens to others 
Processes information 
Communicates effectively	Leadership 
Instills trust 
Provides direction 
Delegates responsibility
Adaptability 
Adjusts to circumstances 
Thinks creatively	Relationships 
Builds personal relationships 
Facilitates team success
Task Management 
Works efficiently 
Works competently	Production 
Takes action 
Achieves results
Development of Others 
Cultivates individual talents 
Motivates successfully	Personal Development 
Displays commitment 
Seeks improvement

The Process
Each participant completes an evaluation, a process that takes about 30 minutes. They are guaranteed anonymity (except for the “Boss”) and urged to be honest and objective in their responses. Participants may complete their assignments via the Internet and results from all participants are compiled in a report that is returned to the manager. 

Full Color Report
Checkpoint Reports have colorful graphs and charts as well as narrative descriptions of the results to help the manager read, understand, and effectively use the data for self-development. The report has a special personal growth section that coaches the manager and helps improve performance in development areas. 
The Checkpoint 360 Competency Feedback System is an effective managerial development system that pays big dividends in improved performance.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is set aside for small business.  The NAICS code is 541820 with a small business size standard of $6,000,000 in annual sales.  The due date for proposals is Wednesday, August 24, 2005 at 2:00 p.m. local time.  Proposals shall be submitted electronically to keanna.maxwell@ed.gov.  The U.S. Department of Education is requesting proposals in order to award a purchase order to obtain services of a contractor to provide speechwriting, speech editing and speech coaching services.  The U.S. Secretary of Education and other key Departmental officials give many speeches on education issues to inform the public, state and local officials, education officials, parents, teachers, businesses, and a wide variety of groups about vital education issues.  ED requires the services of a contractor to supplement its in-house work.  Work will be performed by the contractor on an individual task basis, at the request of ED, when such services are needed.   It is critical that effective speeches are given to convey the information about education issues.  The contractor shall be required to perform the following activities:  prepare and edit for content and substance, speeches for the Secretary of Education and senior staff on education issues.  Emphasis is on structure, content, and cohesive articulation of the issues.  Bullets on the event, including the topic of the speech and audience makeup will be provided to the contractor by ED generally 12 days in advance of the event.  Contractor will have five days to provide first draft of speech to ED if contractor is writing speech in its entirety.  Second and final drafts will be provided back to ED within 24 hours after receiving edits.  When the task consists of editing rather than drafting the full speech, ED will provide the draft to the contractor generally nine days in advance of the event.  The contractor will have 2 days to provide ED the completed speech.  ED will provide background material, including identification of the type of audience.  Contractor shall produce a finished product tailored to reach the specific audience with clarity.  The speech will contain a clear, coherent, and compelling message designed to capture and maintain the audience’s attention.  All drafts and final product will be double-spaced and provided in both electronic format and hardcopy (two copies).   Contractor shall provide speech coaching to the Secretary and other senior staff to improve the delivery and the reception of the speech.  This includes practice runs of the speeches with the speaker to increase comfort and effectiveness of the delivery, and individual instruction to match and hone the presenter’s style.  Contractor’s experience with teleprompters will be used in coaching sessions to enhance the speakers’ working knowledge of teleprompters and ease of use.  Contractor must apply knowledge of script formatting for teleprompters, and will be responsible for performing this function for ED speakers.   The period of performance for the resulting service agreement is for twelve months.   It is anticipated that a purchase order will be issued within the simplified acquisition threshold.   This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-03.   FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and no addenda are included to the clause.  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  Evaluation will be made on a best value basis where technical merit is more important than price.  Technical merit will be determined on the basis of the following:  1. The demonstrated knowledge and experience of proposed staff in regards to the U.S. Department of Education and its mission, including No Child Left Behind and other current education issues, and the ability to quickly research such issues;  2.  The demonstrated experience in providing speech-writing services for nationally known speakers at the Cabinet level in federal government or equivalent in the private sector; and 3.  The demonstrated experience in providing speech-coaching services for nationally known speakers at the Cabinet level in federal government or equivalent in the private sector.  Offerors shall propose hourly rates for each of the following services:  speechwriting, speech editing, and speech coaching.  The price evaluation will consist of a comparison of the prices proposed.  The best value determination will consist of a paired comparison of proposals received comparing technical merit and the proposed price to determine the greatest value to the Government.

All responsible sources may submit a quotation that, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.  Contact person:  Keanna Maxwell at 202-245-6137; email: keanna.maxwell@ed.gov.  Quotations should be emailed to Keanna Maxwell, or faxed to her at (202) 245-6297.  Please cite reference number EDOOOS-05-000098 in the quotation.  Quotations must be received by August 24, 2005.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  “Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group, which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the lease of a commercially available Clarient (formerly ChromaVision )ACIS Model Number IIC, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, No. RFQ-NCI-50107-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 1005-05.  The acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items authorized in FAR 13.6.

The North American Industry Classification code is 532490, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.

Background:  The Carcinogen-DNA Interactions (CDI) section requires an imaging system that allows us to quantitatively analyze immunohistochemical staining in various organelles to correlate human carcinogen exposure with cancer risk. We have been notified by Clarient (formerly ChromaVision) that they will no longer provide a service contract or repair service for our existing ChromaVision ACIS I system. The company claims that the system is too old to support, and that parts are not available to repair the instrument. This means that if the instrument breaks down we will loose all of our existing applications as well as access to our current data files. This will result in the loss of data for 2 currently-ongoing studies involving hundreds of human samples.

Features of ACIS IIC:  

1)	Processing of up to 100 slides barcode linked to applications

2)	Auto-calibration with printed report;  

3)	A  color-space transformation which uses a three-dimensional plot of color coordinates, including hue, luminosity, and saturation (HLS);

4) 	The collection of object data including nuclear counts and analysis according to the user- defined shape and diameter of the nuclei displaying staining within a user-defined range of hue;

5) 	Reporting of numerical average intensity of staining per nucleus for a user-defined region within user-defined ranges of HLS as well as the counting of stained cells within the defined HLS;

CLIN 0004 DELIVERY OF WINDTUNNEL
The contractor shall deliver the wind tunnel to the installation site at Cal Poly Pomona, Pomona, CA.

CLIN 0005 INSTALLATION OF WINDTUNNEL
The contractor shall install a Northrop Grumman (NG)-designed model support system onto the new wind tunnel.  The model support system, shown at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/ , will be constructed under a separate contract and provided to the wind tunnel contractor for installation. The contractor shall mount the model support hardware below the test section.  This system includes a strut that extends up into the test section for mounting test models.  It provides pitch and yaw control of the model.  An Interface Control Drawing (ICD) is provided at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/.  It shows the model support hardware installation under the wind tunnel test section.  A NG-designed slotted turntable (45 inch diameter, 1/4 inch thick aluminum disk) will be installed into a circular cutout in the floor of the new test section, flush with the tunnel’s floor surface.  The disk turns with the support system for yaw control.  The strut extends through the slotted disk and pivots to give pitch control.  The support system must be positioned and leveled (with respect to the tunnel centerline when installed) so that the center of rotation of the support system coincides with the center of the test section.

The contractor shall install a base to locate the support system vertically.  The base will be attached to the floor below the test section and the support system will be mounted on top of three adjustable leveling feet.  Dimensions of the base are approximately 38 inches wide by 55 inches long by 12 inches high. (The height of the base is dependent upon the distance from the floor to the test section centerline.)  An existing base design is available from NG and will be modified  and constructed by another vendor and supplied to the wind tunnel vendor for installation under the test section.

CLIN 0006 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TRAINING SESSION
The contractor shall perform functional tests of the new wind tunnel to verify that all specifications are met and make all adjustments or corrections, as required to achieve operation and test section airflow quality within the specification.  Any negative deviation from the specifications must be approved by the AF. To verify the flow quality, the contractor shall perform a detailed calibration of the airflow in the test section of the installed wind tunnel.  This would include two-dimensional mappings (every 2 inches in the y and z directions normal to the flow direction) of flow velocity, flow angularity in pitch and yaw, and turbulence intensity at 3 (streamwise) stations along the test section: the center of the test section and two other longitudinal stations +/-20 inches from the first.

The contractor shall provide a training session for the AF and CPP personnel.  Topics include facility operation, maintenance, servicing, precautions, etc.
