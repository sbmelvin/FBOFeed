<DESC>Commercial Travel Office for Official Travel at Hanscom AFB, MA: Operational Contracting plans to issue a solicitation on the Hanscom Electronic RFP Bulletin Board (HERBB) (http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil) on a future date to acquire a contract for the Commercial Travel Office (CTO) for Official travel at Hanscom AFB, MA. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The North American Industries Classification System (NAICS) code will be 561510  - Travel Agencies.  This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in acting as agents in selling travel, tour, and accommodation services to the general public and commercial clients.  The small business size standard is $1,000,000 annually in average gross revenue taken for the last three fiscal years.  For NAIC 561510, gross revenue excludes funds received in trust for an unaffiliated third party, such as bookings or sales subject to commissions.  The commissions themselves are included as revenue.  The solicitation and resultant contract are designed to provide interim official travel services until the establishment of the Defense Travel System  (DTS) (anticipated DTS for Hanscom is August 2003).  If DTS is implemented on or before August 2003, the CTO contract will be terminated with 60 days notification, at no penalty or termination cost to the Government.  <br><br>Award will be made on or about 1 June 2002.  The period of performance for the CTO contract is for 3 Years (One Year Base Period, including a 30 day orientation period, and 2, 1-year  Options).  The period of performance for the Base Year will be approximately 1 June 2002 through 31 May 2003 depending on award date.  This includes the 30 day orientation period which will run from 1 June 2002 through 30 June 2002.   The current contractor, The Travel Company, will permit the incoming contractor access to the on-site facilities during the 30-day orientation period for the purpose of learning the requirements and processes of the Hanscom travel office.  The incoming contractor will receive no compensation during this 30-day orientation period.  <br><br>The prospective Contractor shall take over all travel office requirements by the completion of this orientation.   Option 1 will be from approximately 1 June 2003 through 31 May 2004 and Option 2 will be from approximately 1 June 2004 through 31 May 2005.  The prospective contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to perform the management and operation of official travel services. The prospective Contractor shall be primarily engaged in furnishing travel information and acting as agents in arranging travel in support of official government travel requirements.  These services shall include making airline travel reservations, car rental and lodging reservations, and ticketing and billing.  Hanscom AFB has an annual dollar volume of approximately $4.8 million for official travel.  This amount is based on the most recent annual breakout: Approximately 15,300 official airline travel tickets were issued consisting of 900 international tickets for approximately $800,000 and 14,400 domestic tickets totaling approximately $4.0 million, 9,300 rental cars for approximately $1.2 million and 1,000 refunds totaling approximately $313,000.  Please note the Government neither warrants nor guarantees any specific volume of travel services; actual workload may fluctuate substantially.  The successful contractor will be reimbursed under this contract by a combination of a transaction fee paid by each traveler&#8217;s office and all commissions paid by the airlines, car rental businesses, the accommodation sector, and other travel organizations.  The CTO solicitation will ask prospective offerors to provide an Official Travel Transaction Fee based on the following: <br><br> 1)	The Contractor shall make confirmed reservations for all modes of transportation as requested.  A non-refundable transaction feewill be charged for each reservation booked and ticketed.  A "reservation" can consist of airline reservations, hotel reservations, car reservations or rail reservations as well as any combination thereof.  The fee is charged only one time per transaction no matter how many components may be included.  The transaction fee will be assessed only one time per transaction whether or not changes are made to the reservation.   <br><br> The following are some of the travel services qualifications that will be important in selecting the successful contractor; Compliance with travel policies, (GSA mandatory programs, e.g. Contract Airline City-Pair), Customer Service, On-Site and/or Off-Site Service, Hours of Operation, Emergency Services, Billing and Payment Procedures, Services related to Making and Booking Reservations, Quality Control Procedures, and Ticketing (e-tickets and/or hard-copies).  This is a best value acquisition and will be awarded to that contractor who offers the Government the best overall value based on a combination of price, technical ability and past performance.  Contractors that are interested and capable of providing these services should respond to this notice via e-mail, with a brief resume and any other information they deem appropriate within 15 days of this publication, to the following address: Amy.Sirois@hanscom.af.mil.  No telephone inquiries to this notice will be considered.  <br><br>This solicitation will be issued using commercial practices in accordance with FAR Part 12.  All respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in order to receive an award.  Applications for CCR registration may be obtained at: www.ccr2000.com/. Acknowledgment of responses to this notice will not be issued.  However, respondents will be notified when the CTO solicitation is posted on HERBB.
