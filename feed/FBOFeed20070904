This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the maintenance of BlueCoat Appliances and software support.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the BlueCoat product as a key component of the Department’s core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet.  The maintenance listed above is required to support the Department’s mission critical operating environment and its data from harmful attacks and viruses.  The BlueCoat software aids in the process of content filtering for unauthorized sites as well as filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the Department of State’s mission critical operating environment. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s core firewall infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  This project will be funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), DHHS, in conjunction with the NIAID, NIH.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for the development of a prophylactic multivalent filovirus vaccine that is capable of protecting against both Ebola and Marburg viruses, utilizing platform technology such that the same basic development and manufacturing process is used to develop each component of the final multivalent vaccine.  NOTE 1:  This solicitation will NOT support the development of devices for the delivery of vaccines; the development of therapeutic agents and therapeutic vaccines; the development of new animal models or refinement of existing animal models; the design and conduct of Phase 3 clinical trials; nor the development of any adjuvants which are not currently used in FDA-licensed vaccines.  NOTE 2:  BSL-4 facilities for animal model development, animal model vaccine efficacy testing, and assay development are to be proposed by the offeror(s). However, the Government retains the right to negotiate the most effective and efficient mechanisms for providing such facilities.  This solicitation seeks to fund organizations with demonstrated vaccine product development experience to advance development of a prophylactic candidate multivalent filovirus vaccine that protects against both Ebola and Marburg viruses.  For the purposes of this solicitation, candidate vaccines need not have been tested in a multivalent manner nor have shown protection against all desired strains of Ebola and Marburg.  Candidate vaccines eligible for support must have two characteristics:  First, a candidate vaccine must utilize a platform technology such that the same basic development and manufacturing process can be used to develop each component of the final multivalent vaccine; and Second, the proposed platform technology must have been used successfully to demonstrate the efficacy of the vaccine candidate in non-human primate (NHP) Ebola and Marburg challenge models.  It is sufficient for the platform technology to have demonstrated protection in a monovalent vaccination/challenge study design, that is, a monovalent Marburg vaccine tested in the Marburg NHP challenge model and a monovalent Ebola vaccine tested in the Ebola NHP challenge model.  The target multivalent vaccine must contain/express antigens of SEBOV, ZEBOV, ICEBOV, RAVN, and either Ci67, Musoke, or another closely related strain of Marburg, and must provide for a relatively rapid onset of protection following no more than two doses, post-exposure prophylaxis will also be considered.  Protection is defined as proof of concept efficacy (greater than 80% survival) in the NHP challenge model (i.m. route of infection with greater than or equal to 100 pfu of challenge virus).  Offerors must propose a well-defined and feasible Product Development Plan for advancing the vaccine candidate by carrying out the following research and development activities as specified in the negotiated Statement of Work:  1) development and update of the Product Development Plan for a multivalent filovirus vaccine candidate, including regulatory, clinical, non-clinical, and manufacturing activities to be undertaken; 2) manufacturing and formulation process development; 3) manufacturing of pilot lot cGMP material; 4) real time and accelerated vaccine stability studies; 5) conduct of non-clinical studies, including all Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies and multivalent immunogenicity interference studies; 6) development, qualification and, where necessary, validation of all assays and reagents necessary to support product development; 7) development, submission, and sponsorship of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, including compliance with all regulatory requirements; 8) design, conduct, completion, and analysis of a Phase 1 dose-escalating clinical trial of the multivalent vaccine candidate in healthy subjects ages 18 to 40; 9) the provision of clinical and non-clinical samples from all studies to NIAID and, for clinical trials, obtaining future use consent from volunteers for their samples; and 10) the provision to NIAID of cGMP final container vaccine and all necessary supporting documentation/letters of cross-reference to allow NIAID to perform subsequent clinical trials.  OPTIONS:  Contracts awarded under this Broad Agency Announcement will include three Options that may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  Options 1 and 2 may be undertaken concurrently. However, Option 3 may not be undertaken until successful completion of the tasks described in Option 1 as determined by the Government.  Option 1 provides for performance of all activities associated with the transfer and scale-up from pilot scale to large-scale cGMP manufacturing and release of 200,000 doses minimum target scale of the candidate vaccine for use in further clinical trials.  Option 2 provides for the conduct of studies to develop a lyophilized final container formulation to improve vaccine shelf-life and stability.  Option 3 provides for the design, conduct, completion, and analysis of a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate further the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate multivalent vaccine.  It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded.  Funding will be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for the BASE period will be five years beginning on or about September 20, 2008, with Options to be exercised at the Government?s discretion for a maximum period of performance of 9 years.  It is anticipated that each OPTION will cover a period of two years.  Options 1 and 2 may be undertaken concurrently.  However, Option 3 may not be undertaken until successful completion of Option 1, as determined by the Government.  It is estimated that the provision of total FTEs will be as follows:  Base Period:  13.85 total FTEs for a 5-year period; Option 1:  3.75 total FTEs for a 2-year period; Option 2:  4.65 total FTEs for a 2-year period; and Option 3:  9.1 total FTEs for a 2-year period.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This Broad Agency Announcement will be available electronically on/about September 18, 2007, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 with Raytheon Company, 1801 W Hughes Drive, Fullerton CA 92833-2200 for the purchase of two (2) MicroLight Receiver Transmitters; two (2) MicroLight Antennas; and two (2) Cable Assemblies. Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334220.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION: 

AFRL requires these items for the AFRL project entitled N-CET to seamlessly integrate multiple N-CET pods together. N-CET requires that multiple radio back-ends be used to integrate pods together and connect pods to other systems already using certain radios. The project identified the Micro-Light radio as one such radio to be used because of its unique features. A failure to use the MicroLight radio will result in a general failure of this objective. Similar recent procurements have established an inventory that this requirement will augment. The radio is only manufactured and distributed by Raytheon.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<CONTACT>Stacy Figlinski 850-235-5842 , or Contracting Officer Wanda Cutchin at 850-636-6140.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a five-year follow-on Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to EDO Corporation, 511 Skyview Drive, Panama City, Florida 32408-7608.  This IDIQ contract includes a variety of engineering services for the repair and conversion of the MK 105, Organic Airborne and Surface Influence Sweep (OASIS), the Precise Navigation System (PNS), and the Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS 53).  The use of task orders will provide the flexibility necessary for the different types of work required.  Under this, IDIQ EDO will provide for repair, modification and overhaul of the MK 105, OASIS and PNS systems.  This includes all depot repairs and incorporation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), including the generation of all Integrated Logistics Support documentation to support the conversions.  This effort is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following !  reasons.   a)  EDO is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the only source for the three systems listed above.  As such, only EDO has the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel to successfully complete the system overhauls and supporting documentation as well as the other tasking specified above.  EDO has been the sole developer of the OASIS system including the award of the Systems Design and Development (SD&D) Contract (Contract No. N00024-02-C-6316 in fiscal year 2002)  There have been no other contractual actions related to the direct development of the OASIS system since award of this contract.  EDO is the Depot facility for the above Airborne Mine Counter Measures (AMCM) systems.  By PMS-495 direction, EDO is the Software Support Activity and the Drawing Configuration Manager for the MK 105, OASIS, and Precise Navigation systems.  The Government views all software and drawing changes, but the software and drawings reside at EDO under !  Contractor control.   b)  Given the complexity of the MK-105, OASIS, P NS, and AMNS systems and the level of system knowledge required overhauling and repairing this complex equipment and systems, EDO is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking.  c)  This is a follow-on to contract N61331-06-D-0019 for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. In summary, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.  Note 22 applies.  NAICS Code:  334511, FSC Code !  J020, SBA Size Standard is 750 employees.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC)  intends to issue a sole source contract to Omni Technologies Incorporated (OTI), Building 9115, Stennis Space Center, MS 39529-0001, for the acquisition of fourteen (14) upgrade kits for the AN/SQH-4 Bottom Sediment Classifier (BSC).  Each upgrade kit will consist of the Interface Chassis, the UQN-4A Signal Tap Board, and the PCI Controller.   This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  OTI developed both the software and the hardware for the BSC system. The hardware consists of a unique PCI Controller Card which will reside within one of the NAVC2 servers, an electronics box which mounts to the bulkhead in the chartroom and a circuit card which mounts inside of the UQN-4A system, all onboard the MCM Class of ship.  These parts have been developed as a prototype installation set and preliminary drawings exist, however a complete technical data package is not available and will not be available unti!  l the system has undergone qualification testing in fiscal year 2008. As a result, the Government does not have a technical data package that is suitable to merit competition.  This is a rapid development and implementation program that requires me to have this installed on the first of 14 ships beginning in January 2008.  OTI as the original equipment developer and manufacturer of this upgrade equipment is the only supplier at this time.  This is a one time buy to acquire all required shipsets.   Delivery will be to the NSWC PC.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for spacecraft deployment and launch vehicle integration support. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center is proposing to purchase a Poly Picosatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD). In order to accomplish CubeSail Mission level activities, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center intends to build and fly a 3U CubeSat called the CubeSail, on a USAF-STP Minotaur IV launch that is tentatively schedule for the third quarter of FY09.  The work for this contract will be broken down into two Phases. Phase I will include P-POD manufacturing, qualification testing, and CubeSail support. Phase II will include pursuing launch opportunities for CubeSail, launch services, and launch support. All of Phase I and some of Phase II costs are covered by this contract.   NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from The University of California Polytechnic.  Competition is impratical because CalPoly is the original developer and is the only source available for the P-POD ejector. There is no other device capable of providing the mechanical interface between the 3U pico-satellite-based CubeSail and standard Launch Vehicle that is compatible with the cubesat specifications.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, September 11, 2007.

<DESC>On April 18, 2003, the staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) forwarded to the Commission SECY-03-0059, "NRC's Advanced Reactor Research Program."  This document provided the staff's assessment of NRC's advanced reactor technical infrastructure development and safety research that would be needed to support the review of new and advanced reactor applications planned and envisioned at that time.  A new draft was created recently "Advanced Reactor Research Program" (Agency-wide Documents Access and Management System, ADAMS, ML070740637) which identified several research tasks under the thermal-fluids and accident analysis technical areas; the first of which is the completion of R&D phenomena tables for a generic high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) design.  This involved an assessment of the current knowledge base associated with the identified phenomena to aid in developing analytical tools and technical bases to perform safety analyses and regulatory reviews, and the scope of technology development needs to support HTGR licensing, including both air-cooled and water cooled reactor cavity cooling systems (RCCSs).  

Under this requirement, the contractor shall capture all contributing heat transfer mechanisms that impact the heat rejection capacity of the RCCS: radiation, convection, and conduction for both the air-cooled and water-cooled designs.  The selected tools have to be consistent with the large scale of and RCCS, as well as the operating regimes expected during normal and accident conditions.  Simulations shall account for changes in the heat rejection capability of the RCCS induced by heterogeneous boundary conditions, e.g., coolant mass flow rate and temperature distribution at the inlet, vessel heat flux discontinuities, flow obstructions, and emissivity variations.  Special attention shall be given to the influence of dust on local heat transfer phenomena.

It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. 

The period of performance of the resultant contract will be eighteen (18) months. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about June 1, 2007 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. 

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. 

The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $4.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541330.  

Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

The rentable area must yield 6,972 ANSI BOMA office area square feet.  The space will be occupied by the Census Bureau for operations associated with the 2010 Census enumeration.  The Census Bureau intends to occupy the built-out space by September 2, 2008.  The Lessor will be required to fund the tenant improvement costs and amortize the cost over the term of the lease.   

LEASE TERM:  Two (2) years and three (3) months fully serviced with cancellation rights after twenty-three (23) months.

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS: The Government prefers that the space be contiguous and located on one floor.  If the offered space is located on two floors, the upper floor must be contiguous and configured in such a way that it is stacked directly above the adjoining space on the lower floor. Space cannot be located on more than two floors or be non-contiguous.   If the space is located in a building with two or more stories, the Government requires that the building provide at least one elevator, which must be a handicap accessible public elevator with freight capability.

The following space configurations will not be considered: space split by a public corridor; space with atriums or other areas interrupting contiguous space; extremely long or narrow runs of space; irregularly shaped space configurations or other unusual building features adversely affecting usage.  Space shall be located in a commercially zoned area and shall not be located near railroad tracks or other land uses that negatively impact normal business operations.  Space shall not be located within a flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.  Space should not be 1) located in a building housing federal, state, or local law enforcement, tax authorities, courts and associated court-related services,  immigration services, or social service agencies; 2) located in a building housing a US Department of Homeland Security agency; or 3)  located in a building housing drug treatment or prisoner detention. The agency shall have access to its space 24 hours a day, 7 days per week. The Government requires a fully serviced lease including the provision of possible overtime utility service with the number of hours required to be established  by the Government. The Government requires a loading dock (or acceptable alternative such as a scissor lift) and adequate maneuvering room for ongoing truck deliveries.  The Government requires a total of three (3) parking spaces in close proximity of the space for employees included as part of the lease.  In addition, there must be at least fifty (50) parking spaces available for free, fee or lease within three (3) blocks of the building with handicap parking availability.  Parking spaces in commercial lots shall be available throughout the day, and be within commercial rates.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis in accordance with 13.106-(b)(1), services from Dr. Dawn Provenzale, 508 Fulton Street, Durham, North Carolina 27705 for services regarding the Cancer Care Quality Measurement System (CCQMS).  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541690 and the business size standard is $6.5M. 
The projects specific objectives are to use the Veterans Health Administrations existing colorectal cancer care electronic quality measurement system tool. The CCQMS is a quality measurement tool that measures cancer care according to the NCCN Guidelines.  The tool measures aspects of care including appropriate staging procedures for patients with colorectal cancer, types of surgery and their appropriateness, intervals from diagnosis to surgery, types of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and the intervals from diagnosis to the receipt of these interventions.  Contractor shall: 1) Use established National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical guidelines and the benchmarks for the standard of care in order to develop and refine a quality measurement system that will: a) describe the care processes and procedures of colorectal cancer patients; b) identify facility level gaps in care to patients; c) identify facility level deviations from established standards of patient care; d) identify facility level variations in patient-centered outcomes including satisfaction with care, and quality of cancer communication and decision-making; e) assess responsiveness to patient-centered needs, preferences, and outcomes; f) identify system wide gaps in care to patients and; g) identify system wide deviations from established standards of patient care.  In addition to the above: 2) Provide feedback to participating facilities; 3)  Create CCQMS reports for initial and continuous monitoring and evaluation of cancer care and; 4) Establish requirements for updating and maintaining the CCQMS and requirements for transferring and implementing CCQMS in other health care systems.
NCI will benefit from this procurement by acquiring a medical abstraction tool (CQMS) that may be useful for agencies other than the Veterans Administration (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) to use, as well as a tool that may be used in health services research by internal researchers or grantees.

Dr. Provenzale is uniquely qualified to provide the services necessary regarding the work in quality measurement to the Department of Defense through her current proposal Cancer Care Quality Measurement System that is being submitted to the NCIs Quality of Cancer Care Committee (QCCC).  She is the principal investigator of the Colorectal Cancer Care Quality Measurement System (CCQMS) Development project in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).    The tool has been created by Dr. Provenzale for use in the VHA population.  It is currently being piloted at 31 VA Medical Centers throughout the country.  Currently, individuals at the 31 sites are abstracting information on the types of care received by their colorectal cancer patients.  Dr. Provenzale has had extensive experience in initiating and conducting multi-center studies of quality measurement and in the use of electronic medical records for research.  She is the only VA investigator that has VHA Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to access electronic medical records for the purpose of developing and testing the Colorectal Cancer Care Quality Measurement System.  She is the VHA Principal Investigator for the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/VHA collaborative Cancer Care Outcome Research and Surveillance (CanCORS), in which she is collecting data from 14 VHA sites to measure longitudinal outcomes and quality of colorectal cancer care. Dr.Provenzale is the only VHA member of the CanCORS Steering Committee.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

DS has selected Dell servers as the standard server platform for the entire Bureau of Diplomatic Security IT enterprise. Please note that these are NOT personal computers, these are major infrastructure appliances used throughout the Bureau’s enterprise and located at different buildings across the United States.  The use of name brand is essential to the Government’s requirements for Department of State DS server consolidation and standardization.    This selection was approved by the DS ITCCB as required by 5 FAM 862.1(b).  By standardizing on Dell servers, DS has realized approximately a 20% savings in the form of Dell Systems Management (central management of enterprise Dell servers and storage devices), component commonality (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), maintenance and warranty costs, support personnel skill sets requirements and investment protection.  NOTE:  Any hardware vendor chosen other than Dell would require additional server monitoring software and hardware as DS currently only has the means to monitor and administer (from a lights out perspective) is the Dell DRAC enabled hardware; additional maintenance agreements; additional skill sets (personnel) and additional spare parts.   The Bureau of Diplomatic Security for the Department of State has a requirement for additional Dell 2950 and 1950 servers to further consolidate and standardize the enterprise.  The Dell servers are all being purchased with the same baseline configuration.  This configuration will support all known and foreseen needs in the enterprise, including web, Oracle, Exchange, Terminal, Print, and Blackberry servers.  These additional servers will be in addition to the servers that have already been purchased for the existing enterprise.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement.DS identified multiple vendors for the Dell 2950 and 1950 Servers to seek best value pricing. Dell manufacturing provides compatibility and availability of the units, essential to meet the Agency’s requirements.  It is important to note that any vendor who sells Dell servers can provide these products.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This notice is to update the status of the CFT source selection as of  Sep 4, 2007.  We have received word that SAF/AQ should be providing a signed copy of the approved Acquisition Plan in the next day or two.  The Acquisition Plan outlines the overarching approach the team has proposed for the upcoming set of CFT contracts.
Part of the overall strategy is to delegate Source Selection Authority to AFMC.

Once the Acq. Plan has been approved, AFMC can then review and approve the Source Selection Plan.  The SSP is the document that outlines the exact process which will be used to evaluate and select which offerors will receive basic contract awards.

We are "hopeful" and cautiously optimistic these documents will both be signed sometime this week.  Once that has occurred, we will be able to release the formal RFP.  An exact date for the RFP release cannot be predicted.  Our internal timeline is to accomplish this no later than 14 Sep 2007, but it could happen earlier.....and it could happen later.

All interested parties are encouraged to watch WWW.FBO.GOV daily for any updates or an actual RFP release.

Everyone's continued patience and interest in the program is appreciated.

<DESC>Subject: Metals
Proposed Solicitation Number: FA8224-07-R-1000.                   
NOTE:  PREVIOUS SYNOPSIS AND PROGRAM INFORMATION HAS BEEN POSTED TO FBO UNDER REFERENCE NUMBER FA8224-07-R-METL.                       
Opening/Closing Date:  The RFP should post between 15 and 30 days after this synopsis.       


Description: The Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) authorizes, orders, stocks and consumes a large volume of metals and plastics in support of depot maintenance activities, depot commodity production, and other base or tenant requirements.  Due to the multitude of vendors, purchasing systems, storage methods, and delivery systems in which this material is currently obtained, excessive delays are frequently experienced in the supply chain and have a negative impact on mission support at OO-ALC.  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide on-time delivery of metals and plastics to support mission requirements.  The solicitation contemplates the award of up to three contracts.  The government reserves the right to award more or less contracts if in the best interests of the government.  This solicitation will be a full and open competition.  The contract will contain firm-fixed price contract line items.  Any contracts resulting from this solicitation shall be evaluated using Price Performance Trade-off (PPT) source selection procedures set forth is AFFARs 5315.3.  The contract will be a Commercial Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, with a maximum for all contracts issued of $15 Million, which is also the program maximum.  The ordering period for the contracts will be a 5 years with an option to extend the term of the contract by 6 months.  Any synopses, RFPs, amendments, etc. will be provided through the GPE at http://www.fedbizopps.gov .  

SPECIAL NOTE:  This acquisition was previously synopsized as a 100 percent set-aside for small business.  However, due to the non-manufacturer rule found in FAR 19.102(f), it has been determined in coordination with SBA that small businesses cannot supply products of their own manufacture or that of another small business, therefore a set-aside is not appropriate.

<DESC>On April 18, 2003, the staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) forwarded to the Commission SECY-03-0059, "NRC's Advanced Reactor Research Program."  This document provided the staff's assessment of NRC's advanced reactor technical infrastructure development and safety research that would be needed to support the review of new and advanced reactor applications planned and envisioned at that time.  A new draft was created recently "Advanced Reactor Research Program" (Agency-wide Documents Access and Management System, ADAMS, ML070740637) which identified several research tasks under the thermal-fluids and accident analysis technical areas; the first of which is the completion of R&D phenomena tables for a generic high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) design.  This involved an assessment of the current knowledge base associated with the identified phenomena to aid in developing analytical tools and technical bases to perform safety analyses and regulatory reviews, and the scope of technology development needs to support HTGR licensing, including both air-cooled and water cooled reactor cavity cooling systems (RCCSs).  

Under this requirement, the contractor shall capture all contributing heat transfer mechanisms that impact the heat rejection capacity of the RCCS: radiation, convection, and conduction for both the air-cooled and water-cooled designs.  The selected tools have to be consistent with the large scale of and RCCS, as well as the operating regimes expected during normal and accident conditions.  Simulations shall account for changes in the heat rejection capability of the RCCS induced by heterogeneous boundary conditions, e.g., coolant mass flow rate and temperature distribution at the inlet, vessel heat flux discontinuities, flow obstructions, and emissivity variations.  Special attention shall be given to the influence of dust on local heat transfer phenomena.

It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. 

The period of performance of the resultant contract will be eighteen (18) months. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about June 1, 2007 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. 

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. 

The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $4.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541330.  

Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

<DESC>FTC Redress Services - Sources Sought Description: This announcement is not a request for proposal or quote and no award will be made from this announcement, it is a market research tool only.

The Federal Trade Commission is seeking vendor input on the following topics pertaining to the attached "Draft" RFP/SOW for Redress Services:

?Personal Identifying Information (PII) - how best to protect the exchange of consumers personal information between the contractor and the FTC, along with the contractor?s storage and protection of such information when received;

?Bonding and Insurance - how best to balance adequate coverage versus cost.  The FTC is seeking vendor comment on bonding and insurance scenarios up to and including 100% coverage.  Include in the commentary how costs would be accessed and allocated;

?Price Strategy - at which price points for claims administration and check distribution are economies of scale achieved, for example we currently employ a decreasing price per unit schedule  for Claims Notification, Claims Eligibility and Check Distribution using the following price points ? 1 to 9999; 10,0000 to 29,999; 30,000- 49,999; and, 50,000 and above.  Provide an opinion on this approach to pricing and any alternative pricing strategies; 

?Investment Alternatives - currently funds are invested in insured  money market accounts with FDIC insured banks until a check distribution in made.  We are seeking alternative options for maximizing interest income on deposits;

?Consumer Identification - what industry approaches can be taken to identify injured consumers when a claimant list is unavailable;

?Web-based Services - please advise if web-based services can be implemented by the contractor to efficiently and effectively enable interaction between the contractor and the FTC, and the contractor and consumers.  If web-based services can be implemented, please highlight the practicality and benefits of implementing such services;  

?Funds Distribution - in addition to disbursing funds to consumers by mailing checks, what other non-traditional methods are available or may be available within the next five years for funds distribution;

?Case Duration - assuming a claimant list is available when the Delivery Order is issued, what is the average duration of the life of a Delivery Order  assuming two rounds of check distributions?  What milestones must the FTC adhere to ensure the consumers receive a check distribution as early as possible? 

Feel free to offer best practices recommendations on any or all of the above.

<SOLNBR>W912DY-07-R-0054
<RESPDATE>091407
<ARCHDATE>11132007
<CONTACT>sarah.annerton, 256-895-1167
<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Medical Repair and Renewal (MRR) Program, A-E requirements.  The purpose of the MRR program is to support its various cus tomers throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions with their medical facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, addition, construction, equipment procurement/installation, and maintenance requirements.  In order to accomplish this objective, the MRR program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders may be issued for the provision of Ar chitect-Engineer (A-E) services.  The contracts will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  See numbered note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.   The North American Industrial Classific ation System code is 541330 and the size standard is $4,500,000.00.  The proposed contract ordering period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  The total requirements expected to be awarded under the MRR A-E contracts are anticip ated to equal approximately $15,000,000.  The Government will conduct two separate competitions for award of ID/IQ A-E contracts to support the MRR A-E requirements (one unrestricted and one restricted for competition amongst Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned  (SDVO) small businesses).  This public announcement is for the unrestricted competition and is intended to result in multiple awards (approximately 2).  Of the total $15,000,000 programmatic capacity, the total capacity of $10,000,000 is estimated for the  unrestricted MATOC pool which will be shared amongst the awardees in the MATOC pool.  The A-E Contractors and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for an MRR construction (with design-build capa bilities) contract (see W912DY-06-R-0028, W912DY-07-R-0030, and W912DY-07-R-0031).  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The highest ranked firm selected for negotiations will be  provided a Request for Price Proposal (RFPP).  If a mutually satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated, a RFPP package will be provided to the firm ranked next on the approved selection report.  This procedure would continue until all mutually satisfacto ry contract(s) have been negotiated and awarded.  Placement of task orders will be consistent with FAR subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services and subpart 16.5, Indefinite Delivery Contracts.  The Government will provide each awardee a fair opportunity t o be considered for each task order exceeding $3,000 issued under the multiple ID/IQ A-E contracts.  The Government will consider award of the A-E task order to the SDVO awardee prior to consideration of the unrestricted awardees.  If it is determined inap propriate to award the task order to the SDVO awardee, the Government will then consider the unrestricted awardees for the task order award.  If the Government has information available to ensure that each awardee is provided a fair opportunity to be consi dered for each order, the Government may not contact each of the multiple awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee.  When selecting an order awardee the Government will consider:  a.   Capability to perform the level of complexity requ ired for successful execution of the task;  b.   Past performance on earlier orders under the contract, including quality, timeliness and cost control; c.   Potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor; and d.   Minimum order requirements. Cost will not be an evaluation factor to be considered in selecting an order awardee.  Formal evaluation plans and scoring of quotes or offers will not be requi red.  The Government will give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for a delivery-order or task-order exceeding $3,000 unless an exemption provided in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  The Medical Repair and Renewal A-E contracts provide all services required to prepare plans, specifications, work plans and other supporting documents necessary for execution of the MRR projects issued by task order.  As part of the d esign effort the contractor may be required to survey the problem areas, evaluate and recommend solutions.  The level of detail and format of the design packages may vary dependent upon the complexity of the MRR project.  A complete design, including a bid  schedule, an order of work clause, a construction contractor submittal register, quantity and cost estimated, MCACES construction cost estimates, a proposed construction schedule, design analyses and calculations, a design document report, an engineering considerations and instructions report, and a draft operations and maintenance manual shall be developed for each project.  In addition to project designs the contractor may be required to conduct studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, eval uations, consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, value engineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, preparation of parametric estimate s, equipment and systems commissioning and other related services. Offerors must have specialized experience and technical competence in medical facility, equipment, and systems design.  In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Government may direct the A-E Contractor to perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contract.   SELECTION CRITERIA:  The selection criteria for the basic ID/IQ contracts are listed below and are equal in importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion).  Criteria a-e are primary.  Criteria f-g are secondary and will only be used a s tie-breakers among firms that are essentially technically equal.   a.  Specialized experience and technical competence in:  (1)  Recent experience (i.e. performed within the past three (3) years from the release of this announcement)  of the firm and its consultants in design of Medical facilities, Laboratories (research,  animal, clinical, Bio Safety Labs (BSL), dental clinics, medical clinics, support functions of medical facilities (power, water, steam), medical storage facilities, and medical transition spaces. (2)  Experience of the prime firm and significant subcontra ctors (i.e. any subcontract which equals 10% or more of the prime contract) in working together.  This experience should show successful completion of projects, on time, under budget and past project quality ratings.  (3)  Experience in adapting standard d esign packages.  The adaptations should demonstrate space conversions (warehouses to clinics for example), working with existing systems in renovating portions of hospitals.  (4) Rehabilitation of existing medical facilities of various types, sizes, and co mplexities.  (5)  Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria.  (6)  Design of projects on Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veteran Affairs, State Department, Department of Interior, Department of Energy, De partment of Transportation, and state and local government medical facilities.  (7)  Specific technical capabilities, such as construction cost estimating, scheduling, value engineering and materials testing.  The technical capabilities should demonstrate the type of equipment or software used and the need for subcontractors to perform these tasks.  (8) Knowledge of specific laws and regulations.  The contractor should demonstrate a working knowledge of JCAHO, Medical installa tion standards and local codes and regulations that govern medical facilities.  (9)  Compatibility with specific CAD equipment, and format of required CAD products. The contractor should demonstrate competency with Bentley Microstation CAD software, necess ary equipment to run software, USACE A/E/C CADD standards, production of PDF files for advertisement and the ability to convert CAD production source files into fully functional, error free files of AutoCAD and other required CAD products.(10)  Knowledge o f design criteria for medical facilities. This would include, but not limited to operating rooms, dental clinics, laboratories, occupational health clinics, and animal laboratories.  (11)  Design quality management approach.  Specifically, how will the con tractor maintain the quality of the design and cost control. What system is in place to assure the design quality is maintained?   b.  Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services.  The Government will conside r the qualifications, experience, and training of licensed, registered, and/or certified key personnel.  Resumes shall be provided in Section E for the following personnel:  architect, structural engineer, civil engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical en gineer, communications engineer, fire protection engineer, hazardous materials specialist, geotechnical engineer, land surveyor, industrial hygienist, safety engineer, interior designer, cost engineer, project manager, and landscape architect.  Also provid e the resume for a LEED Accredited Professional (AP), which can be one of the personnel listed above.  c.  Past performance on recent (i.e. performed within the past three (3) years from the release of this announcement) DoD and other contracts with respec t to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules, as determined from Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and other sources.  PPIRS will be queried for all prime firms.  Performance evaluations for any key subc ontractors will also be considered.  Any credible, information on past performance can be considered, but a board is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm if none is available from PPIRS.  d.  Capacity to accomplish the w ork in the required time.  The Government will consider the firms ability to make available an adequate number of interdisciplinary teams to accomplish at least five (5) task orders simultaneously.  e.  Capability to perform work throughout the Continenta l United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions.  Firms should demonstrate their capability to perform work in multiple geographic locations.  Greater consideration will be given to the A-E firms with the capabil ity to perform work in diverse locations rather than only having experience in one geographic area.   f.  Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minorit y institutions (MI) in the proposed contract team, measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU, or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner.  The greater the participat ion the greater the consideration. g.

<SUBJECT>C--Modification of Synopsis of Proposed Contract Action for Medical Repair and Renewal Program Architect Engineer Acquisition - SDVO Restricted Competition
<SOLNBR>W912DY-07-R-0055
<RESPDATE>091407
<ARCHDATE>11132007

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Medical Repair and Renewal (MRR) Program, A-E requirements.  The purpose of the MRR program is to support its various cus tomers throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions with their medical facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, addition, construction, equipment procurement/installation, and maintenance requirements.  In order to accomplish this objective, the MRR program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders may be issued for the provision of Ar chitect-Engineer (A-E) services.  The contracts will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  See numbered note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.   The North American Industrial Classific ation System code is 541330 and the size standard is $4,500,000.00.  The proposed contract ordering period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  The total requirements expected to be awarded under the MRR A-E contracts are anticip ated to equal approximately $15,000,000.  The Government will conduct two separate competitions for award of ID/IQ A-E contracts to support the MRR A-E requirements (one unrestricted and one restricted for competition amongst Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned  (SDVO) small businesses).  This public announcement is for the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVO) competition and is intended to result in a single award.  Of the total $15,000,000 programmatic capacity, the total capacity of $5,000,000 is estimated fo r the SDVO award.  The A-E Contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for an MRR construction (with design-build capabilities) contract (see W912DY-06-R-0028, W912DY-07-R-0030, and W912D Y-07-R-0031).  Placement of task orders will be consistent with FAR subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services and subpart 16.5, Indefinite Delivery Contracts.  The Government will provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order  exceeding $3,000 issued under the multiple ID/IQ A-E contracts.  The Government will consider award of the A-E task order to the SDVO awardee prior to consideration of the unrestricted awardees.  If it is determined inappropriate to award the task order t o the SDVO awardee, the Government will then consider the unrestricted awardees for the task order award.  If the Government has information available to ensure that each awardee is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order, the Governmen t may not contact each of the multiple awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee.  When selecting an order awardee the Government will consider:  a.   Capability to perform the level of complexity required for successful execution of th e task;  b.   Past performance on earlier orders under the contract, including quality, timeliness and cost control; c.   Potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor; and d.   Minimum order requirements.  Cost will not be an evaluation fact or to be considered in selecting an order awardee.  Formal evaluation plans and scoring of quotes or offers will not be required.  The Government will give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for a delivery-order or task-order exceeding $3,00 0 unless an exemption provided in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  The Medical Repair and Renewal A-E contracts provide all services required to prepare plans, specifications, work plans and other supporting documents necessary for execution of the MRR projects issued by task order.  As part of the d esign effort the contractor may be required to survey the problem areas, evaluate and recommend solutions.  The level of detail and format of the design packages may vary dependent upon the complexity of the MRR project.  A complete design, including a bid schedule, an order of work clause, a construction contractor submittal register, quantity and c ost estimated, MCACES construction cost estimates, a proposed construction schedule, design analyses and calculations, a design document report, an engineering considerations and instructions report, and a draft operations and maintenance manual shall be d eveloped for each project.  In addition to project designs the contractor may be required to conduct studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, evaluations, consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, value en gineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, preparation of parametric estimates, equipment and systems commissioning and other related services. Offerors must have specialize d experience and technical competence in medical facility, equipment, and systems design.  In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Government may direct the A-E Contractor to perform any part or all  of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contract.   SELECTION CRITERIA:  The selection criteria for the basic ID/IQ contracts are listed below and are equal in importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion).  Criteria a-e are primary.  Criteria f is secondary and will only be used as a  tie-breaker among firms that are essentially technically equal.   a.

(2)  Experience of the prime firm and significant subcontra ctors (i.e. any subcontract which equals 10% or more of the prime contract) in working together.  This experience should show successful completion of projects, on time, under budget and past project quality ratings.  (3)  Experience in adapting standard d esign packages.  The adaptations should demonstrate space conversions (warehouses to clinics for example), working with existing systems in renovating portions of hospitals.  (4) Rehabilitation of existing medical facilities of various types, sizes, and co mplexities.  (5)  Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria.  (6)  Design of projects on Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veteran Affairs, State Department, Department of Interior, Department of Energy, De partment of Transportation, and state and local government medical facilities.  (7)  Specific technical capabilities, such as construction cost estimating, scheduling, value engineering and materials testing.  The technical capabilities should demonstrate the type of equipment or software used and the need for subcontractors to perform these tasks.  (8) Knowledge of specific laws and regulations.  The contractor should demonstrate a working knowledge of JCAHO, Medical installation standards and local codes and regulations that govern medical facilities.  (9)  Compatibility with specific CAD equipment, and format of required CAD products. The contractor should demonstrate competency with Bentley Microstation CAD software, necessary equipment to run software, USACE A/E/C CADD standards, production of PDF files for advertisement and the ability to convert CAD production source files into fully functional, error free files of AutoCAD and other required CAD products.(10)  Knowledge of design criteria for medical f acilit ies. This would include, but not limited to operating rooms, dental clinics, laboratories, occupational health clinics, and animal laboratories.  (11)  Design quality management approach.  Specifically, how will the contractor maintain the quality of the d esign and cost control. What system is in place to assure the design quality is maintained?   b.

<DESC>DeCA is currently using Traffic Management Information System (TRAMIS) to manage the transportation of grocery and office supplies from two Distribution Centers located in Germany to about 60 commissaries located in Germany, UK, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The TRAMIS software has reached the end of product lifecycle and DeCA is looking to replace it with a more robust and feature rich TMS solution that incorporates a Service Oriented Architecture. The TMS will include automated interfaces to Warehouse Management System (WMS) and PowerTrack (bill payment system).  This software acquisition is in support of a DeCA mission essential system. The TMS will interface with WMS and an external financial system to improve the overall efficiency of the movement of goods from the distribution centers to the commissaries and process payments for services rendered.  The TMS system to be implemented will conform to open standards and operate within a Service Oriented architecture. This will allow the system to be extended to other DeCA operating regions with different business operating procedures. DeCA will also be reviewing vendor proposals that offer TMS Software as a Service (SaaS) provided they meet all functional, technical and Information Assurance (IA) requirements and provide a better Return on Investment (ROI) than conventional software purchase and deploy option.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THE RFI.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will  be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to access tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  This RFI is issued for the purpose of seeking sources capable of meeting the requirements outlined in the attached Draft Statement of Work.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing real time data processing equipment equal to the salient characteristics listed to meet the form, fit, and function of a the existing link management system with specially instrumented receiver ? low volume terminal link 16 (LMS-16 W/SIR-LVT Workstation) manufactured by Northrop Grumman.  The LMS has the following function requirements: 

?The Link Management System (LMS) enables Joint Interface Control Officers (JICO) to manage tactical data link networks.
?LMS is a workstation-based Link 16 management and network level diagnostic tool.
?LMS actively monitors and manages Link 16 Radar Frequency (RF) network information during live operations.
?LMS interfaces directly with a Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Low Volume Terminal (LVT) to transmit and receive J-series messages, and decode JTIDS RF signals to provide Link 16 troubleshooting metrics to LMS-16 displays.
?LMS assists JICO and other network managers detect problems in real time that interfere with generating a coherent tactical picture.
?LMS automatically alerts operators to existing and potential problems, and records data for later analysis.
?LMS provides a current tactical situation display.
?LMS display has a JICO white board option that projects a display depicting a real-time, color-coded update of the status of each participant in the network.
?LMS has a Network Summary Display that provides an assessment of total link performance to include relationships between Individual Units (IUs), connectivity, equipment failures and resets, performance comparisons, total track load per frame by ID, and relayer usage per frame.
?LMS Tactical Window can depict IUs with range circles centered on them, indicating line-of-sight limitations.
?LMS Information Window shows which IUs are being received only by relay, and tells if data from individual IUs contain errors or erasures.  Other connectivity information includes range, time and position qualities, amount of surveillance capacity use, track load, average track age, and which unit is acting as forwarding unit for a unit whose data is being forwarded.
?Transmission security on the data link is achieved by hopping among 51 possible frequencies in a pseudorandom pattern.  A decoding algorithm provides some, but not complete, protection from errors (incorrect data) and erasures (missing data).  The LMS tabulates erasures and displays the percentage for each frequency in a bar graph.  It also displays erasures by word.  Green indicates the percentage of good words; correctable errors are orange; and decode failures are red.
?LMS Trend Windows provide historical information on PPLI connectivity, range, surveillance utilization, time slot duty factor measurements, erasure levels, and distribution of Track IDs.  The operator can focus on one IU or compare performances among IUs.
?LMS operator can observe how the network capacity has been allocated to functional groups to determine if any IUs require more capacity to prevent loss of data and reallocate time slot assignments.
?The Transmit Time Slot Reference Window provides a graphic display of the 12-second JTIDS frame as defined by the network design.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposal, quotation, or intivitation to bid notice. This sources sought is issued for two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community; and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of interest ed small business firms or teams for the recompetition of the Program Executive Office for Simulation Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract, W9113M-05-A-0002.  The existing contracting contains  a period of performance of approximately 45 months with obligations of $120 Mil.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 with a small business size standard of $25 Mil for this acquisition. The RFP is expected to be 100 percent set-aside for small business and will therefore contain FAR clause 52.219-14  (must be met by the prime contractor, not collective small business team members). The follow-on acquisition will result in a single IDIQ award with fixed-price labor categories and cost reimbursable travel and materials line items. The resultant contract  will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit the awardee from participating in any other PEO STRI contracts.  To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Governments interests, the OCI clause will be a pplied only for the supported technology areas of the contractors actual SETA performance. In order to be considered for award, offerors must possess or be able to obtain a TOP SECRET facility security clearance.    The non-personal services include related activities in support of all aspects of simulation, training, and instrumentation systems. Support will be required for the full life cycle of projects to include planning, design, development, engineering, impleme ntation, procurement, logistics, evaluation, sustainment and ancillary services in the areas of: Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM), Concept Analysis, Systems Testing, Technical Assessment, Training System Related Documentation, GFE/GFM In ventory, Technical Data, Engineering, Presentation Materials, System Analysis, Maintain Technical Data Repository, Maintainability, Logistics Support, Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Environmental, Safety and Health, Planning and Reporting, Budgeting and Cost Analysis, Readiness, System Quality Assurance, Foreign Military Sales, Configuration Management, Administration and Operations, Training, Post Production Software, Technical and Systems Engineering.

Naval Air Systems Command, Aviation Support Equipment Program Office (PMA260) requests information which will serve as a market and technology survey to assist NAVAIR in developing its acquisition strategy for a full and open competition to develop a replacement system for the existing mainframe Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) AN/USM-636 (V) Test Station with a next generation test station, herein referred to as electronic Consolidated Automated Support System (eCASS). 
  

General Description: The CASS mission is to provide a common family of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) for the purpose of performing automated avionics testing at Navy Intermediate (Ship and Shore) and Depot-Level maintenance sites. Current CASS test stations are approaching the end of their service life. The vision is that eCASS will include two station variants: 
1) A Radio Frequency (RF) station comprised of digital, low frequency, power, control, radio frequency and communication subsystems and; 2) A Hybrid station capable of supporting CASS Electro-Optics (EO) test requirements by hosting the existing CASS EO3 console.  The Hybrid station shall be a logistically common subset of the RF station tailored to support EO weapon system Test Program Sets (TPSs). 
 

The RF test station will be compatible for use with the existing CASS High Power Device Test Set (HPDTS) and the future Communications, Navigation, and Identification (CNI) Ancillary Set, currently under development.  Existing and new CASS ancillary equipment shall be used with the two variants (Hybrid and RF) to meet the full range of testing currently performed on all CASS test station variants.   eCASS shall be designed for shipboard use and shall be compliant with the draft eCASS specification and other applicable DoN documentation.  eCASS shall be capable of supporting existing CASS Test Program Sets (TPSs) for approximately 2000 avionics components.  The station shall be designed to minimize any changes to TPSs and to maintain or improve the fidelity of test, run-times, and performance.  The offeror will be responsible for any TPS software processes and related tools required for migration to eCASS. The new test station shall have a compatibility mode that will emulate existing CASS station characteristics in order to maintain legacy CASS TPS performance and an eCASS mode that includes the full complement of station capabilities. 


The Government is defining its acquisition strategy to operationally field eCASS test stations to the warfighter to replace the existing CASS stations starting no later than CY15.  The Request For Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be issued in third (3rd) Quarter of Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 08 with an anticipated contract award in early second (2nd) Quarter of GFY 09.  The contract type will be either Fixed Price, Cost Plus, or a combination of both. Based on our current understanding of industry capabilities a three-year System Development and Demonstration (SD&D) phase is projected to include qualification testing followed by Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) I & II builds.  The anticipated quantities for the basic contract will include efforts to design, test and produce Two (2) Hybrid and Two (2) RF pre-production test stations primarily used for qualification testing. The anticipated LRIP I &II quantities may consist of Two to Four (2-4) Hybrid and Ten to Sixteen (10-16) RF test stations each to support TPS regression and operational testing. The Navy plans to separately award follow-on contract(s) for the remaining production quantity of Seventy to Eighty (70-80) Hybrid and Three Hundred to Three Hundred Twenty (300-320) RF test stations.  


Nominal schedule: -Industry day 09/2007 (Information to be provided via separate announcement); - RFP Release Third (3rd) Quarter of GFY08; -Contract award; - early Second (2nd) Quarter GFY09; - 3 year SD&D Phase; - 12-20 unit LRIP each in 2011 and 2012; - Operational Testing 2012-2013; - FRP 2014 (35-50 Stations/Year).

<SUBJECT>R -- Scientific Management skills course
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), in Bethesda, Maryland and the Office of Intramural Research (OIR) plans to procure on a sole source basis with HWS Enterprises to develop and run a management skills course specifically oriented to scientists.  The objectives of the course will be to provide: assessments of management styles, through the use of those standard tests useful for scientific leadership (360 skill scope, Myers Briggs Type Inventory and Thomas ? Killman Conflict Inventory), assessment of leadership skills and self knowledge, training in the time management, training in conflict resolution, training in getting the best from teams, training in decision making, training in motivating others and identification and development of a plan for goal setting.  The contractor shall be knowledgeable of the theory and practice of education in management skills, demonstrated experience in development of a specific program appropriate for scientists, demonstrated expertise in facilitation of the program with scientists and extensive and demonstrated expertise in program evaluation and follow-up design. The course must be developed and presented by individuals experienced with the issues that scientists have and whom scientist will find credible.  NIH /OIR will be responsible for all costs associated with the logistics of the meeting, including but not limited to meeting room, audio visual, food, and local transportation, facilitating pre-session logistics with the participants, including ensuring their completion of the testing material.  The Contractor should deliver 30 copies of testing materials one month prior to the training.  Once the training has been completed, the Contractor should deliver five hard copies, along with a copy on a PC- compatible disk (in WordPerfect or  MS Word), of the final program evaluation and follow-up design.   NIH believes that the above reference firm is the only source that can provide this requirement. HWS is an expert in the development of management skills courses which are needed to continue the ongoing training needed to manage the increased complexities of modern biomedical research and the only firm to specifically design such a course for scientists.  HWS has designed courses for the PEW Scholars and is currently preparing a series for faculty at UCSF Medical School.  HWS has experience and knowledge related to the area of management skills.  NIH tenured and tenure-tract investigators to manage their laboratories, personnel and resources enable the tenure-track investigators to achieve success in becoming tenured.  HWS has successfully handled numerous courses over the past years, and have received excellent ratings from all the PIs who have taken the courses. However, if any other interested party believes that they can meet the requirements they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain detailed documentation to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation.  Respondents will not be notified of evaluation results.  The closing date will be 10 calendar days after publication.  All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor?s Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date.  If not registered or active by that date, vendor proposals will be considered non responsive.

This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13, and it will provide comprehensive Accident Investigation and Root Cause Analysis training that is critical to PHMSA. 

Conger & Elsea, Inc. conducts a vast majority of pipeline failure accident investigations and root cause analyses for a variety of Federal agencies, including the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Navy, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).  The extensive experience of Conger & Elsea, Inc. corresponds closely to the PHMSA?s need for expert software and training on accident investigation using the updated MORT system safety approach.  Conger & Elsea, Inc. has trained more than 10,000 people in their systematic approach to root cause analysis and corrective action program assessment.  The instructors are certified as MORT instructors by the Department of Energy.  In addition, Conger & Elsea, Inc. is the only provider of the MAPS software that is the tool that PHMSA and many other Federal agencies used when performing accident investigations and root cause analysis.

Any response to this notice must demonstrate that competition would be advantageous to the government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet PHMSA?s needs.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted no later than 5:00 PM EDT on Wednesday, September 19, 2007 to the PMHSA Office of Contracts and Procurement, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, East Building, 2nd Floor, Room E22-229, Washington, DC 20590 or via e-mail at karina.munoz@dot.gov ATTN: Karina Munoz.

<SUBJECT>19 -- Special Operations Forces (SOF) Maritime Mobility Operations and Capabilities
<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is soliciting white papers/proposals for Research and Development (R&D) projects which offer potential for advancement of Special Operating Forces (SOF) maritime mobility operations and capabilities. A formal Request for Proposal (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued. Request for same will be disregarded.

The USSOCOM reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement. USSOCOM provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Technical and cost proposals (if requested), or any other material submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned. It is the policy of USSOCOM to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.         

1.  The following general aspects/topic areas are examples (but not limited to and not in order of importance) of applied research and development in support of SOF combatant craft. (a)  Advanced hull forms having improved ride quality over conventional deep-vee monohulls, low multi-spectral signatures, high payload weight-fraction, high speed in a seaway, and good sea keeping and maneuverability throughout the range of operations.

(k) Small, lightweight, reliable and easily maintained hull, mechanical and electrical systems capable of surviving in a demanding maritime environment.   

2.  The USSOCOM requires a family of combatant craft to meet SOF maritime mobility and operational requirements.  Although the above research and development topics are applicable to a wide range of combatant craft, request that research and development proposals target technology development that support one or both of following specific combatant craft requirements. 

(a) A small, tactical craft with the following general requirements: (1)   Multi-function craft capable of infiltration and extraction and maritime interdiction operations (MIO). (2) Air transportable by a C-130 aircraft. (3) Crew of up to 4 personnel and carry up to 8 passengers and their associated gear. (4) Speed in excess of 40 knots in a Sea State 3. (5) Station keeping capability and maneuverability to perform safe transfer of personnel during ship boardings and maritime interdiction operations. (6) Low multi-spectral signatures for reduced observability. (7) Round trip endurance of 300+ nautical miles at speeds greater than 30Kts. 

(b) A medium range and endurance craft with the following general requirements: (1) Multi-function craft capable of infiltration and extraction, special reconnaissance and surveillance operations. (2) Large payload capacity with the ability to launch and recover a SEAL Delivery Vehicle or combatant craft up to 40 feet in length.  (Small tactical craft requirements noted in paragraph (a) above.) (3) Operating endurance of 4 to 7 days. (4) Operating range of 900+ nautical miles at speeds greater than 25 kts. (5) Able to support up to 22 embarked personnel. (6) Low multi-spectral signatures for reduced observability. (g) Self-defense weapons and countermeasures. 

3.  WHITE PAPER CONTENT:  Institutions having demonstrated research capability and the necessary facilities are invited to submit a white paper. It is not the intent of this BAA for institutions to establish new facilities.

The cover page should be labeled ?WHITE PAPER? and should include the BAA number, proposal title, technology thrust areas addressed, and technical points of contact with telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address. This should only be one (1) page. The technical part of the white paper should not exceed four pages of text including appendices and should describe: the research and development objective; the technical approach; related work by the investigator or proposer; anticipated contributions/benefits to SOF maritime surface mobility; a resume of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the white paper; and an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for up to a three year effort;. White papers exceeding any of these page restrictions may not be reviewed. IMPORTANT NOTE: Titles given to the white papers/proposals should be descriptive of the work they cover and not be merely a copy of the title of this BAA. 

4.  EVALUATION CRITERIA. White papers, and any follow-up full proposal submission, will be evaluated on the following criteria:  technical merits of the R&D; qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support the research and development; relevance of the proposed research to USSOCOM program priorities and requirements; and realism of proposed costs, and availability of funds.

5.  EVALUATION/NOTIFICATION:  The USSOCOM may use selected support personnel to assist in providing both technical expertise and administrative support regarding any ensuing proposals from this announcement. These support contractors will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information.  Initial evaluations of the white papers will be issued via e-mail notification.  Detailed technical and cost proposals will be subsequently encouraged especially from those offerors whose proposal technologies have been identified through the above-referenced e-mail as being of ?particular value? to the USSOCOM. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award.  

5.  AWARD.  All responsible sources may submit a white paper, which may be considered by the Government. Small businesses are encouraged to submit white papers and joining others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. Based upon the evaluation criteria identified in paragraph 4 above, USSOCOM will award single or multiple contracts in accordance with technical priority and funding availability.  

6.  There will be no other requests for proposals or other formal solicitations regarding this announcement. Formal full proposals for competitive review will be requested based on those white paper submissions judged most likely to meet program objectives. Proposal deadline date and format instruction will be provided at that time.  This announcement will remain open for one year from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA.  White papers may be submitted  any time during this period, however to be considered for the initial round of review and possible funding, white papers must be received no later than 10 October 2007.  White papers will be reviewed on a quarterly basis thereafter.

<SUBJECT>R -- Whole Genome Association Study to Identify and Validate Genes for Restenosis in the Ottawa Heart Study
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. 

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intend to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to the University of Ottawa, Heart Institute, 40 Ruskin Street, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  The intent of this procurement is to acquire information regarding the genetic susceptibility to the vascular disease, restenosis.  The NHGRI DIR, is conducting a study, entitled CardioGene(1), which is an analysis of the genomics of in-stent restenosis.  NHGRI wish to validate genetic associations in an independent population of patients who have received bare metallic stents, to determine which specific polymorphisms may confer susceptibility to restenosis.

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the University of Ottawa Heart Institute?s  Dr. McPherson, Dr. So, and others have recently published a report on genetic susceptibility to coronary artery disease(2) and the Genotypes are already available for these patients from the University of Ottawa Heart Institute.   The University of Ottawa Heart Institute is the sole provider of the specific patient data that the NHGRI seeks: patients with existing genetic data and established coronary artery disease, who have undergone bare metallic stent implantation and have corresponding clinical data from which wer may determine whether in-stend restenosis occurred.   Therefore, the Unviersity of Ottawa Heart Institute is the only known source that is currently able to assist the NHGRI in this area of research at this time.  An award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  

The Statement of Work is as follows.
Background Information - The purpose of this project is to acquire information regarding the genetic susceptibility to the vascular disease, restenosis. In the NHGRI DIR, we are conducting a study, entitled CardioGene(1), which is an analysis of the genomics of in-stent restenosis. We now wish to validate genetic associations in an independent population of patients who have received bare metallic stents, to determine which specific polymorphisms may confer susceptibility to restenosis. Dr. McPherson, Dr. So and others have recently published a report on genetic susceptibility to coronary artery disease(2). Genotypes are already available for these patients.

Objectives - To identify the genetic cause of restenosis by validating candidate genetic susceptibility loci identified by the CardioGene Study, by studying the genetic sequence of individuals who received a coronary artery stent versus those who did not and to apply this information to develop new drugs and DNA based diagnostics. By validating candidate susceptibility genes and regions in an independent population, we can determine true associations and identify functional candidate genes for this disease. This knowledge can, in turn, be used to gain a better understanding of the underlying biologic mechanisms of disease.

To compare individuals who experience restenosis after the placement of a coronary artery stent versus those who did not experience restenosis of their stents within twelve months of coronary stent implantation. Existing genotype data on approximately 500,000 single nucleotide DNA polymorphisms will be used for this study.

General Requirements - Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services (except as otherwise specific herein) and perform the work set forth below.   All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer, whose position is defined elsewhere in this contract. 

Specific requirements - Collaborators at the Ottawa Heart Institute will be responsible for:
1)  Identifying within the Ottawa Heart Study cohort all cases of in-stent restenosis and an equal number of controls patients who have received a bare metallic stent in a coronary artery and clinical follow-up data 12 months post-procedure, to determine if restenosis occurred or not.  2)  Review all medical history, including cardiac catheterization history, so that in-stent restenosis events in any bare metallic stent may be identified and so that control patients are documented to have never had an in-stent restenosis episode in any bare metal stent placed in a na?ve coronary artery lesion.  3)  Provide basic medical history including demographic data, medical history, medication use and cardiac catherization data for the index procedure in which the bare metallic stent was placed as well as any follow-up catheterizations.  4) All clinical data will be sent to the NIH without any direct patient identifiers, using assigned study numbers to code the samples and data.

Reporting Requirements - Progress will be monitored over the estimated two to four months this activity will take through email and telephone conversations with the Project Officers.   A final progress report will be submitted, after the conclusion of the clinical data reviews.


Packaging and Marking - The items shall be packaged and marked in accordance with a mutually agreeable format. 

Inspection and Acceptance - The final results of this acquisition will be determined by the receipt of DNA samples and clinical data from patients, as specified. Acceptance will be based upon the delivery of useable clinical data.

Deliverables - A final progress report will be submitted electronically to the Project Officers. 

The expected period of performance is four (4) months from the date of the award.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6, Competition Requirements.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541990 with a size standard of  $6.5 M.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive  proposals.  Interested parties  may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB(HG)-2007-241-KLW, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Kesha L.

<SUBJECT>16 -- eCASS INDUSTRY DAY
<DESC>1.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE BUT RATHER, NOTIFICATION OF AN INDUSTRY DAY.  The Naval Air Systems Command Aviation Support Equipment Program Office (PMA260) is hosting an Industry Day on 20 & 21 September 2007 at the Baltimore Convention Center, Room 314.  Directions to the facility are available at www.bccenter.org. The purpose of the event is to provide industry with program insight and to solicit feedback from interested industry representatives regarding an initiative to replace existing U.S. Navy's Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) Automated Test Equipment with a modernized replacement, commonly referred to as eCASS.  We welcome industry participation to review and discuss issues and concerns related to the Government's technical requirements. 

2.  At 2PM on 20 September, we will provide an eCASS Program brief in Room 314 after which we will convene an open session for general discussion on issues and concerns.  To alleviate seating constraints, please limit attendance to only pertinent personnel.  Attached is a form that we request that industry use in its submission of questions.    We request that any pre-industry day questions be emailed directly to points of contact as listed at the bottom of this announcement.  Our intent is to respond to all questions received prior to industry day during the open session.  Any questions that cannot be immediately answered at the open session should be submitted in writing utilizing pre-printed forms available herein and at the administration desk in Room 314.  Any questions that a company considers proprietary should be marked as such and will be answered separately and handled appropriately.  

3.  PMA260 will reconvene from 8AM until 9AM on 21 September to provide answers/feedback on the submitted questions presented during the open session.  If further time is necessary, answers to any remaining questions will be posted on FedBizOps at a later date.  

4.  Upon adjourning from the main forum at 9AM on 21 September, for those industry representatives who intend to perform as an eCASS prime contractor, PMA260 will host one-on-one sessions in Room 314 for the remainder of the day.  Unfortunately, time constraints mandate that only those intending to perform as prime contractors be afforded a single one-on-one session.  One-on-one sessions shall be limited to five industry representatives in attendance.  Appointments for one-on-one sessions may be made by contacting Mrs. Carla Rowell at (301) 757-6890.  All appointments should be scheduled no later than 12 September 2007, 11:30 A.M. EDT. After that date and time no further appointments will be scheduled. Our intent for the one-on-one is to have open communication with the understanding that all non-proprietary questions and responses generated during the one-on-one session will be provided to industry.  Any proprietary questions will be noted and handled appropriately. The subject non-proprietary questions, responses and any additional Government program information that might be conveyed during one-on-one sessions shall be disseminated industry-wide via a follow-on FebBizOps posting.  

Points of Contact

1.  Questions may be emailed to Jeff Llewellyn at jeffrey.llewellyn@navy.mil, or Chris Giggey at chris.giggey@navy.mil. 
2.  Potential eCASS prime contractors may make appointments for one-on-one sessions by contacting Carla Rowell at (301) 757-6890.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation being issued is 07SQ340174 and proposals (including the completed FAR 52.212-03, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items) are due Thursday, September 13, 2007, 4:00 p.m. local time.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-19.  This procurement is being issued as full and open/unrestricted competition.  The NAICS Code is 423830 and the small business size standard is 100 employees.  The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation, to the Contractor whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  This award is contingent on the availability of year end funding.  The Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office, has a requirement to purchase the following sizes of W-K-M Dynacentric, Cast 316 stainless steel, ¼ turn, double-offset, High Performance Butterfly Valves (HPBV) with Remote Control RCEL series electric valve actuators, with the necessary torque requirements for operating their mating, respective W-K-M butterfly valves under the following Operating Conditions: Valves shall be located at the Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP) reverse osmosis control blocks.  The valves and associated actuators will be required to operate in a temperature range of 0 degree Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) to 50 degree Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit).  Valves shall be bidirectional and shall be capable of handling water with a specific gravity of 1.0.  The operational ph range of the water will be between 4 and 6, with a total dissolved solids content of 3,000 mg/l (3,000 parts per million).  For the 300# Pressure Class valves, the maximum operating pressure differential will be 500 pounds per square inch (PSI). For the 150# Pressure Class valves, the maximum operating pressure differential will be 275 psi. The actuators shall be sized for the necessary torque requirements to seal, breakaway, and operate under the conditions outlined for their respective valves. This is an acquisition for Brand Name product based on the Bureau of Reclamations recent purchase of 120 butterfly valves and actuators from the same manufacturer at a total investment of $280,000.  These valves and actuators meet the following minimum specifications:  VALVES:  1) Valves shall be designed and built in accordance with ASME B16.34 (1996);  2) One Piece, Cast 316 Stainless Steel Body per ASTM A351 (2000), CF8M body material, wetted parts to be 316SS minimum; 3) Stainless Steel Shaft, 17-4 PH, blowout protected; 4) ASTM A351 (2000) CF8M disc with 316 SST/Grafoil laminated seal stack; 5) Monel bolting for wetted parts preferable, 316SS satisfactory;  6) Wafer or Lug end connections as stated below; 7) 316SS Metallic Seat with PTFE seat insert, fire-tested, bi-directional or other equivalent or better disc seal, subject to approval; 8) Grafoil or better packing; 9) Bare stem with no operator; 10)  Meets ANSI 70-2 Class VI Shutoff Test Criteria in Preferred Direction; 11) Hydrostatic test report documenting seat leakage results; and 12) Bearing Protectors.  ACTUATORS:  1)  Voltage - Single phase 120VAC (60 Hz); 2) Action - Open-Close with Fail Last Position; 3) Motor Type - Squirrel cage induction type with class F insulation; 4) Motor Brake - Standard, or Self-locking Worm Gear Drive for holding valve position; 5) Motor protection - Thermal switch trip and torque switch trip; 6) Enclosure - Watertight, NEMA 4; 7) Surface Cooling; 8) Override Control - Manual Handwheel; 9) Control Input - Remote N.O. contacts; 10) Fully Open / Fully Closed Limit Switches - Rated at 10Amps; 11) Isolated Aux. limit switches or contacts for both full open and full close - Rated at 10Amps, Adjustable; 11) Mechanical Position Indicator - O/C Position, Continuous; 12) SS Valve/Actuator Adapter Plates; and 13) All gearing shall be grease lubricated and designed to withstand the full stall torque of motor, a seized or inoperable motor shall not prevent manual operation.  Purchasing these valves and actuators from these suppliers achieves two goals - it reduces spare-part replacement and inventory costs and it increases plant operational efficiency and reliability.  Because of the Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP) unusual size and configuration, it is standard practice to stock spare parts on site to minimize operation down time due to equipment or instrument failure.  To reduce the cost of purchasing parts and the cost of managing the inventory of spare parts, the goal is to maintain a uniform, interchangeable set of accurate and reliable equipment.  Purchase of the valves and actuators from these manufacturers will enable the valves, actuators, gaskets, etc., to be interchanged, increasing operational effectiveness/efficiency/reliability, and reducing the variety of parts that must be stocked.  YAO currently has spare parts for these valves and actuators with an estimated value of $34,700.  During the recent 90 day demonstration run, these valves and actuators proved that they can withstand the difficult service of the YDP's reverse-osmosis process control blocks.  Since the YDP is normally offline and only runs when called upon, we have to be sure that our equipment will meet the challenge when told to do so. We do not have the luxury of gambling on unproven products. The YDP is a very high visibility Reclamation site that is always in the public eye. If the plant does not run reliably and well when called upon, it is very detrimental to the reputation of the Bureau and its Commissioner.  These valves and actuators are being purchased to replace 1/3 of the originals valves obtained by the Bureau when the plant was first built. The originals are being replaced because they failed to meet YDP's difficult service requirement. In fact, the original valves and actuators are formally recognized as a "Design Deficiency" of the YDP. If we purchase unproven valves for this service, we risk replacing one "Design Deficiency" with another.  This requirement will include a 200 percent option quantity for each line item.  The Contractor shall furnish and size all necessary valve/actuator adapter plates. The option quantities will be a separately priced line item.     (1) 8", 300# Double-Offset SS Wafer W-K-M HPBV Model No. 08-5320-02-F02-14-00 with Remote Control 120 VAC 60Hz Actuator Model RCEL-100-ALS-A120 - 15 Sets  $_____; 200 Percent Option Quantity - 30 Sets $____;    (2)  6", 300#, Double -Offset, SS Lug-Type W-K-M HPBV Model No. 06-5323-02-F02-14-00 with Remote Control 120 VAC 60Hz Actuator Model RCEL-50-ALS-A120 - 60 Sets $____; 200 Percent Option Quantity - 120 Sets $____;     (3) 6", 150# Double-Offset, SS Wafer W-K-M HPBV Model No. 06-5120-02-F02-14-00 with Remote Control 120 VAC 60Hz Actuator RCEL Series Model that meets the requirements listed in this document  - 15 Sets  $_____; 200 Percent Option Quantity - 30 Sets  $_____;    (4) 3", 300# Double-Offset SS Wafer W-K-M HPBV Model No. 03-5320-02-F02-14-00 with Remote Control 120 VAC 60Hz Actuators RCEL-15-ALS-A120 - 15 sets  $_____; 200 Percent Option Quantity - 30 Sets  $_____; and     (5) 3", 150#, Double-Offset SS Wafer W-K-M HPBV Model No. 03-5120-02-F02-14-00 with Remote Control 120 VAC 60 Hz RCEL Series Model that meets all the requirements listed in this document - 15 Sets  $_____; 200 Percent Option Quantity - 30 Sets  $_____.

BACKGROUND:  In support of Reclamation's wind-driven brackish groundwater desalination research project with Texas Tech University, the drilling and casing of exploratory wells into the Santa Rosa aquifer of the Dockum group are required.  The sites for the wells to be drilled and cased are near the municipality of Seminole in Gaines County and near the town of Plains in Yoakum County.  On the basis of preliminary hydrologic investigations, it is anticipated that the depth to the water bearing layer in Seminole will be 1300 to 1500 ft.  For Plains, the anticipated depth is expected to be 600 to 700 ft.  Because of the differing depths, the shallower Plains well will be drilled first. WORK TO BE PERFORMED BY CONTRACTOR:  The vendor shall supply the equipment, manpower, and casing material needed to drill and case one or more wells into the Santa Rosa aquifer at Plains in Yoakum County and Seminole in Gaines County.  The two locations are within 35 miles of each other in west Texas near the New Mexico border.   The vendor should specify if the wells will be drilled and cased using the same equipment (and thus moving it from the first to the second site) or whether two rigs will be deployed for drilling operations in parallel.  For each location, the drilled well should accommodate a casing having a minimum inside diameter of five (5) inches.  Schedule is an important aspect of this procurement.  While the well sites are close to Plains and Seminole, the exact location in each case has not yet been set.  The sites will however be within three (3) miles of the respective town limits and will be accessible to heavy equipment on roads maintained by the State or county.  Utility electric power and water will be available at both sites.  The vendor will need to specify any other site or materiel requirements that may be required for drilling operations.

<SUBJECT>B -- Human biospecimens
<SOLNBR>263-2007-Q-GZ-0197
<RESPDATE>091807
<ARCHDATE>10032007
<CONTACT>Doris Vaughn, Purchasing Agent, Phone 301-402-3351, Fax 301-480-3662, Email vaughn@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) along with the Office of Rare Diseases plans to procure on a sole source basis with the RAND CORP to facilitate research leading to treatments and cures for rare diseases, by improving researchers? access to needed human biospecimens through an expanded and updated Human Biospecimen Database.  The interactive database when seen as viable by the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) will be accessible to the researchers and the public through  a Web browser, will be searchable on line, and will contain detailed information about biorepositories in the United States and worldwide that collect, store, and distribute biospecimens for research use. 
1.	Expanding and updating the Human Biospecimen Database for biorepositories in the United States and worldwide that collect, store, and distribute human biospecimens for research use. For rare diseases research it is essential to be able to access international repositories in addition to US repositories because human tissues and clinical data may need to be obtained from several sources, including some that are in countries outside the USA.
2.	This approach will facilitate researchers? access to biospecimens for use in research by providing and maintaining a comprehensive system that enables access to information about biorepositories and their collections in the United States and worldwide in one location.
3.	Identifying unmet needs of researchers in obtaining biospecimens for research on rare diseases.
4.	Identifying specific constraints and other barriers relating to the access to biospecimens for research.
5.	Providing information to rare diseases researchers, the wider research community and other interested parties including patient advocacy groups and the pharmaceutical industry about the types and locations of human biorepositories and the biospecimens and clinical data available from them.  Diseases Research Working Group, established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Rare Diseases (ORD), recognized the need for developing a system for accessing information on human biospecimen collections, storage, and distribution for rare diseases research, as well as research in general. The full development of such a comprehensive, searchable, Web-based database along with regular updates will allow researchers to realize the promise of genomics and proteomics by giving them information about and access to appropriately collected, consented, and annotated biospecimens. 
The database, called the Human Biospecimen Database, will be accessible via a Web browser, searchable online, and populated with information about biospecimens at biorepositories in the United States and worldwide.  This Human Biospecimen Database is the first of its kind and will be extremely useful to rare diseases researchers when it includes appropriate USA and international resources. The new database will contain up-to-date information for biomedical researchers, other research funding entities, professional societies, patient advocacy groups, research administrators, and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. All parties will be able to use the database to identify and obtain resources for basic and translational research as well as drug development in rare diseases, genetics, rare and common diseases studies, immunology, physiology, cell biology, etc. 
 
 
Task 1:  Expanding the information contained in the Human Biospecimen Database with information from biorepositories in the United States and worldwide
?	The RAND CORP staff will update and expand information about biorepositories in the United States and in other countries around the globe by inviting the biorepository leadership to update or provide new information about their repositories and collections. 
?	All biorepositories will be invited to provide information about their repositories for inclusion in the database as determined in the earlier design and development. 
?	Repositories will be invited to provide information using the data entry Web site built previously. The Web site already contains a standardized template for data entry. The repositories will be directed to the Web site, and will be given a unique identifier and PIN number to give them access to their organization?s information and allow them to complete the data entry in multiple sessions, if desired. The repositories will also be given the option to provide information using alternative formats.  Technical assistance from the contractor will be offered to repositories sponsored by rare diseases patient advocacy groups or others who may not be able to enter the information without such assistance.
Task 2:  Hosting, maintaining, and updating the database 
The RAND CORP  will maintain the database and Web-based interface, which is currently located on contractor?s internal server. To maintain the full utility of the Web site and to keep the information current, it will be important to update the database. Repositories will be invited to update the information on an as-needed basis. All repositories will be invited annually to update their information. The contractor will track and add newly established repositories and delete repositories that no longer exist. 
Task 3:  Collecting information about unmet needs of the research community in obtaining human biospecimens for research purposes: 
To better understand unmet needs of the research community in obtaining human biospecimens for research on rare diseases, the contractor will monitor the Web interface to allow users of the Web site to provide feedback on their successes or failures in obtaining the human biospecimens needed for their research. Feedback from users of the Web site who are unable to locate biospecimens will be obtained through the following:  A voluntary feedback box that is a pop-up window that appears after unsuccessful searches for biospecimens.  Information collected through the voluntary feedback box and pop-up window on unfulfilled requests will be analyzed and used to generate periodic reports to ORD.  This information will also be made available in its aggregate and after analysis to the biorepositories that are part of the database. ORD and the contractor will initiate a broad invitation to provide information through publishing a request in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts and sending individual letters containing information from the NIH Guide as needed.


 Task 4: Developing educational modules for inclusion in the Human Biospecimen Database Web site: Additional modules will be added to the Human Biospecimen Database Web site by the 	contractor. These additional modules will be developed by the contractor in collaboration with 	ORD senior staff and will include educational components to guide researchers and 	repositories.  In addition to analyzing data from the Web site, information will be 	supplemented with information obtained by consulting with ORD, patient advocacy 	groups, and other experts.  Educational modules will address issues in
?	Sample collection, processing, storage, and distribution. 
?	Privacy and informed consent. 
?	Means that repositories can use to assess their success in fulfilling requests and ways to identify and solve problems that arise.
?	Methods that researchers can use to optimize their ability to obtain human biospecimens for rare diseases research and orphan drug development. 
ANTICIPATED TIMELINE 
This project will be conducted over a two-year period beginning at the time of the award of the contract. REQUIRED Staff:  Project Director and Principal Investigator, Research Programmer, and Research Assistant.

<DESC>C.2.	BACKGROUND:

C.2.1.  The CRP is a Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) program and technical assistance is needed for the implementation of the CRP.  The Secretary of Agriculture has assigned lead program responsibility for the CRP to FSA.  In 2004, the President signed P.L 108-498, a bill that provides independent authority beginning October 1, 2004, for CRP funds to be used for technical assistance to implement the program.  This legislation authorizes FSA to cooperate with and solicit technical service(s) from various Federal agencies, local governments, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals in order to carry out the agency?s roles, responsibilities, and further the conservation mission of FSA on private land(s) enrolled in CRP.

C.2.2.  FSA will now be required to maintain, administer, and monitor technical assistance contracts for CRP. Currently, CRP participants may select technical assistance from a list of individuals certified as Technical Service Providers (TSP?s) and/or the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS).  TSP?s are selected and certified as acceptable providers for use by NRCS.  The goal of this training is to increase FSA staff knowledge of the technical assistance needed in the development of CRP continuous sign-up conservation plans and to oversee contract implementation.  FSA will use this training to develop and/or provide quality control reviews of TSP contracts for CRP continuous sign-up technical assistance.

C.2.3.  Section 1242 also requires the Secretary to establish a system for approving individuals and entities to provide technical assistance to carry out programs under this title including criteria for the evaluation of providers or potential providers of technical assistance.

C.2.4.  Sections 1231-1236 of the Food Security Act 1985, as amended (1985 Act) (16 U.S.C. 3831 -3836), authorizes CRP.  7 CFR Part 1410 provides the regulatory and statutory authority for CRP. 

C.2.5.  The following tasks of this SOW outline the proposed steps that will meet the requirements of both FSA and the requirements set forth for the administration of technical assistance for CRP.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate written request for quotation will not be issued.  

The solicitation number is AG-82FT-S-07-0020 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 531110. 

The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price Contract for lease/rental of a modular, please send e-mail request for complete package.  The contractor will deliver all necessary materials, transport and assemble the buildings, and remove the structure at the end of the lease/rental term.  The structures remain the property of the contractor. 

Awards may not necessarily be made to the quoter submitting the lowest quote.  Also, award may not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that appear to exceed those needed for successful performance of the work.

Quotes should be submitted based on the most favorable terms quoter can make to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all quotes or to make award without conducting discussions.  For the purpose of this Request for Quotation, discussion shall not be considered to have been initiated where the Government requests additional information supplementing or clarifying a quote without materially changing it.

Past performance evaluation will include customer satisfaction, quality of services and timeliness. Quoter must demonstrate performance of similar type, scope, and magnitude to that detailed in this RFQ in the past three years.  Documentation shall include contract numbers, current point of contact, telephone number, e-mail address if available, fax number, description and value of the work.  Quoter is responsible to make their best attempt to assure that past performance information is current so verification can occur.  Information containing contact names no longer at the location provided, disconnected or changed phone numbers, or any other inaccurate information that hinders verifying past performance information runs the risk of the information not being considered.

Technical quality of product offered, past performance including maintenance issues, ability to delivery in a timely manner, are more important than price, however, in the evaluation of offers, when ratings are close, then pricing will become more important to the selection decision.

This contract will include a base year and possibility of four one-year options. There will be no future synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised.  No new work can be issued after one year following award of initial contract unless an option year is exercised.

GSA plans to award this open market contract on a sole source basis to Acteon Networks LLC (GST).  For the past five years, Acteon Networks LLC (GST) has been an integral partner in providing voicemail maintenance services for the location listed previously.  Acteon Networks LLC (GST) has been satisfactorily performing under the existing task order.  The need for this voicemail maintenance support is on-going.  It is very important that there is no break in service for this voicemail system requirement because every Government agency that is involved depends on their telecommunication systems to ensure their continuity of operations and ability to meet their overall missions.

Per FAR 6.302-1, Acteon Networks LLC (GST) is the only known responsible source that can provide these voicemail maintenance services and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  At the end of the period of performance, the Government will conduct further market research to determine if another responsible source has entered the commercial marketplace that would be able to perform these voicemail maintenance services.  If another responsible source is found at that time, then the next contract will be awarded on a competitive basis.

The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  A completed copy of the provision at 52.213-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items shall be included with the quote.  The clause at 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.  The clause at 52..212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  In addition, the provision at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services applies to this acquisition.

Submission of quotes: Quotes shall be e-mailed to Kristin.Markiewicz@gsa.gov by Friday, September 14th at 2:00pm EST.  Award will be made via GSA?s TOPS System.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to:

Solicitation number HSCG38-07-Q-300024 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

These items shall be priced separately for replacement cost if any are determined to be beyond economical repair during the overhaul process. The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders.

High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices.  Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA AND PAST PERFORMANCE

1.	The technical portion of the quote will be the most important single consideration in the award of this contract, and should be as complete and specific as possible.  The evaluation of the quote will be based on the response of the offeror to this request for quote and to the ability demonstrated by the offeror to meet the needs of the project.

2.	The Government will evaluate the quality of the Offeror??s past performance based on information obtained from references provided by the Offeror, as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the Offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.  The assessment of the Offeror??s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the capability of the Offeror.  Thus, an Offeror with an exceptional record of past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than if its record is only acceptable.  Past performance will not be scored, but the Government??s conclusions about overall quality of the Offeror??s past performance will be highly influential in determining the merits of the Offeror??s quote.  By past performance, the Government means the Offeror??s record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the Offeror??s record of forecasting and controlling costs; the Offeror??s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror??s reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror??s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

DEFENSE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AGENCY (DISA)
COMPUTING SERVICES LOGISTICS 

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
BRAND NAME:  MARCONI 
MIPR7LSWITC110

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Section 4202 (10 U.S.C. 2304). 

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity

The requiring activity for this action is 66th MI Group, Dagger Complex, Eberstadterweg, 64295, Darmstadt, Germany. The contracting activity is DISA/DITCO Europe,Building 143, 67681 Sembach-Heuberg, Germany.

2.  Nature/Description of Action

Requirement is for the purchase of MARCONI/ERICSSON Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)(broadband switching and transmission technology) equipment and three year advanced replacement support. A firm-fixed price commercial item type contract is planned and will be issued pursuant to FAR 13.5.  All brand name Marconi resellers who submit offers will be considered for award on a lowest cost, technically acceptable basis.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services

The following ATM equipment is to upgrade current equipment from 10 to 16 GHz and upgrade to the IP protocol:

ITEM	Part Number	Product	QTY
1	BXR1600R/16AC	BXR 1600 Redundant Configuration 	1
2	BXR-SCP-P5-700	BXR400/BXR1600 Pentium 700 MHz Switch Control Processor 	2
3	NM-4/ETH-TXB	4-port 10/100 Ethernet TX network module	4
4	NM-1/622SMIRE	1-port OC-12c/STM-4 Series E ATM network module (single-mode, IR optics)	3
5	FT-BXR1600-PL	FT-BXR Platinum SW - BXR1600	1
	SUPP-S-A	Support, Next Business Day advance replacement	

Estimated dollar value is REDACTED
4.  Identification of Statutory Authority

Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Section 4202 (10 U.S.C. 2304). The Marconi equipment is peculiar to one manufacturer.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.

This ATM equipment is to upgrade current Marconi/Ericsson equipment from 10 to 16 GHz and upgrade to the IP protocol.  All community members are currently trained in the use and maintenance of this equipment. The solution is cost effective for the Government?s utilization of existing equipment. Marconi is the only ATM equipment 5th Signal allows to joint to the Wide Area Network. Purchase of Marconi/Ericsson equipment will enable the Government to reutilize existing line cards being used in the current switch chassis. Purchase of any other vendor would require a complete replacement of all of these line cards resulting in a enormous additional cost to the Government.  In summary, we deem that the purchase of specific brand-name products enables HQ 66th MI Group to simplify support, maintain the Enterprise Infrastructure and meet the operational requirements of the defense intelligence community.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources

The solicitation will be posted on FedBiz Opps.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price

The Contracting Officer will compete the requirement among resellers of Net App equipment on FedBiz Opps.  The price to the Government will be determined fair and reasonable prior to award based upon competition.

8.  Description of Market Research 

Requests for bid were sent to all six ITES-2H vendors: Apptis,  CDWG, Dell, GTSI, IBM, and WWT.  Requests for quote were also sent Marconi Communications Federal, Inc. Market research was conducted on GSA Advantage to receive Independent Government Estimates (IGEs) for the items quoted.  

9.  Supporting Facts

This brand name of equipment is requested to support mandatory software programs, maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the 66th MI Group's mission systems.

10.  Listing of Interested sources: 

The requesting activity used the Army Small Computer Program website to determine interest, as well as contacting other vendors known to be able to supply the required Marconi equipment.  Interested sources include:  Ericcson Federal and GTSI.

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition: 

None.  Use of other than Marconi equipment would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule

The Government anticipates a 30-day delivery period after contractor?s receipt of order.

13.  Reference to Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)

Not applicable.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The NIST Center for Neurtron Research (NCNR) designs, builds, operates and maintains a suite of cold and thermal neutron scattering instrumentation used in the conduct of material structure research.  The instruments which employ cold neutrons for research have the neutrons directed to them via mirrored guides.  The alignment of these guides to one another is critical to achieve the optimum transmission of neutrons.  The alignment of the instruments with respect to the guides is equally important for the collection of scientific data.

The NCNR is under a new expansion directive that will include the construction of a new Guide Hall.  This Guide Hall will house at least four (4) instrument guides.  The Industrial Theodolites will be used to facilitate the alignment of these guides during installation.  The accuracy of the Industrial Theodolites will be key to providing the best possible transmission of neutrons through the guides.  Once the guide network has been established, a variety of scientific instruments will be installed and aligned with respect to individual guides.  The alignment precision of the instruments with respect to the guides is directly correlated with their peak performance.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATIONS 
Questions # 1.  The bid request specifically has (8) and (3) units specified.  Is this a definite/only number required to meet bid specifications or as in the past bid specifications any quantity could be quoted even though the same unit quantities were listed?

Answer:  The end user has identified a quantity they believe will meet or exceed the 400 cfm of airflow.  The government will evaluate any innovative proposal that bids fewer units but still meets or exceeds this requirement.  A site visit is being offered, which provides contractors the opportunity to submit a proposal to meet or exceed the airflow requirement.

Questions # 2.  One of the specifications lists an air flow of ?400 cfm? which is not an accepted industry standard for diesel exhaust removal systems.  Is this spec correct or a minimum specification for reference only?

Answer:  There is no error with this specification.  This standard was derived from MacDill AFB?s Bioenvironmental Flight and the 25th Edition of the Industrial Ventilation Manual (Guidelines MacDill AFB must follow).

NOTE# 1:  The only technical evaluation will be if the proposal meets or exceeds the 400 cfm.  No other information will be considered.

NOTE# 2.  The deadline for submitting requests for clarifications is 7 Sep 07, 4 p.m. EST.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Los Angeles North Airfield Study, Solicitation No. NNA07214057Q-AMJ which was posted on August 9, 2007. You are notified that the following changes are made:  Major Tasks to be performed, parts 2 and 6 shall read as follows: 2)	Identify the underlying causes of runway incursions at LAX, the role of existing airline fleet serving LAX, and assess the severity of the problem considering future traffic requirements and configuration options.  Address potential reasons why the South Airfield has historically been subject to substantially more runway incursions than the North Airfield.  This requires the review of Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) reports and other sources of Runway Incursion data for the past 20 years, considering only major incidents for those older than 10 years. 6)	Report on the role of human error and air traffic control tower staffing in the risk of runway incursion referencing existing studies on this subject.	This should be a focused study and discussion of specific errors and related human factors that directly influence the safety of LAX operations.  Constructive recommendations for reduction of contributing factors should be included. The due date for responses is extended to September 10, 2007 Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR PART 13.105 AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS IS A SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. 

The Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental health Services Administration requires a contractor to provide creating trainig materials for consumers, family members, and providers on developing peer support approaches for persons with co-occurring mental health, substance abuse problems, and somatic/physical health ailments.

Background:

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) was created in 1992 to work in partnership with States to improve prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals with mental illness and substance abuse disorders. SAMHSA?s Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) provides national leadership for mental health service delivery improvements. One of SAMHSA?s stated priorities is in the area of mental health transformation.

Mental health transformation responds to the recommendations put forth by the 2003 final report of the President?s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, "Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America." Specifically, the commission cited that people with co-occurring disorders are inadequately served.  Further the commission cited as a primary goal the need for mental health care to be consumer and family driven.

Peer support approaches to serve people with co-occurring mental health and substance abuse problems have been cited as a promising practice.  These approaches, such as Double Trouble in Recovery, Dual Recovery Anonymous, and Dual Disorders Anonymous, can provide valuable support and assistance in promoting recovery.  There is a clear need for information on how such approaches can be developed in counties and states.

In addition, there is a need for information on how peer support approaches could assist in the needs of persons with mental illness with co-occurring physical or somatic illnesses.  This is particularly crucial given the high rates of early mortality and co-morbidity for people with mental illnesses.

	ANSWER:  No ? All speakers reside locally.

27.	QUESTION:  2(ii) in the SOW says, "the length of the other three sessions shall
	be four non-consecutive days during Monday through Friday." Does this mean
	there will be a total of 12 meetings for the Fall, Winter, and Spring sessions? 


	ANSWER:  Training will be scheduled during each one-week period on 	Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  Training on Thursday will be on 	the USUHS campus therefore no hotel facility will be needed on Thursday

	There will be 3 scheduled sessions scheduled one in the fall, one in the winter and 	one in the spring each year FY08.  It is anticipated that, at minimum, this will be 	the same schedule in the ensuing years.

<DESC>Amendment 0002 - This modification is issued to answer questions. Q: According to the factory, the drawing (714783) you mentioned does not show the flexures.Attached is the top drawing of the standard 4022 showing the four flexures. Doesn't your unit look like this? A: The drawing number should have been 714784. The drawing 714784 and the YPG exciter armature has eight flexures total. I believe the questions become part of the statement of work. In any case, before award please confirm that the new armature is the eight flexure configuration.

<DESC>1. Amendment 0001 is hereby incorporated into the Request for Quote (RFQ) number W912JF-07-T-0023 and shall become a part of any resultant contract. 2. The questions and answers were either submitted prior to or during the site visit. Question 1.  Page 4, third paragraph of the solicitation states in pertinent part that the  State Licensing Agency (SLA) will be afforded paramount priority of a 10% preference for consideration of award. Concern: Paragraph b. (1)(b), page 2, and page 20, paragraph of AR 210-25 specifies If the State Licensing Agency submits a proposal and it i s within the competitive range established by the contracting office, the contract will be awarded to the State Licensing Agency. The Arkansas State Licensing Agency understands that the latter priority cited in AR 210-25 has not changed nor has the Rando lph-Sheppard Act. Please clarify.  Answer: According to the Randolph-Sheppard, SLA shall be given a priority award of contracts to operate cafeterias.   In this case the Government has assigned a 10% preference, based on other social economic priorities allowed by the FAR.    All quotes wil l be evaluated to see if they are acceptable based on the factors listed in the solicitation.  If the SLAs quote is acceptable it will be evaluated based on the competitive range established by the Contracting Officer and the 10% preference.  Question 2.  Paragraph 2.4 states that All contract personnel must approve of a police record check to be accomplished before working at Fort Chaffee.  What exactly is the government looking for here?  Is the contractor supposed to run a police record ch eck on all employees?  Will the government be paying for the police record check?  Who determines the records checks, if they are satisfactory or not?  Answer:The contractor is responsible to ensure a nationwide criminal background (e.g. National Crime Information Center / NCIC) check is conducted on all employees (e.g. primary contractor and subcontractor employees) who will be working on Fort Chaffee.    Any felony convictions or series of misdemeanors offenses will be justification for the Contracting Officer to deny access to Fort Chaffee. Contractor shall provide Contracting Officer a letter stating that the background checks have been completed and notify the Contractor Officer of any exceptions.     Question 3.  Paragraph 2.15 states Contractor employees will be allowed one Government provided meal per eight hour shift.  Please clarify this sentence.  Does this mean that a contract employee is provided a free meal or that they are authorized to purc hase and eat one meal a day? Answer: Contracting Employees will receive one free meal per eight hour shift.  These meals shall not be counted against the government.   Question 4.  Paragraph 3.3 states The contractor shall obtain foods from Government for each meal and accomplish the food preparation in accordance with the recipe, 12 day menus and the USDA Food Code.  How will the contractor obtain these foods?  Is a v ehicle required? Will the government furnish the vehicles if needed?  How many days rations can be held at the dining facility? Answer: As stated in the Statement of Work, the food shall be delivered and stored at the dinning facility.  Government shall provide a warehouse forklift to offload the food.  Contractor shall provide the driver.  There is additional space available for s torage in case of overflow. Prime Vendor can deliver to alternate storage space if needed.  Contractor shall be responsible for transporting supplies from alternate storage space.  Government served over 70,000 in a 30 day period in the present facility in  June 2007.  Meals peaked at over 4,300 per day.   Additional storage facility was used once during this period. The dinning facility has a storage room capable of holding a three day supply of dry goods, two walk-in refrigerators, and a walk-in freezer. Question 5.  Paragraph 4.2 describes ro utine bussing of tables.  Will the diners clear there own diningware and, if so, will the contractor only be responsible for the occasional removal of eating utensils, dinnerware, and trash left by careless diners? Answer: Yes. Question 6.  Paragraph 12.2 states that &Extensions of the service timeframe shall be compensated at a rate for every 15 minutes.   With the units in the CLINs in lump sums how will rate for 15 minute periods be developed?  Should there be a CLIN for Ext ended Services with units being quarter hours? Answer: Hours shall not be extended at the dinning facility. Remove Extensions of the service timeframe shall be compensated at a rate for every 15 minutes from the statement of work.  Question 7.  Paragraph 14.6 states that The contractor will be furnished an initial issue of GFP.  Can offerors be provided a list of that equipment?  Will all pots, pans, serving utensils etc be provided by the government? Answer: List of equipment will be provided to contractor after the award. Government shall provide Contractor with pots, pans, and serving utensils. Question 8.  Paragraph 17.1 states that To-Go plates should also be provided?  Is the government talking about the typical clam shell Styrofoam containers?  What is the estimated quantity expected for To-Go plates/orders? Answer: The Government anticipates no To-Go orders, however if there is an exception, the contractor may serve the food on the three compartment plate as described in paragraph 5.2 of the SOW. Question 9. We noticed that the FBO announcement shows this as a Mess Attendant equirement, but the PWS you sent makes it appear as a Full Food Service.  Which is correct?  I know there are line items for both to fill out, but we request clarification. Answer: The Government is providing food subsistence in this requirement, which is why the description is written this way.  Also Line 0001 is for all the requirements listed in the Statement of Work for food preparation and serving.  The remaining service s listed in the Statement of Work should be quoted in Line 0002. Question 10. To help clarify this issue, below we provide a list of the following and hopefully you can tell us who provides what: Refrigeration thermometers,  pocket thermometers, knives (cooking type) boning, French, slicing, paring etc. grill thermometers,  oven Thermometers,  hot pads,  aluminum foil, saran wrap, food labels, brooms, mops handles,  mop heaps, mop buckets, toilet bowl brush, pot scrubber brush , gill pad holder, grill screen. Answer: Government will provide knives (cooking type) Boning, French, slicing, paring etc. Government will also provide refrigeration thermometers and oven thermometers.  Contractor shall provide other supplies needed to set-up their operations at the dinn ing facility.  Question 11: What was the cost per meal on the last contract awarded by the Government for Fort Chaffee?   Answer: The cost per meal was $2.24.  The contractor served over 70,000 meals during a 30 day period.  Daily meals served peaked at over 4,600 meals per day.  Contractor followed same menu and similar statement of work.    Question 12: Will the short order breakfast cook be required to prepare omelets? Can the cook prepare the omelets in advance? Answer:  No short order cook will be required for breakfast.  Omelets are not required. Question 13: How much time will the contractor have to prepare the facility for inspection after completing the contract?  What are the cleaning expectations, regarding the completion of the contract? Answer: As specified in the SOW, Contractor has up to two days. Contractor does not have to use the full two days to clean-up.  Dinning facility should be in the same condition as it was prior to the contract. Question 14: Can the contractor substitute or make additions to the menu? What happens to the leftovers? Answer: Contractor may make suggestions and requests for additional subsis tence or spices to improve the quality of the meal. There is nothing in place for leftovers at time. The process for leftovers will be referred to the Government COR or QAE. Question 15: Does the kitchen have air conditioning? Answer: No, there are some fans in the facility. Government will try to provide fans, however we would recommend bringing fans. Question 16: Can the contractor bring his/her own trailer and equipment? Answer: Yes, however equipment must be removed when the contract is completed. For example, there is a requirement for steaks on the menu.  Government will provide an outside grill.  Contractor may choose to bring an additional grill to handle overflow.  N ote: Government will not be responsible for contractors equipment. Question 17: Is the contractor required to provide eating utensils (knife, fork, or spoon)? Answer: Yes as stated in the SOW. Contractor shall also provide salad bowls. Note: Contactor should be washing primarily pots, pans, and serving utensils. Patrons will police themselves by picking up their own trash and throwing it away on their way out. Question 18: Will the forecasted number of meals change?  Answer: All numbers are estimates at this time.  The overall number should not change.  However, the number of meals per period may vary.    Question 19: Will the government send dining patrons in stages to eat? Answer: Most of the patrons should arrive at the beginning hours of the shift. Please refer to Statement of Work, Paragraph 5.3 for guidance on serving lines. Question 20: May the contractor arrive earlier than 2-3 days prior to the start of the contract?   Answer: Please refer to Statement of Work, Paragraph 1.0.   Question 21: Will there be an additional requirement for food service? Answer: None are forecast at this time.   Question 22: How will cash and MREs be handled? Answer: Contractor shall handle no cash.  MREs will be self-issued and Contractor will have to coordinate the delivery and set-up with the COR.  Contractor shall set up boxes for issue and remove empty boxes as needed. Question 23: What are the salad requirements? Does the contractor needed to provide coffee filters? Does the contractor need to bring pots and pans?  Answer: Please refer to Statement of Work, Paragraph 3.3 for guidance on food preparation. Government shall provide coffee filters. Government shall provide pots and pans for cooking.   Question 24: Can the contractor vary from the menu? For example; can the contractor modify the gravy recipe? Answer:  No.  Please refer to Statement of Work, Paragraph 3.3 for guidance on food preparation. Question 25: How many trucks do you think the contractor should lease to move supplies from the overflow?  How many employees should the contractor hire per shift or use on the line?  Answer:  The contractor needs to make these determinations based on the statement of work and meal schedule.  Question 26: Are the Belson WS-4 hand washing stations suitable?  Answer:  Yes, however the Government is not requiring any specific brand of hand wash stations.  Note: There are four doors to the dinning facility.  Government stated 3-4 stations per door at the site visit, however the contractor should make this determi nation based on the flow of patrons going into the dinning facility during the peak periods.  4. The closing date for submission of offers will remain as September 7, 2007 at 11:00 AM CST.
