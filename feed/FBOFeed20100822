<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
POINT OF CARE REHABILITATION MEDICINE PRODUCT

A.	General Information
1.0		Introduction:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires an existing commercial off the shelf web based, Point of Care Rehabilitation Medicine Product that will be made available throughout the VHA healthcare system.  

For the purpose of this solicitation, these products may also be referred to as bedside information tools because they have been designed to provide information at the patient's bedside or point of care.  They tend to provide information that will directly affect patient care. They can be a good source for background information. What distinguishes these products from sources such as electronic textbooks or bibliographic citations databases that may link to full text is this emphasis on point-of-care, patient-oriented information. These products are distinctly different from text-based, point-of-care sources such as printed guidelines: these electronic resources are updated much more frequently than print resources and provide tools for easily searching and sharing information.

Currently most VA Medical Centers and/or VISNs (Veterans Integrated Services Networks) license at least one Point of Care Rehabilitation Medicine Product, but there is no one product available to all VHA staff on an enterprise basis.  VHA's goal is to insure uniform availability of a high quality, clinical, knowledge based resource across the VHA system to improve clinical decision making at the point of care.

Performance Period: One year award plus 4 (1 year) option years. 

1.1	Objectives

The desired goals of the nationwide provision of a commercial Point of Care Rehabilitation Medicine Products are as follows:

1.1.1	Providing access nationwide to standard knowledge based clinical information resources available at the point of care, will build on the enterprise wide availability of the web based version Psychiatry Online, Lexi-Comp Online for Dentistry, and ACP PIER Plus.

1.1.2	Initiating a nationwide, centralized purchase to capitalize on the economies of scale offered by vendors.  

1.1.3	Negotiating one license/contract to decrease the current contracting and reviewing efforts that are required at the facility and/or VISN level and thereby avoid the costs and workload associated with multiple procurements.

1.1.4	Making this Point of Care Rehabilitation Medicine Product available through CPRS (Computerized Patient Record System), the VA's Electronic Health Record, nationwide to insure consistent access at the bedside for all VHA health professionals and staff.

1.1.5	This SOW is not intended for a general medicine point of care product but one instead specifically in the Rehabilitation Medicine discipline.


2.0	Scope of Work:

2.0.1	The vendor will provide all sites on the VHA network with access to a single online, web-based product.  Authentication will be through IP address validation on an enterprise basis, eliminating the need for users to enter identification, username and/or password.  


2.0.2	An unrestricted number of simultaneous users are to have immediate access from any web-enabled computer within VHA. It is required that all authorized remote users with VPN access have access to the product.

2.1	Information Scope

The product should include:

2.1.1	Consult-level summaries and topics covering rehabilitation medicine, occupational therapy, and physical therapy in a format suitable for use by students, house staff, occupational therapists, physical therapists and other point of care health providers.   

2.1.2	Topics that reflect current practice issues and support clinical decision support.

2.1.3	Drug information

2.1.4	Comprehensive information in a single product available for stand-alone purchase or license, independent of complementary or companion products offered by the vendor. 

2.1.5	Related patient education material.


2.2	Information Quality

 
2.2.1	Information is accurate, authoritative, and relevant

2.2.2	Authors and sources are well recognized subject experts in their fields.  

2.2.3	Topics are presented succinctly, but with adequate detail to be useful to clinicians.

2.2.4	"Best practice" or evidence-based information is included in recommendations for diagnosis or therapy.

2.2.5	Policies for determining validity and standards for inclusion of material are well described.

2.2.6	Guidelines and summaries include references or sources.

2.2.7	When necessary to the topic, images, tables and diagrams are available and clearly shown. 

2.3	Usability

2.3.1	Navigation within the system is logical and is easy to use. There is fast access to topics and subtopics. Topic linking or indexing retrieves material of high relevance quickly.  


2.3.2	The product has "user friendly" help and direction aids.

2.3.3	Athens authentication access compatible.


2.4	Currency

2.4.1	Content areas are updated on a continuous, incremental cycle rather than on a single anniversary date for the entire product. 

2.4.2	The date a topic was last reviewed for content is stated and easily found.


2.5  	Access, content, support

  

2.5.1	Product is 508 compliant. (http://www.section508.gov/)

<DESC>This notice is to all parties expressing an interest in the United States Secret Service (USSS) Request For Information HSSS01-09-RFI-0001 "Block 1: IT Infrastructure Modernization, Database Architecture and Maintenance and Cyber Security" (Block 1) initiative posted October 16, 2009 on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) and the subsequent FBO Special Notice titled "Information Integration and Transformation - Pre-Block One - Study, Analysis and Stabilization" posted March 5, 2010 under solicitation number HSSS01-10-J-0041. The HSSS01-10-J-0041 solicitation envisioned an acquisition via the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) EAGLE contract that would provide the USSS with a study, analysis and equipment stabilization effort. This solicitation was subsequently cancelled, but with the expectation that the Government's needs would be fulfilled by other methods.<br />
<p><br />The USSS currently expects to perform multiple predecessor acquisitions in advance of the complete initiative. The purpose of these separate tasks will be the rapid acquisition of hardware and software elements and their installation, configuration and integration into the current USSS IT infrastructure. These acquisitions are to ensure that current IT assets continue to function effectively and seamlessly while the remainder of the initiative proceeds through the various phases of the acquisition process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These initial predecessor acquisitions are presently planned to be conducted via an existing U.S. Government acquisition vehicle for efficiency purposes. Current expectations are to conduct these separate tasks via the DHS FirstSource contract vehicle. This notice is provided as guidance only for the information of interested parties and is subject to change. Additional FirstSource contract information, including contract awardees' information, may be found at:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://www.dhs.gov/xopnbiz/opportunities/gc_1249920282614.shtm</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USSS continues to plan for the IT Infrastructure Modernization, Database Architecture and Maintenance and Cyber Security initiative to be acquired via an anticipated unrestricted open market acquisition conducted via FBO. The USSS encourages interested parties to frequently monitor FBO for future notices of the complete initiative.</p>

The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not
accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and
remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or
division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in
performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the
responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its
intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of
subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the
responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient
documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this
clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the
absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information
that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be
considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment"
paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual
payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment
of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in
the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments,
including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be
considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment"
paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 	(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual
confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423

adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this
contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the
payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under the Act until certified. A voucher,
invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim

the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability
or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a
written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written
decision by the Contracting Officer.

that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that
the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor
believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of
the Contractor."
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For
Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide
the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officer's decision shall be final unless the contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the
Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use
alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor
shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor's specific reasons for rejecting
the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that
payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to
claims having defective certifications, as defined in (FAR) 48 CFR 33.201, interest shall be paid
from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims
shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the ACT, which is
applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the
rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency
of the claim.
(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.

percent of the total amount of work to be performed under the contract.
