<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the 55th Contracting Squadron to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing engineering and technical services for maintenance, enhancements and development of the Air Vehicle Planning System (APS) application for United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC), and DET 1, 608TH Air Operations Group (AOG).  APS is an air vehicle mission-planning tool with a graphical user interface and database (i.e. uses USSTRATCOM’s Enterprise Database (EDB)) capable of planning the air vehicle missions supporting USSTRATCOM and United States Air Force missions.  A sample of the air vehicles included are the B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers; KC-135 and KC-10 tankers; U-2, EP-3, and RC-135C reconnaissance aircraft; Dual-Capable F-15 and F-16 aircraft; Air Launched Cruise Missiles; Advanced Cruise Missiles; and Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missiles.  APS’ approximate 6.5 million lines of software code have been developed in languages such as FORTRAN, PL/1, C, and C++.  The size of the database is approximately one terabyte.  APS provides interactive graphical displays supporting air vehicle routing; route conflict resolutions, reconnaissance objective acquisition analysis, threat and weapon effect analysis, and timing plan development.  APS interfaces with the Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS), Mission Data Planning System (MDPS), and other USSTRATCOM and/or Joint systems.  The possible (or potential) enhancements are not limited to the following: improvement by modernizing and upgrading the software per the USSTRATCOM System and Technical Architecture Documents; migration toward a thin client environment; support for Theater Planning; EDB updates; reengineering to reduce legacy languages; improve performance of the application; modernization and integration with Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) Systems, transition planning functions to other DoD systems (i.e. Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS)) and increase inter-operability with current and future mission planning systems.  The contractor must maintain a TOP SECRECT and Special Access Required (SAR) facility clearance with storage capacity for TOP SECRET and SAR documents and equipment.  Contractor personnel who work on APS must have a favorable SSBI within the past five years for TOP SECRET and specific SAR clearances and be cleared for SIOP/ESI and Special Compartmentalized Information (SCI)) access.

<DESC>NOTE:  In accordance with the Agreement of Defense and Cooperation between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America, any contract resulting from this notice/solicitation can only be entered into with companies authorized to carry out these activities in Spain under Spanish law.  Companies must meet the requirements established by Spanish legislation for execution of Government works.  Obtaining a license or permission to operate your company in Spain may be a long process; therefore, any company anticipating interest in future projects should immediately begin the processes that will be required, by contacting the Delegation of Industry.  They have two offices; one in the Madrid province and one in the Andalucia province.  The telephone numbers are: 011 34 91 580 2100 (Madrid) and 011 34 95 507 8620 for Andulucia.  The Air Force intends to solicit proposals for a Firm-Fixed Price contract on the Runway Rubber Removal Project (QUUG 03-2008).  Contract magnitude is between $100,000 and $250,000.  The successful contractor will be selected using Past Performance/Price tradeoff (PPPT) procedures resulting in the best value to the Government.  Past Performance will be rated significantly higher than price.  You are requested to notify the contracting officer, thomas.finch@moron.af.mil if you intend to download the solicitation.  It is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this pre-solicitation notice and or any other postings published by our office.  However, remember that the notification of changes that result from registration is only a service and any failure of the service to notify you of changes cannot be used against the Government in any way, shape, or form.  Therefore, you should check EPS frequently for any new postings that may have been made.  As a last resort, if you cannot download the pre-solicitation from the EPS internet site, we can provide a CD ROM Disk, however, you must provide at least two working day notice (workdays are Monday through Friday except Spanish and American holidays) of your request for a CD ROM Disk to the above e-mail address or via fax at 95 584 8054.

<DESC>The 53d Wing, Air Combat Command, at Eglin AFB, Florida,  plans to contract for a consultant, who, along with a proven software tool, can assist the Wing in implementing Theory of Constraints (TOC) Project Management  to plan and manage the test projects we under take each year, throughout the Wing’s 19 geographic locations. The 53d Wing is one of the most diverse wings in the U.S. Air Force, with responsibilities including operational test and evaluation of armament and avionics, aircrew training devices, chemical defense, aerial reconnaissance improvements and electronic warfare systems.  The wing conducts the weapons system evaluation programs for air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons.  It also conducts the Electronic Warfare Assessment Program.  The 53d Wing comprises four groups, numbers more than 1,800 military and civilians at 19 locations throughout the United States.  The wing owns and operates more than 50 aircraft of 12 different types, 150 drones, and 5 boats.  Each year, the wing’s 40 to 60 test teams conduct about 200 operational tests.    The 53d Wing Test Management Group (TMG) is the focal point within 53d Wing for implementing the TOC program, and does so under the direct auspices of the Wing Command Section.  As part of this implementation, we expect to stand up a TOC Steering Group at the Wing/Group level to drive the change, make course corrections, and harvest lessons-learned from the pilot project.  We intend for TOC to become the fundamental management philosophy used at 53d Wing to identify our constraining resources, elevate those resources, increase test throughput, and ensure the most efficient use of people and funds. Our TOC implementation strategy envisions a 6-month, 20-person, 20-test project, pilot project to establish TOC’s utility in an Electronic Warfare Group (EWG) and TMG division.  We expect the pilot project to be followed by an 18 month Wing-wide rollout of TOC project management.  The scope of the Wing rollout includes approximately 100 project managers at two primary locations (Eglin AFB and Nellis AFB, Nevada), with the remainder of the team members being geographically dispersed among other Wing locations.  Wing-wide we expect the roll-out to support 40 to 60 simultaneous test teams comprising approximately 500 people, and approximately 150-200 test projects a year.  During the Wing roll-out, we expect to become self-sufficient in training teams in TOC, planning and managing projects, and monitoring project status through the Wing leadership.  Following the roll out, we expect to license the TOC implementation software on an annual basis. Realization Incorporated, 2 North 1st Street, San Jose CA is the only known contractor that can meet the 53d Wing’s interface and schedule requirements. The 53d requirement is for proven TOC consultants combined with a demonstrated off-the-shelf software tool, who can assist the Wing in making the change to TOC in a short period of time (18-24 months), leaving the Wing self sufficient in nonproprietary training courseware, experienced instructors, and seasoned project managers.  The successful offeror must be capable of succeeding in a military flight test environment and supply a tool that is interoperable with Microsoft Project and Realization’s Concerto software currently being used by both AFFTC and AFOTEC.  The successful offeror must be able to demonstrate successful past performance on similar efforts for a minimum of three years with a goal of more than five years experience.  The contract type for the pilot project and Wing roll-out is expected to be a 24 month base contract with firm fixed price task ordering provisions.  The first two tasks are expected to be the pilot project and the Wing roll-out. Following TOC implementation, we expect to award a  firm fixed price contract for the annual software license.   

Technical Requirements.  	
TOC Implementation Strategy.  The contractor shall devise and present to the Wing leadership, a strategy to introduce the Theory of Constraints to members of the 53d Wing.   Upon approval, the contractor shall implement this strategy.   

TOC Pilot Project.  The contractor shall implement a pilot project in a Wing-selected division.  This pilot project shall demonstrate the benefits and implementation strategy for TOC in the Wing’s OT&E test projects.  The pilot project shall have scope of 6-10 project managers, 20 projects and approximately 10 test teams comprising a total of about 20 people..  The duration of the pilot project is expected to be 6 months.

Wing Rollout.  Upon successful conclusion of the pilot project, and at the Wing’s option -- —depending on whether the pilot project has demonstrated the objectives of this effort,  the contractor shall assist the Wing in extending TOC to all Wing units.   The estimated duration of the Wing roll-out is 18 months following the pilot project phase.  

TOC Implementation Software.  The contractor shall provide full use of their TOC software to 53d Wing to include upgrades, patches, and all modules required to support a multi-project implementation of TOC PM for approximately 10 initial teams and ultimately, approximately 75 geographically distributed teams. The software, both stand-alone modules and server/Web components, must be capable of being loaded and run off-the-shelf on the Wing’s computing environment:   Microsoft  Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6.0, Microsoft Outlook 2003, Microsoft Project 2003, and to interface with Microsoft SQL Server 2003 databases.  

Implementation Support.  The contractor shall provide the necessary support for implementing the change to TOC.  This support includes but is not limited to conducting buy-in sessions, developing policy recommendations, building networks, developing roles and responsibilities within the organization, conducting review meetings, and helping resolve issues that arise during implementation.  

Training.  The contractor shall provide training to support the implementation.  Training shall include project manager training, resource training, financial manager training, leadership training, system administration training, and master scheduler training.  The contractor shall supply courseware for these training courses to the Wing for our unrestricted use.  The contractor instructors shall support Wing-selected government trainers as they begin to teach these courses following the pilot project.

Technical Support.  The contractor shall provide technical support as required during the period of performance of the SOW.  Though 53d Wing plans to maintain the software to the greatest extent possible, lack of expertise may require support from the contractor.  Technical support includes telephone support, problem analysis, and on-site problem resolution as required to keep the software operational for the affected organization.

Contact and Response Information.  Interested firms who believe that they can supply the requested products and services should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) within 15 days of this announcement.

<DESC>DoDDS-P requires school bus security attendant services to oversee the security and further the safety of U.S. dependent children when they make their daily commute to and from school on contracted buses in the DoDDS-P operations area.  It requires task-qualified, professionally trained security attendants who accompany and supervise children when they board, ride and exit from the school bus.  Focus is primarily on the exterior environment of the bus routes and stops to detect and report indicators of surveillance, or suspicious, unusual, or apparent criminal activities directed at the bus and its occupants.  The services also include assisting bus drivers in conducting pre-run visual inspections of buses for indicators of tampering or presence of explosive devices,  responding to emergencies, for example, by directing the driver to divert from the route to fire/rescue, medical, or police assistance, or to a safe haven, or by activating a duress alarm signal on the bus; and promote on board student safety by correcting on-the-spot acts or behavior by students that are unsafe or that interfere with safe operation of the bus.    BSAP's companion initiative is the separately contracted Automated Vehicle Locator (AVL) program with installed  Global Positioning System equipment on DoDDS-P school buses, affording both position tracking and duress alarm signaling capabilities.  Security services include operating AVL's duress alarm and assisting DoDDS-P Student Transportation Office (STO) personnel in monitoring AVL base stations for duress alarm signals. 

DoDDS-Pacific's Bus Security Attendant Program (BSAP) responds to the fact that U.S. dependent children require increased security and safety measures when they ride school buses in DoDDS-P's overseas environment.  Terrorism is the first concern, along with crime, emergencies (e.g., civil unrest/disorder) and overall student safety due to the overseas operations environment.  BSAP establishes a common baseline of pro-active threat awareness, detection and deterrence, emergency response and safety support.

1.0	INTRODUCTION:  This Statement of Work defines the tasks for inspection and repair of electric fuel pump part number 2060A12.

2.0    BACKGROUND: The electric fuel pump is required for transferring aviation turbine fuel from the aircraft integral fuel tanks to the aircraft engine feeder tanks in the USCG HU-25 aircraft.  Specified Time Between Inspections (TBI) for this pump is 2000 hours IAW 1U-25A-2 chapter 05.  Typical failure of these pumps is due to worn bearings, electrical contact brushes, and/or damaged commutator assemblies.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plans to solicit proposals from qualified businesses to provide resources to support the Clinical Trials Network (CTN).  The contract will provide data management and statistical analysis services in support of multi-site clinical trials conducted within the NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN).  No actual clinical trials will be carried out under this contract.  Rather, activities under this contract will support the trials carried out under cooperative agreements (U-10) with seventeen Regional Research and Training Centers (RRTCs) located across the nation.  The trial studies include behavior, pharmacological, and integrated therapies in Community-based Treatment Programs (CTPs).  The range of support services encompasses the following areas:
1)	establishing and administering systems for the collection, management and storage of study data;
2)	designing and performing all statistical analyses;
3)	reviewing and monitoring the quality of study data;
4)	monitoring trial progress;
5)	preparing reports for the Data and Safety Monitoring Board;
6)	providing support for protocol development in the areas related to the tasks specified in the Statement of Work;
7)	participating in relevant committee and subcommittee meetings and conference calls; and,
8)	providing other expert consultation and support services as needed. 

We anticipate the award of one cost reimbursement contract for a base period of three years.  The contract will include two 1-year options plus additional options to cover an increase in the number of RRTCs in the network.  NIDA anticipates substantial subcontracting opportunities under this project.  RFP No. N01DA-5-2207 will be available electronically on or about November 19, 2004.  You will access the RFP through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NIDA website: (URL: http://www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html).

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with the Center for Health Statistics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, 1601 W. Taylor, Chicago, IL 60614, for services for the “Evaluation of the Added-value of Multi-dimensional and Hierarchical Psychometric Modeling for Cancer Outcomes Measurement”.  Under 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR citation 6.302-1, the Center for Health Statistics at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is  the only source with the pre-requisite experience to complete this procurement.  The reason for this justification for other than full and open competition is due to UIC’s unique expertise in applied multi-dimensional and hierarchical (including the bi-factor model) methods for modeling health outcomes data (with ordinal response items) for multiple applications including computerized-adaptive testing.  In addition, they have developed the only software program that estimates the full-information bi-factor model parameters for ordinal response data.
 
The primary purpose of this contract is to assess the value of utilizing multi-dimensional models and hierarchical psychometric models for improving measurement of cancer patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to create both a profile of scores as well as an overall summary score, as compared to more standard approaches used in PRO measurement.  The two overarching goals of the work proposed are to examine the added-value, over traditional uni-dimensional approaches, of: 1) multi-dimensional item response theory models to improve the precision of measurement of PRO sub-domains borrowing information from other correlated sub-domains; and 2) hierarchical models (including the bi-factor model for ordinal data) to estimate a summary score that takes into account the precision of and relationship among various sub-domains underlying the higher order construct measured by the scale. This study will use both real ordinal-response data and simulated data to determine the limits of these methods in terms of evaluating the robustness and trustworthiness of item parameters and scores given varying sample sizes and correlations among domains.  Further, the strengths of these complex methods will be considered for various PRO assessment strategies including computerized-adaptive testing (CAT).  The contractor will produce a didactic workbook that describes the methodology, various models’ strengths and limitations for different datasets and PRO applications, input and output software code, and several examples of applying these methods in cancer outcomes data.  Further, the contractor will deliver a publishable manuscript and presentation that summarizes key findings.  

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The contractor must also demonstrate knowledge and research experience in the field of psychometric modeling in health outcomes research and be able to deliver the same superior products.  Contractors should also reference recently published papers in peer-reviewed journals on the subject of multi-dimensional item response theory (IRT) modeling, bi-factor analysis, and CAT in health measurement.  It will be important for the contractor to be able to produce both written and presentation materials to articulate the complex methods to a cancer outcomes research audience.  Information furnished should not exceed 10 pages.  Responses should be submitted electronically to Cynthia D. Washington, Contracting Officer, at cwashing@mail.nih.gov in either WordPerfect or Microsoft Word or fax to (301) 402-8579 by June 20, 2005 at 2:00pm local time.  The NAICS Code is 541910.  See Numbered Note 22.

OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED.  THEREFORE OFFERORS INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERMS.  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction and repair by design-build or design-bid-build of Petroleum Fuel, Oil, and Lubricant Facilities and Systems at various locations within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility, including but not limited to, the continental United States and Alaska.  The work will be for fuel, petroleum, oil and lubricant dispensing, distribution and storage systems, monitoring, leak detection, security and containment systems, tanks, piping, and fueling hydrant repairs, minor buildings, site work and utilities necessary to provide fully functional fuels facilities.  The North American Industry Code Standard is 237120 and the annual size standard is $28.5 million.  In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (Architect-Engineer) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract.  In an effort to avoid a potential conflict of interest, Offerors are encouraged to offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.      After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months.  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months.  For each contract, the estimated maximum dollar value over the base year and all four option periods combined is $30,000,000.  Task orders will range between $50,000 and $3,000,000.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $25,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  Factor 1 - Past Performance of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 2 – Support of Small Business; Factor 3 - Experience of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 4 – Technical Approach/Key Personnel/MACC Project Management/Bonding Capacity; and Factor 5 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  The recommended subcontracting goals for the contract value (base and all options periods) are as follows: 7% - Woman-Owned Small Business; 7% - Small Disadvantaged Business; 3.1% - HUBZone Small Business; 3% - Veteran-Owned Small Business; 3% - Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; - and 25% Other Small Business.  Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  Proposed Task Order (PTO) 0001 is to provide all material, labor and equipment necessary to construct the Fuel System Icing Inhibitor (FSII).  This PTO is representative of the projects that may be procured through this contract.  The estimated price range for Task Order 0001 is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The Government reserves the right to award a single contract for the performance of the Proposed Task Order identified in the RFP (Proposed Task Order 0001) only.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) with University Research Glassware (URG) Corporation of Chapel Hill, North Carolina for one ICS-2000 System with Degas, Chromeleon 6.60 for ion chromatography measurements. This instrument is a central and essential component of the suite of mercury measurement instruments in operation at Mauna Loa Observatory that allow for the measurements of trace concentrations of mercury flowing from Asia and has been proven to be the most sensitive available for this requirement. This instrument will be identical to others used in a global mercury network that relies upon accurate, consistent and intercomparable measurements with the same instrument suites, operated in a same manner, to determine atmospheric mercury concentrations at very low concentrations. Since mercury in the atmosphere may soon be controlled, all mercury measurements in this network must be conducted with identical instruments in an identical manner by people trained in a similar manner. This notice is for information purposes only. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government’s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. No RFQ package is available. This procurement is being conducted per Simplified Acquisition Procedures FAR Part 13.1. Terms and conditions and agency level protest procedures are referenced at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/subpart_33_1.html#1046527.  Hard copy in full text is available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  The anticipated award date is May 18, 2005.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) No. D03029. These solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The North American Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611. The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Herbert Z. Wong & Associates for consulting services in order to provide three (3) two-day workshop sessions for approximately 18-20 participants per session on “Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace” to accommodate fifty-eight (58) employees within the Office of Management (OM), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). This training will incorporate analysis from the CDER Cultural Survey’s completion and comparisons shall be made for this Diversity training in order to provide management necessary tools and information to help with the current management changes. The contractor will review these previous organizational survey results, including the Survey of Organizations, exit interviews, quality of work-life survey results and elements of the Human Capital Standards for Success and High Performing Organization standards that will assist the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) in analyzing and interpreting the inclusive and comprehensive survey instrument that is now in place. The objectives of these workshops are to: 1) Present and illustrate the communication dynamics that facilitate awareness and understanding among people within a diverse work environment (as well as the dynamics that cause misunderstanding); 2) Provide the tools and guidelines for developing leadership skills and interpersonal strategies for diverse workforce environments; 3) Facilitate the Course Participants’ discussion and feedback through exercises, presentations, and video materials regarding the key topics important in leveraging diversity in the workplace; 5) Discuss actual, ongoing workplace examples from the Course Participants regarding organizational diversity action strategies and facilitated activities; 6) Encourage the presentation and sharing of the top one or two (or more) activities and actions that Course Participants might implement within their work place; 7) Present a “process effectiveness model” to ensure awareness and sensitivity to interactions of importance in the cultural diverse work place; 8) Summarize workshop evaluation information from each participant and provide session-by-session feedback in terms of the Participants’ evaluation and reaction to the workshop; 9) Consolidate needs assessment information from the three training sessions to be gathered to provide a mini-needs assessment for OM; and 10) Executive Summary Report (3 to 5 pages) of the “Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace” course in terms of key concepts, viable action strategies, and useful ‘next steps’ for application by the organization will be provided at the conclusion of the three training sessions. The time frame for these workshops will be over the period of two months to begin immediately after the closing date of this notice. The following FAR Clauses shall apply to this solicitation: 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; 52.212 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.214-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers. All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit capability statements and written quotations by the due date referenced above. The award is intended to be issued on a sole source basis because Herbert Z. Wong and Associates is uniquely qualified to conduct this training due to the fact that they conducted the CDER Cultural Survey and they have specific familiarity and knowledge of the organization to incorporate from these findings in performing the necessary comparisons for this diversity training. They currently hold a comprehensive repository of Rensis Likert Associates, Inc. (RLA) survey instruments, metrics, and analytical procedures. RLA, Inc. is the firm that is now defunct, but conducted the 1996 CDER survey. It would be more cost effective to use this company since they have historical data. It would be cost prohibitive to start with a new contractor due to the time and effort it would take to gather this data. All questions should be submitted in writing via e-mail to TONEILL@OC.FDA.GOV or fax to 301-827-7106. FAR provisions can be found at the following website: http://www/arnet.gov.

<DESC>Solicitation SP4410-05-R-8001 will be issued for the recovery of precious metals from GFP/GFM.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be a five year contract with an eighteen month base period, three twelve month option periods and a six month option period.  The contractor will be required to recover precious metals (gold, silver, platinum family metals) from government furnished property/government furnished material (GFP/GFM).  The contractor will be required to either pickup the GFP/GFM from Government sites throughout the United States or GFP/GFM will be shipped to the contractor’s facility for the contractor to then process into a homogeneous state.  Assays of samples by contractor will be used to determine the amount and type of precious metals contained in the lots.  Settlement will then be for an equivalent amount of refined precious metals due the government.  The processing of only part of the material for the purpose of representing the whole is not allowed.  The Government will specify in the contract the methods to be used by the contractor to process the material.  Any alternative methods must be approved by the Government.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released in early to mid June 2005.

Hard-copies of the pocket guides and summaries are too bulky for the clinicians to carry around so versions of those documents loaded on their PDAs would be instantly accessible and convenient. The intent of these PDA files are for utilization of clinical professionals on individual PDA and Pocket PC hand-held instruments, while performing routine medical health care, during assessment and evaluation phases of patient care at patient bedside, in examining and treatment rooms and in theater of operations (in the field).  The purpose of the rebranding of the software is to enable VA and DOD clinicians to read the clinical practice guideline tools with the intended navigation functionality built into the program text files.  The purpose of the upgrade licenses is to ensure that VA and DOD can upgrade their software or equipment as needed. Intent: VACO intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with DC & Co. of Irvine, CA for four (4) software license agreements. DC & Co. is the proprietary provider of this software and the only know company that can meet the needs of the VA. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.00. This procurement is under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, 11.104-4 and 11.104-5.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Jordan 400kV Transmission Line Feasibility Study.  Reference is made to the 16 March 2005 announcement, reference number 05-21005A, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data to develop a feasibility study for a 400kV dual overhead transmission line from Aqaba to Amman, a new Amman East 400/132 kV substation and to extend the existing Aqaba 400 kV substation.

This is to notify interested U.S. firms that the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO), the project sponsor or Grantee for the project, received written request for clarification of the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Jordan 400kV Transmission Line project by U.S. companies.  We are herewith providing a public response to that request, providing the same information to all potential bidders on this project.

The technical questions posed by the U.S. companies as well as NEPCO’s response are written below:

Q1.   What information is already available on the proposed transmission route (i.e. ground surveys; x,y,z coordinate map; topographical study) as part of the pre-feasibility study?

A1.   The requested information are not available and the consultant is requested to do the ground surveys, topographical study and the routes direction angles in accordance to both Task 4 of the RFP/TOR and to the suggested route and direction defined by Grantee in general.

Q2.   The RFP calls for the feasibility study to provide detailed design and cost estimates as part of the feasibility study (Task 7).  We would like to get a better sense of your expectations in terms of what will be required.  Will our recommended design need to be to a level of detail where it is ready for implementation by the EPC contractor or is there some flexibility, allowing us to determine a logical route for a typical construction, which would then be further refined as part of project implementation?

A2.   Reference to Tasks 6 & 8, the consultant is requested to prepare detailed design, cost estimates and tender's documents, to be ready for tendering purposes, for the selected configuration done in accordance to task 4 in coordination and cooperation with Grantee (NEPCO) staff. 

Q3.   Please advise whether there are existing models of the country system currently available. 

A3.   All technical data of NEPCO and the interconnected systems are modeled in PSS/E Format (Siemens PTI product ). 

Q4. We would like also to know if a multi-country model is currently available.

A4.   Same as in A3.

Q5.   Please advise whether NEPCO have a preference for the modeling software to be used for the study?  The most likely options available are a GE product called PSLF and a Siemens PTI product called PSS/E.  

A5.   Same as  in A3.

Q6. Is a draft copy of the contract between Grantee (NEPCO) and Consultant available for review?

A6.   Not available yet and it will be done in coordination with the selected consultant after the issuance of the letter of award. 

Q7. What is the level of collaboration that NEPCO is willing / expected to provide?

A7.   A local technical team from NEPCO staff will be assigned to work jointly with consultant.  Therefore, the integration of tasks and duties of our local team and the consultant’s team should be clearly defined in the proposal.  Taking into consideration that NEPCO’s PSS/E license will be used.

Q8.   In addition to load flow, stability and short circuit studies, it is generally necessary to conduct electromagnetic transient studies in order to produce the required detailed specification.  In our opinion and experience, electromagnetic transient studies cannot be accommodated within the available budget resources.  However, they are indeed necessary.  Is NEPCO going to provide these studies?

Alternatively, are we supposed to provide typical values to be confirmed later when such studies are carried out?

A8.   In accordance with tasks 4, 6 & 8 requirements, the electromagnetic field, radio interference and creepage path ( mm / kV ) and total insulator strings length are required and the consultant must conduct the necessary studies and designs. 

Q9.   We would appreciate if you could advise us about the major equipment currently installed at the existing Aqaba substation including the make/model/year of the most important equipment.

A9.   Aqaba s/s is an indoor GIS type.

Equipment	Transformer	Circuit Breaker	Isolator	Reactor

Voltage (kV)	400/132/33	-	-	-

Q10.  Please advise which of the following documents are available.

·	Energy Sector Master Plan for Jordan and/or Region.
·	Details of NEPCO cost estimates for proposed Project.

<DESC>This RFI is issued on behalf of Christian Wallace.  Please submit all general inquires, questions, clarifications, and responses to Mr. Wallace at 512-326-6646 or christian.wallace@mail.va.gov.   Current Non-SNA Controller Requirement Description: The AAC would like to replace 14 IBM 3174 non systems network architecture (non-SNA) Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS) multiple console support (MCS) console controller units, (5 are 3174 21L models and the other 9 are 3174 01L models), with a smaller number of controllers while continuing to be able to support non-SNA COAX connectivity requirements and at the same time be able to add additional MVS images without incurring additional expenses. The AAC non-SNA control units currently support 4 MVS Logical Partitions (LPARs).  Each LPAR requires two non-SNA 3174 control units (for redundancy) and each non-SNA 3174 control unit requires COAX attachment for at least 2 MVS MCS console “dumb” terminals, 1 MVS console printer, and 2 StorageTek (STK) Silo Library Management Unit (LMU) connections. Current SNA Controller Requirement Description: The AAC would also like to replace 6 3174-type SNA control units (5 are IBM 3174 11L models and 1 is a Memorex Telex 1174), with a smaller number of controllers while continuing to be able to support all SNA connectivity requirements.    The AAC SNA control units currently support 11 SNA Servers, providing the following 3270 terminal and print services: ·	7 Windows 2000 (SP1) workstations, operating Microsoft Host Integration Server (HIS) V5.00.0873 ·	1 Windows 2000 (SP4) workstation operating Attachmate e-Vantage V2.1  ·	2 Windows NT workstations operating NetSoft (DynaComm/Elite) AdaptSNA V4.42 ·	1 Unix Sun workstation operating OpenConnect SNA Gateway V4R9 The above Servers are equipped with a total of 22 16/4Mbps Token-Ring Adapters, each with an RJ45 cable connected to one of 5 Proteon P2710 Multi-Station Access Units (via RJ45-to-IBM-Data-Connector Adapter Plugs).  Each MAU is connected to one of 5 IBM 3174-11L Establishment Controllers, Configuration B Release 4. Console Controller Consolidation Requirements: To accomplish a consolidation of the non-SNA and SNA console controllers and support redundancy, the AAC would require the solution to be split across at least 2 controller devices that satisfy the requirements.  Total number of non-SNA connections that would need to be supported is 64 and the total number of SNA connections is 32. Would prefer that the controller offered would be able to support both SNA and non-SNA functionality.  Controllers must support capability of connecting 2 ESCON adaptors (for multiple CPU connectivity).  All non-SNA connections are Coax and all SNA connections are Token Ring. To accomplish the non-SNA and SNA control unit consolidation, we require a device that is: 1.	Rack mountable 2.	Capable of supporting multiple MVS images (LPARs) 3.	Capable of COAX connectivity 4.	Capable of Token Ring connectivity 5.	Can provide multiple console sessions through a single COAX connection 6.	Will attach with and utilize the speed of ESCON. Any IBM 3174-11L replacement SNA controller solution must be compatible with the Microsoft HIS, Attachmate e-Vantage and OpenConnect SNA Gateway systems described above.  The AAC may consider products that cannot support NetSoft AdaptSNA.  Preference should be given to the solution requiring the least changes on the part of the Windows/Unix Systems Administrators and Mainframe Systems Programmers. If the controller solution had dual power supplies with separate plugs (to allow connection to 2 different Power Distribution Units) and as mentioned above could also manage the SNA connectivity issues, that device would be more valuable to the AAC. Peripheral Replacements: As part of the same procurement, the AAC would like to update the terminal and printer devices.  Below is a description and quantity of each type of device to be replaced: 17 -	IBM 3270 type "A" display terminals with coax attachment.  Ideally something like the IBM 3483 INFOWINDOW II without monitor so that the AAC standard monitor can be used. 3 -	Serial dot matrix bi-directional impact printers with coax attachment.  The AAC currently uses the IBM 4224 IPDS PRINTER.  Any replacement, if not the exact same model, must be capable of printing continuous feed forms (such as tape labels) and have COAX attachment.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Center for Studying Health Systems Change, 600 Maryland Avenue, SW #550, Washington, DC 20024.  The purpose of this task order contract is to fund studies of technology adoption in the context of data sharing and health systems change.  One technology we anticipate studying in depth is electronic prescribing.  The organization will conduct site visits at some of their longitudinal study sites to evaluate technology adoption, and provide AHRQ with issue briefs and data summaries.  These studies are a subset of a larger, longitudinal study conducted over the past decade by the Center for Studying Health Systems Change  (HSC).  The study results will inform AHRQ's understanding of benefits and barriers to technology adoption, with a concentration on network effects. The estimated period of performance for this task order contract is 5 years.  HSC's unique focus is on understanding how private health care markets operate locally and nationally and how decisions in the private sector interact with public policy to affect the financing and delivery of health care.  The core of HSC's efforts to date has been the Community Tracking Study (CTS), a set of periodic site visits and surveys that allows researchers to track health system changes locally and nationally.  This longitudinal community-based research design is unique to HSC.  The baseline data that come from 10 years of experience in tracking the health system provide great value in monitoring recent market developments and judging their implications for people. A cornerstone of HSC's work has been providing policy makers with cutting edge information about the ongoing changes in the health care system nationally and in local communities gathered through four rounds of site visits from 1996 to 2003. A fifth round of site visits began in January 2005.  HSC has been tracking developments in the same 12 communities, which were randomly selected to be nationally representative of metropolitan areas with populations of more than 200,000.  In this large scale qualitative research effort, over 1000 interviews are conducted each round, in-person and on the telephone with a wide array of stakeholders in the health care system, including hospital and health plan executives, leaders of major physician groups, safety net providers, benefits consultants, employers and state and local policy makers.  In each round, in addition to identifying major changes in the health care system, HSC examines in depth emerging topics of interest to policy makers. During the ongoing round of site visits, HSC is exploring the use of IT to share clinical data among providers.  With current information on IT adoption and on the broader changes occurring in the health care system, HSC is uniquely situated to investigate the adoption and use of new technologies such as e-Prescribing in physicians' offices.  The ongoing study on clinical data exchange will be the first research to focus on this type of IT and the first to study IT adoption at the community level, and will provide important context.  The studies AHRQ commissions from HSC will draw on these baseline IT findings in 12 communities as well as HSC's CTS longitudinal physician survey data on IT adoption.  Designing studies that follow on to the core HSC site visits allows AHRQ to leverage HSC's respondent contacts in local communities and build on recent IT interviews with specific organizations where possible.   Interested parties should fax capability statements to the Contracting Officer at 301-427-1740 no later than 12:00 noon on May 17, 2005.  All responses will be considered by AHRQ.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is conducting market research for the capability to move personnel and their associated gear from an offshore location, through the surf zone, and to a target location on land using a single vehicle.  USSOCOM intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) project (https://cto.acqcenter.com/dac/bids.nsf) to evaluate candidate items.  USSOCOM is interested in evaluating vehicles from vendors that currently posses a “proof of concept” vehicle or have an amphibious vehicle in production.  Speed in excess of 20 knots in the water and 10 mph on land is desired.  The vehicle should be approximately 10 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 5 feet tall in its highest configuration.  It is necessary that the transition between marine and terrain modes not require the personnel to exit the vehicle.  Acceptable modifications to an existing vehicle would be those required to allow the craft to operate as an operational military vehicle.  Responses to this RFI are requested by 18 May 2005.  Responses must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, production capability and an estimated cost for the price of the initial vehicle to be tested and production units.

<DESC>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is currently undergoing significant upgrades to provide new and improved capabilities to the warfighter & civil user communities that include earth coverage Military-Code (M-Code), anti-jam spot beam providing signal power increases, auto navigation (autonav), higher accuracy than the current system, near real time response to misleading signals from GPS space vehicles (SVs), and additional civil signals.  To that end, the GPS Joint Program Office (JPO) is soliciting proposals for various studies, capabilities, and demonstrations to increase the Air Force's understanding and capabilities in the area of satellite control segment architectures.  The Air Force desires a satellite control architecture that is modular, adaptable, and extensible to operate up to 63 satellites.  Innovative and low risk approaches are being sought for satellite control segment software architectures that provide major mission functions and commonality in user interface to the satellite operator.  Satellite operations mission areas that should be addressed include:  1) Telemetry, Tracking & Commanding (TT&C), 2) Navigation (NAV) Mission, and 3) Mission Planning (MP).  Funding of multiple contractors is anticipated, depending on the merits of the contractor proposals and the availability of funding. CONTRACT OBJECTIVES:  See Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) attached. Prospective contractors should submit a statement of capabilities in writing no later than 11 May 2005 with documented evidence of their capability to meet all technical contractual requirements.  Contractors who previously submitted their statement of capabilities for the 18 February 2005 Control Segment Request For Information (RFI) (Ref. #GPS-CS-28) do not need to submit this statement again. The purpose of this announcement is to help the government identify interested potential offerors, or teams, capable of achieving the program objectives within acceptable risks and costs.  The capability package should provide a synopsis of relevant capabilities and past experience with the following information:  1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact, job titles, telephone numbers and email addresses, 2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other, 3) Experience in satellite control segment technologies, and 4) The facilities to work at the appropriate security level.  Interested offerors must submit Statements of Capabilities (SOC) that clearly show that they are qualified to perform this effort.  Responses should also indicate the source's intent to be either a prime contractor or subcontractor.  All responses are to be unclassified and should not exceed five (5) one-sided pages. Respondents interested in being a subcontractor should not exceed two (2) one-sided pages and should briefly identify relevant experience and expertise.  Small Business Offerors are encouraged as one award may be set aside for small business depending on small business response and capabilities; note that small business size standard NAICS 541710 (1,000 employees) applies. Responses must be submitted by email in electronic form in MS Word or PDF format to victor.deal@losangeles.af.mil with a follow-up signature hard copy of the submission to SMC/GPK, Attn: Carol Laechelt, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1866, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659. All responses must conform to 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  If respondents wish to include proprietary data, they must adhere to DFAR 227.7103-10 Contractor Identification and Marking of Technical Data to be Furnished with Restrictive Markings. This synopsis is for planning purposes only; any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. Additional questions to the Government may be included under separate cover; the government reserves the right to not respond to all questions but will make an effort to respond to questions.  All questions will be considered in future program planning efforts. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this Notice of Contract, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request.

<ARCHDATE>09032005
<CONTACT>Greg Florey, 301.619.8427
<DESC>This announcement seeks to identify sources for an upcoming solicitation to be released in June or July of 2005.  The Department of Defense (DoD), through the Chemical Biological and Medical Systems (CBMS), Medical Identification and Treatment System  Joint Product Management Office (MITS JPMO) is seeking a contractor to develop a prophylactic product to be used in humans against organophosphorus nerve agents.  Currently, MITS JPMO is developing, in cooperation with the Department of Health and Human S ervices, plasma-derived human butyrylcholinesterase as the first increment of a nerve agent prophylaxis development program.  Because of the limited supply of human plasma, the MITS JPMO seeks to develop an alternative product.  The product should be capab le of strongly binding or degrading organophosphorus nerve agents before they can exhibit their toxic effects.  Potential candidates might include recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase, other recombinant proteins, or other compoun ds that have the property of binding or degrading nerve agents and/or preventing inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. The contractor will be responsible for conducting development activities and selecting and managing subcontractors that are capable of conducting various activities associated with drug/biologic development in manners that are consistent with eventual appr oval or licensure with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Initial activities will include process development and related tasks, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)-compliant small-scale manufacturing and testing of the candidate product , Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-compliant toxicology testing in animals, filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in accordance with FDA regulations and guidelines.  There will be an option for cont inuing advanced development through FDA approval (or licensure) of the product following the successful completion of the Phase 1 clinical trial and Government reviews.  MITS anticipates that the contractor will file the New Drug Application and hold the l icense for the product.  The process development efforts will be directed at development of a scalable process that yields a reproducible product amenable to safe use in humans (i.e., manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices) and in s ufficient quantities for completion of efforts through the Phase 1 clinical trial. 	The DoD acquisition process for this effort requires expeditious performance so that the Phase 1 clinical trial is completed within 3 years of contract award, which is anticipated in December 2005.  Therefore, consideration will be given only to candidate s for which there are preliminary safety and efficacy data in vivo (note that these preliminary studies do not need to be GLP compliant).  Please respond by providing a short statement that describes your product and its characteristics.  This short statem ent can include a two-page letter or white paper, links to a relevant Web site, a brochure, or similar documentation.  Please forward this information to the attention of Greg Florey, Contract Specialist, greg.florey@det.amedd.army.mil, Phone: (301) 619.84 27

<SUBJECT>D -- Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2006 (CWID2006)
<DESC>1. This Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) announcement is for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2006 (CWID 2006), scheduled for 30 May through 23 June 2006.  Combatant Commands, Services and Department of Defense (DoD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DoD, and international participants must submit interoperability trial proposals for CWID 2006 by 30 September 2005.  Industry partners must work through a C/S/A or government agency sponsor from outside the DoD to submit trials. Complete details on CWID 2006, to include the format and submission instructions for interoperability trials (ITs), can be found at http://www.cwid.js.mil. 

2. CWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event that enables the C/S/As and the international community to investigate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability.  US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), is responsible for the oversight of the CWID event.  The intent of CWID is to conduct ITs that include C4ISR technologies that are capable of being responsibly placed into an operational environment within 6-12 months following the execution phase. ITs are not limited to hardware and/or software solution assessments. The tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with using technologies are just as important as the IT solutions themselves.  Further investigation into these areas using CWID as a vehicle is highly encouraged. The USJFCOM Staff will review and consider the results of the CWID event in an effort to identify those solutions that could be responsibly fielded or endorsed to the Joint Staff J6 for referral to an existing program of record.

3. United States European Command (USEUCOM) is the host Combatant Command (COCOM) for CWID 2006.  Consequently, the scenario for CWID 2006 will reflect a more traditional military-to-military and military-to-civil authority focus on exercising its Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) responsibilities in an international setting.  United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) intends to continue its CWID transformational efforts by investigating systems integration and interoperability solutions in the Home Land Security/Home Land Defense (HLS/HLD) arena. 

USEUCOM intends to use CWID as a risk reduction venue and proving ground for emerging C4ISR technologies relevant to the GWOT.  Coalition participation and the demonstration of interoperable C4ISR systems remains the cornerstone of CWID.  Anticipated international participants will include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO to include several constituent nations.  In coordination with, and the approval of, the Joint Staff J-6, each COCOM may sponsor and invite individual nations from within their respective area of- responsibility to participate as multinational task force (MTF) members. 

4. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide a context for validation of C4ISR solutions.  Depending on the capabilities to be demonstrated during CWID Execution, each IT may receive one or more of the following assessments: Warfighter/Operator, Technical/ Interoperability, Security Capabilities assessment, and a Fielding/Sustainability Assessment.  The Systems Engineering and Integration Working Group (SEIWG), with input from other working groups, will report on those trials, which are not formally assessed by the Assessment Working Group (AWG).  Results from all trials will be detailed in the CWID Final Report.  ITs with coalition partners are conducted over a worldwide secure network, Combined Federated Battle Laboratories Network (CFBLNet) enabling trials classified SECRET releasable to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and NATO.  The use of other information domains to support diverse communities of interest and their information flow requirements is influenced by the participating nations and government agencies and approved by the CWID Senior Management Group.  

5. To be considered for participation in CWID 2006, each proposed IT must:  address one or more of the CWID 2006 objectives listed in paragraph 7, commit to fully resource the trial (funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, documentation, etc.) for one or more execution locations, be submitted in concert with a DoD sponsor or with a government sponsor from outside the DoD in the format outlined on the CWID web site. 

6.  The CWID Senior Management Group (SMG), in concert with coalition partners, will select specific IT proposals for execution by 7 November 2005 based on projected availability of resources, how well the IT satisfies one or more of the CWID objectives, and additional considerations as specified on the CWID web site.  USEUCOM will provide an initial determination on those ITs related to the GWOT. 

7. USJFCOM, in coordination with the Joint Staff, DISA, NSA, JITC, the Services and USEUCOM, gathered and prioritized objectives for CWID 2006 from the COCOM capability gaps highlighted in their collective integrated priority lists.  A summary of the five specific CWID 2006 objectives follows:

CWID 2006 Overarching Objectives and Explanations

Overview:      

The event objectives, form the foundation for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID), and are driven by the overarching need to share and exchange information between military organizations, international coalitions and civilian agencies.  The traditional view of coalitions focused on military-to-military interaction; however, it now incorporates a variety of international organizations that include military and civilian agencies.  The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) has highlighted the continuing need for unimpeded information sharing between legacy and new technologies as well as tactical exchanges between emerging coalition partners, civilian agencies and civil authorities/first responders.  By streamlining command and control capabilities, we improve our senior leadership’s ability to respond to GWOT contingencies.  The multi-national and interagency requirements for information sharing are, in many cases, more complex than those of traditional military-to-military coalition partners because of a lack of common standards and protocols for both hardware and software.  

Coalition operations, in response to international crises, continue to highlight the requirement to seamlessly exchange command, control, computer, communication, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) and logistical information.  The acceptance and endorsement of the Network Centric Warfare concept by the U.S. and the nations within the various coalitions participating in current operations, points to the need to resolve the associated technical, procedural and policy challenges. 

The CWID event provides a unique opportunity for U.S. Combatant Commanders, Homeland Security/Homeland Defense (HLS/HLD) organizations and traditional international coalitions to explore innovative information sharing and interoperability solutions.  CWID 2006 continues this successful tradition by providing a venue aimed at thoroughly integrating solutions while focusing on network centricity, and investigating tactics, techniques and procedures. 
The CWID hardware and software demonstrations support the overall Network Centric Warfare construct and leverage the advantages of emerging technology.  During the CWID execution phase, Interoperability Trial (IT) activities will be conducted over, or connected to, a world wide area network that supports military and coalition operations while providing the infrastructure to facilitate the military’s role in providing Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA).  CWID ITs are executed within the context of an overarching scenario to demonstrate how coalition warfighting and civil interagency operations can benefit from emerging technologies.
The CWID 2006 Objectives described below contain several key differences from those associated with past Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations.  First, the number of objectives has been reduced to narrow the focus of the annual event and to reflect a recurring theme of “Coalition Information Sharing.”  Second, each objective is supported by “sub-objectives” that reference clearly defined U.S. Combatant Commander and Coalition capability gaps.  Finally, each “sub-objective” is related to the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) to highlight a stronger relationship with warfighter requirements through a more defined mission-to-task linkage (specific UJTL references available upon request).  These process improvements facilitate post-CWID execution efforts to develop strategies aimed at responsibly bringing solutions to the warfighters.

Objective 1: Coalition Command & Control (C2).  Enhance the Commander’s Coalition C2 capability through secure, scalable and bandwidth sensitive technologies, within and between communities of interest (COIs) and information domains of differing security classifications.  

-	create a cohesive C2 relationship with and between military, coalition 
      and non-military activities        
-    improve open and secure mobile C2 capabilities between COIs 
-    streamline operational decision-making for GWOT contingencies 
Explanation: Coalition operations require an information environment that spans multiple COIs.  These COIs may be mobile, fixed or remotely located where the combination of military and/or civil agencies is likely to be affected by limited bandwidth.  Within any COI, mission success relates to the commander’s C2 ability to communicate directly with individual users who may be detached from fixed information domains.  Decision makers and/or first responders require interoperable, reliable and/or secure wireless capabilities to receive and transmit critical voice, data, and video information to support the Network Centric warfare construct.  Solutions to achieve improved C2 between diverse COIs should consider the use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.  

Objective 2: Coalition Information Sharing.  Provide solutions that improve the Commander’s ability to share information within a multi-lingual coalition that is secure, scalable and bandwidth sensitive.   Included in this objective are improvements to language translation tools that provide grammatically correct, militarily appropriate context, multi-language translations to support verbal and textual collaboration within and between disparate information domains.  

-     multi-level and multi-domain security 
-	improve utility, accuracy and language capacity of translation tools 
      (French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and Russian) 
o	written-to-voice, visa versa
o	voice-to-voice 
o	user friendly displays 
Explanation: Coalition information sharing is more than providing a common operational picture at the strategic or major echelon level of command.  It must be secure, scaleable in scope and functional within the theater bandwidth available at all levels of warfare.  Trial proposals should be capable of using existing interface standards and protocols that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data.  Solutions must support each nation’s disclosure and release policies as well as provide a secure means of consistently communicating accurate information in a multi-lingual military and/or local authority context.  Possible information to exchange includes: directive commentary, friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, Global Information Services (GIS) map data, equipment status, personnel movements and other intelligence related products.   A key subset to creating and sustaining a coalition information-sharing environment is that users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains.  Further, coalition operations are routinely conducted with multiple nations and organizations that are challenged with using a common language.  A tool to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges between planners and end-users, is a requirement of operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels.  Current translation tools include inadequate vocabularies for limited languages and typically do not provide grammatically correct or militarily relevant translations.  Additionally, no translation tool currently provides for the simultaneous translation of a single language to multiple languages. Inherent in this requirement is the need to fuse dissimilar information and extract specific data sets while providing reliable language translations for communicating guidance to coalition partners. 

Objective 3:  Integrated Logistics.  Provide solutions for responsive, effective logistics within and between multiple information communities of interest (COIs).
- 	develop the ability to assess and display information on the movement, location and status of US and coalition partners’ equipment and personnel en route and/or deployed 
-	improve logistics data access, fusion and integration among COIs 

Explanation:  Within the information environment of a coalition, military and non-military operations, the commander must have responsive and effective logistics.  Logistic data is contained within diverse logistics information systems maintained by the military and civilian agencies across the coalition.  Access to that data implies combining total asset visibility and information during the transit of friendly forces into a single information presentation available across multiple information COIs.  Solutions should address the locating and fusion of logistics information feeds as part of the commander’s general situation awareness.  Solutions to achieve CWID objectives should consider the use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations or propose new approaches that are relatively mature in gaining security certification for operational use.

Objective 4: Continuity of Operations.  Provide C2 solutions that enhance the Commander’s ability to plan, communicate and affect coalition operations while remotely deployed.   Inherent in this objective is the ability of the commander to maintain situational awareness and connectivity with subordinate activities while en route to the theater in crisis. 

-	enhance Commander’s ability to rapidly deploy a joint force     
      headquarters 

Explanation: Commanders are challenged to sustain their situational awareness once they depart on their assigned mission.  Trial proposals must be capable of using existing interface standards and protocols that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data.  Possible information requirements include: friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, Global Information Services (GIS) map data, equipment status, personnel movements and other intelligence-related information.  When appropriate, the solution must be scaleable to provide GIS and Global Command and Control System (GCCS) situational awareness information to non-military, federal, state and local participants via a protected, multi-lingual and secure network, common to all.  Information exchange should support pre-event and en route planning as well as the situational awareness during the execution of operations.  At a higher level, this objective involves effective information dissemination and knowledge management.  This includes problems of integration, or conversion of data from one format to another, identification of producers/ consumers of information, and how to transmit the information securely from end-to-end while supporting national disclosure/release policy.  A key subset to creating and sustaining effective situational awareness is users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains, while operating within a bandwidth-constrained architecture.  Additionally, the integrity and continuity of sharing common information across networks must be preserved.  Potential trials need to explore web technology, improved data labeling, data standardization and / or enhancements to existing solutions while being realistically acceptable to security management concerns.  Where applicable to information sharing, data encryption must be accomplished at the lowest level.

Objective5: Net Centric Enterprise Services.  Provide solutions that enhance the Commander’s ability to collaborate and disseminate information among communities of interest (COIs) in a Net Centric environment.  

-	improve information assurance
-	improve horizontal data access, fusion and integration 
-	improve vertical and horizontal information distribution

Explanation:  Network Centric Enterprise Services imply that coalition, military and non-military civilian authorities can harness the power of their respective information environments to collaboratively plan and execute operations even in a bandwidth-constrained environment.  Collaborative planning and dissemination of products in a bandwidth constrained environment horizontally across and vertically within COIs is an emerging issue for the warfighter, particularly as software and procedure tools become sufficiently robust to be extended from the operational to the tactical level of warfare.  Operations require an information environment that is not only scaleable, but one that spans multiple COIs.  These COIs may be populated and maintained by military or civil agencies or a combination of both and it is likely they will be bandwidth-constrained. The information exchange between these COIs must be accomplished in such a way that it inspires confidence at each activity that the information is being disseminated securely, and will only be available to the agreed upon and authorized participants.  Solutions to achieve this data dissemination, across and within COIs, should consider the use of existing, approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.

Statement of Work Disk Superalloy (ME3) Specimen Machine and Test Procurement Period of Performance June 2005 – December 2006 A)	CREEP machine, then test:  Please quote on 8 creep specimens to be EDM blanked from a disk section, machined to a mutually agreed specimen configuration having a gage diameter of 0.25” and maximum length of 3.50” with shot peened threads, then creep tested according to ASTM E 139, the test setup instructions below, 500 hour test time assumed at 1300F for quoting.  Creep test procedures/steps, in accordance with ASTM E 139:   1.	Shot peen the threads. 2.	Measure gage diameter, gage length between radius corners, and overall length using pre-agreed procedures. 3.	Perform alignment check and cert on each creep frame to be used.  Mount in the creep load frame using your standard grips. 4.	After mounting and fully aligning specimen and extensometer in the load frame and furnace, preload the specimen to 50% of the test load. 5.	Complete any packing of the furnace with insulation. 6.	Gently download to between 15 and 10% of the test load for heat up. 7.	If at any time after step 3 the load goes below 10% of the applied load, must go back to step 3 and 50% preload at room temperature. 8.	Equilibrate minimum of 1 hour at test temperature, until the strain is constant over a 15 minute interval.  This should not require more than 3 hours.	 9.	At the start of the test, use consistent load-up rate and record data at 1 min. intervals, then lengthen intervals as appropriate. 10.	Stop test when it reaches 500 hours, cool under load. B)	TENSILE machine, then test:  Please quote on 11 tensile specimens to be EDM blanked from a disk section, machined to specimen configuration 4013195-001P01, which uses 1/4-20 grip threads.  Please include shot peening of the grip threads on all machined specimens.  Then tensile test per ASTM E 21 at elevated temperatures to be specified 1000F to 1400F.   Tensile test procedures, in accordance with ASTM E 21:	 1.  Measure gage diameter at mid-gage, gage length between radius corners, and overall length using pre-agreed procedures. 2.  Note no gage marks or divot marks should be applied to this notch-sensitive material.  3.  Keep on the extensometer until about 2% strain while testing at 0.5% per minute. 4.  Remove extensometer before going to stroke control to specimen failure at a faster crosshead motion of 0.05 times the adjusted length of the gage section per minute (5% per minute approximated strain rate). C)	FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH machine: Please quote on 5 FCG specimens to be EDM blanked from a disk section, inertia welded with contractor supplied IN718 grip ends, then machined to specimen configuration NASA Kb bar fatigue crack growth specimens.	Please ship all Kb specimens as soon as available.   D)	NOTCHED LOW CYCLE FATIGUE machine and test: Please quote on 19 NLCF specimens to be EDM blanked from a disk section, inertia welded with contractor supplied IN718 grip ends, then machined to specimen configuration NASA NLCF.   NASA NLCF specimen tests  These will all have a 90 second dwell at maximum load in each cycle, assume 100 h total test time:   1.	Shot peen the shanks with the gage protected from damage. 2.	Use an optical comparator to measure notch radius and notch diameter, 5 readings each, then clean with ethanol and cloth.  3.	Use at least two thermocouples in the gage section: control from one, comparing their temperatures after heat up and equilibration. 4.	First run 10+ cycles at about 10% of the load range (R=0) to check the test system’s control stability. 5.	Start test using an agreed startup procedure which gradually increases the load range to the target value while avoiding overloads.   6.	90 second dwell tests: run to failure or directed interruption, assume 100h total time duration for each test in the quote.  Place fracture specimen halves in the plastic tube with the button ends butting together, fracture surfaces protected from metal contact. E)  LOW CYCLE FATIGUE machine and test: Please quote on 18 specimens to be blanked, machined, and then LCF tested as described below. MACHINING:  The vendor will have to first machine specimen blanks from ME3-type nickel-base superalloy disk material supplied by NASA, by electro-discharge machining as per NASA drawings.  The vendor shall then machine specimens using the specimen drawings listed below.  The shanks of all LCF specimens shall be shotpeened, while the gage sections are masked for protection from shotpeening.  The vendor shall need to supply and inertia weld IN718 superalloy grip ends onto disk material blanks for subsequent machining of the make-up specimens.  The final specimens shall be PGR-3-1997.  The drawing list: Drawing No.		Description 1)  EDM Blank		Electro-discharge machining of blank from disk forging, cost per square inch 2)  4013195-731P03short Make-up inertia welded specimens (vendor to furnish IN718 grip ends) 3)  PGR-3-1997		0.40” gage dia. LCF specimen with button-head ends from –731P03short These standard drawings should currently be on file at the vendor’s location.  All test material scrap shall be returned to NASA, identified according to forging blanking layout and identification number.  The machined specimens shall be inspected after machining for meeting drawing specifications, and any discrepancy shall be communicated immediately for resolution.  Each specimen shall be separately packaged according to specimen identification number.	The specimens after testing shall then be shipped to NASA Glenn Research Center, 21000 Brookpark Rd., Cleveland, OH 44135 (attn. Tim Gabb M.S. 49-3). Low Cycle Fatigue Tests - The vendor shall run strain-controlled or load-controlled fatigue tests according to the latest ASTM E-606 standards.  Stress-strain hysteresis loops at periodic cycles as well as tabulated results including initial and half life values of modulus, maximum and minimum stresses, and inelastic strain range shall be reported as appropriate; as well as expansion strain, initiation life, and failure life.  The tables shall be provided as hard copies and on a computer disk as Excel spread sheets.  Tested specimens and remnant material from machining shall be returned.  Then for elevated temperatures up to 1300F please quote quantity discounted unit price for E-606 strain-controlled fatigue tests and load-controlled fatigue tests of these specimens.  The test quotes should be provided for tests assumed to each run a total time duration of 24 hours, using the procedures described below: 1.	Shot peen the shanks with the gage protected from damage. 2.	Measure gage diameter, clean with ethanol and cloth.  3.	Use at least two thermocouples in the gage section: control from one, comparing their temperatures  after heat up and equilibration. 4.	First run 10+ cycles in load control, then 10+ cycles in strain control, both at about 0.2% strain range (R=0) to check extensometer stability and the test system’s control stability. 5.	Start test using an agreed startup procedure which gradually increases the strain range to the target value at 0.05 hertz while avoiding overstrains.  Then continue the test at a frequency of 0.33 hertz for 6 hours.	Then: a.	If max. and min. cyclic stresses are stabilized, please switch to load control at 10 hertz with the same max. and min. cyclic stresses, run to 5x106 cycles runout. b.	If cyclic stresses are still relaxing by more than 1 ksi per 500 cycles, continue until stabilized for mode switch for up to 2 more hours.  Call if not yet stabilized. 6.	Run test to failure, agreed tensile load drop, or agreed runout cycles.  Place fracture specimen halves in the plastic tube with the button ends butting together, fracture surfaces protected from metal contact. Please quote assuming material for at least 10 specimens would be supplied at a time.  A delivery time of 8 weeks after receipt of material is desired.	Deliveries of partial quantities are encouraged and will be acceptable for meeting delivery time requirements in large orders.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
MSHA will evaluate the performance, capabilities and capacities of the offers.  Offerors should address all items listed above.  Factors that will be evaluated and that must be described in detail in the offeror’s response to this solicitation are:

If tiered pricing is proposed, the offeror shall clearly indicate each pricing point and the price for that tier.  If tiered pricing is proposed, the evaluated price shall be based upon the MSHA’s estimate of usage. 
The offeror shall submit one original hard copy of the proposal as well as two electronic copies in Microsoft Word.  Electronic copies may be on 3 ¼” floppy disks or CD.  Cost proposals may be in either MS Word or MS Excel.

While MSHA intends to make an award from this solicitation, it reserves the right to make no award based on the quality of proposals submitted.  MSHA is not responsible for and will not reimburse any bid and proposal costs incurred by offerors.
Each offeror must submit a proposal in accordance with the instructions herein.  Proposals must respond to and meet all of the mandatory requirements of this solicitation.  Failure to meet any mandatory requirement may be cause for rejection of an offer without further consideration.  When evaluating an offeror, the Government will consider how well the offeror complied with both the letter and intent of these instructions.

Responses may be made electronically to beaty.robert@dol.gov.  Any questions relating to this solicitation should be forwarded to the above address no later than 3:00 pm EDT Tuesday, May 10, 2005.

FAR 52.212-2 – EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999). 

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 
Order of Importance:  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following factors: Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  Technical (Factor 1), Past Performance (Factor 2), and Price (Factor 3) are of equal importance.
	
Evaluation Procedures:  The Government intends to award one contract to the responsive, responsible offer using the lowest priced, technically acceptable source selection process.  Technical Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability or unacceptability only.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.   Once a proposal has been determined acceptable under Factor 1 and Factor 2, the proposal will then be evaluated for the lowest price.

Factor 1 – Technical Capability:  Technical capability will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.  An offeror must comply with all aspects of the technical requirements as established in the Statement of Work and must meet criteria set forth in the Evaluation Criteria.  Also included are general considerations such as contract terms and conditions.

Factor 2 – Past Performance:  Past Performance acceptability will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a “Neutral/Unknown Confidence” rating for past performance. In investigating relevant past performance, the Government will consider information in the offerors proposal and information obtained from other sources.  Other sources may include past and present customers and their employees, other Government agencies including state and local agencies, pre-award surveys, consumer protection agencies and better business bureaus, and others who may have useful information.  Factors such as customer satisfaction, timeliness, product quality, and similarity to the existing project will be taken into account.  To be acceptable, the proposal must provide sufficient information about the offerors performance record that the Government can determine that the offeror should be able to successfully perform the required effort.

Factor 3 - Price:  Technically acceptable proposals found to have an acceptable record of technical capabilities and past performance will be evaluated for the lowest price.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.

 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision)
Discussions: Discussions or negotiations may be conducted with all offerors within the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.610.  If an offeror is given an opportunity to correct any deficiencies in a proposal and after correction the proposal is still determined to be unacceptable, such determinations will be cause for rejection of the proposal.  No offeror will be given an unlimited amount of opportunities for correction of a proposal. The Government reserves the right to make a final determination whether a proposal is acceptable or unacceptable solely on the basis of the information submitted and to proceed without requesting additional information.

<DESC>The following are question and answers that were submitted by the deadline of Fri, 29 Apr 05:

Q1:	Are the hallway lights in the dorms always left on?
A1: 	Yes, dorm hallway lights are left on 24hrs a day.  The dayroom area lights are sometimes off.

Q2: 	Is there a conduit pathway between dorm and monitoring area? 
A2:	All indications are that there is not an existing conduit available but there is sufficient space to provide one per the wall sections.

Q3:	Is there a requirement for cable to the monitoring area be in conduits or may they be fish through the ceiling?
A3:	There doesn’t seem to be a requirement to place A/V or CAT 3/5 in conduit, it may be fished through the ceiling and bundled with zip-ties.

Q4:	Are the parking lot cameras to focus on the actual parking area or are they more for a view of the entrance into the building?
A4:	The parking lot cameras are to monitor what vehicles enter the parking lot, focus should not be placed on the entrance to the facility.  The cameras should only be for vehicle identification, not facial recognition for the parking lot cameras.

Q5:	Is the HVAC system sufficient for placement of additional monitoring equipment/DVRs/UPS system in a working office (Room 114)?
A5:	Yes.  Rooms 114 and 115 have a dedicated system that will provide sufficient cooling for the new equipment.

Q6:	Do cameras and wiring need to be tamper proof?
A6:  	No.

Q7:	Is exposed wiring acceptable?  What type of conduit is required to meet base code?
A7:	See Q3.  No loosely strung cable will be authorized and should remain out of plain sight to the highest extent possible, where it is inevitable neutral colored plastic or metal raceway will suffice.  Please indicate where these occurrences might happen.

Q8:	What are the fire and safety code requirements?  Does the contractor need to follow special electrical codes?
A8:	Typical construction contract regulations, laws, and USAF Instructions shall be adhered to as amended.  Electronic equipment shall be Underwriters Laboratory (UL) listed.  NEC, NFPA, etc. should be followed. 

Q9:	What are minimum requirements of the UPS system?
A9:	One UPS for each DVR, sufficient power to provide for electrical interruptions and spikes without damaging equipment.

Q10:	Will wireless cameras systems be accepted?
A10:	Wireless cameras will not be accepted.

Q11:	What is your minimum amount of acceptable DVR storage capacity?  30 days?
A11:    30 days minimum.

Q12:	What will the period of performance be?  If the contract is not awarded until mid-May, will the contractor be responsible to meet the June 5 deadline?  Timeframe seems unrealistic for design, delivery, installation, configuration, testing, and training of a quality system.
A12:	The revised date will be 20 June 2005. 

Q13:	What type of warranty are you looking for and what is the minimum acceptable down time?
A13:  Standard warranty for like items.  What is typically acceptable for this industry?  I believe one year on parts and equipment upon delivery and one year labor after completion should suffice.

Q14:	What are your cable run requirements?  Do cables need to be enclosed in conduit?
A14:	See Q3 and Q7
