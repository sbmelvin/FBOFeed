<DESC>The U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command (ACC), Joint Munitions & Lethality(JM&L) Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf Benet Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, NY 12189-4000, is contemplating award of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).  Interested sources should be capable of providing a wide variety of video inspection equipment and documentation for developmental components, fixtures, and hardware in support of the Rifled Dial Bore Gage Project.  This includes but is not limited to the following: video inspection devices, video measuring systems, precision measuring devices, recording capabilities, replacement parts, and all supporting equipment. 

The object of the Rifled Dial Bore Gage Project is to find a gage to replace the antiquated pull-over gage which is currently fielded.  Reproducibility and repeatability studies showed a large error margin with this pullover gage.  In order to eliminate erroneous data reporting which could result in premature tube condemnation, a new dial bore gage has been developed.  This gage is easy to read and goes to the exact location in the bore where the diameter is to be measured in accordance with the Technical Manual.   Studies show that this gage eliminates data collection errors by allowing the soldier to collect a more precise and accurate measurement. 
  The Government may enter into one or multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) as a result of this notice.  This notice is set-aside to small business concerns.

TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.
The Government will accept written questions by email only. Submittals and questions should be directed to the following point of contact: US Army Contracting Command, Attn. Christina Nigro, CCJM-JA, Bldg. 10, Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000, or via email at christina.nigro@us.army.mil. 
Note, this notice does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP)/Request for Quote (RFQ), nor will the Government be issuing a formal RFP/RFQ as this is a Blanket Purchase Agreement.  In addition, the Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice.  The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice.

The improved residential comfort is achieved by clearly organizing rooms in a hierarchical manner, with residential rooms flanking perimeter walls, and shared activity areas in core spaces, with access to natural light.  
The estimated construction cost is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.  Consideration is limited to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses, and the solicitation will be issued as a Sealed Bid.  The bids shall be hand delivered to the Main Auditorium on the first floor at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center.  Bids may also be mailed to Cassaundra Mulligan, Code S150B, Ralph H. Johnson VAMC, 109 Bee Street, Charleston, SC  29401-5799.  All Bids must be received before 2:30 PM Eastern time the day of the bid opening or anytime before the day of the bid opening.  If bids are not received by 2:30 PM Eastern time the day of the bid opening, they will be considered late.  
The NAICS Code for this requirement is 236220 and the Small Business Size Standard is $33.5M.  This notice is issued subject to the availability of funds and is not a request for proposal.  The solicitation will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities Website on or about June 1, 2010 with proposals due on or about July 1, 2010.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to acquire an Isotope ratio mass spectrometer and the associatedfront end peripheral devices, gas chromatograph (GC) and elemental analyzer (EA) fromThermo Fisher Scientific.  Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) is the gold standardfor stable isotopic measurements and is the only way to ground truth flightinstrumentation designed to make isotopic measurements. This instrument will enablemeasurement of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and noble gas stable isotopes and willsupport current research such as chamber experiments to simulate planetarysurface-atmosphere interactions and subsurface hydrothermal environments.  This willenable new research directions in astrobiology and planetary geochemistry while providingdirect support to mission science and instrument development.  Thermo Fisher Scientifics mass spectrometer and automated sample preparation and inletsystem have a large number of unique hardware and software features, which lead to uniquecapabilities and superior specifications for the analyses of interest to NASA.	Theirunique capabilities are evident in the realization of a highly specialized hybridGC-MS/IRMS fabricated for NASA/GSFC, in which a quadrupole mass spectrometer was fullyintegrated with the IRMS.  The realization of this configuration required specialplumbing, special software, special testing, and special installation procedures, whichfully met NASAs need for an integrated GC-MS/IRMS hybrid instrument.

<DESC>TITLE - ARRAOS: Increasing Adoption of Early Intervention to Prevent Diabetes after Gestational DM.
<p>RECOVERY ACT - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER GSA's MOBIS CONTRACT (Schedule 874), UTILIZING PROCEDURES PRESCRIBED IN FAR PART 8.4.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the ARRA reporting requirements prescribed in FAR Part 52.204-11, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Reporting Requirements. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulations www.arnet.gov/far.</p>
<p>The intended procurement will be classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. The small business size standard is $7M. This notification is not a request for quotations.</p>
<p>Diabetes Mellitus is a priority condition identified in Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). Currently 23.6 million children and adults in the United States have diabetes. An estimated 57 million or more people in the United States are a high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and its follow-up study, the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), demonstrated that the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes can be reduced in people identified at high risk, including a substantial cohort with gestational diabetes. Effective strategies to disseminate the DPP/DPPOS findings and decrease risk and prevent or delay the development of the disease across populations and in communities are needed. Women with a history of gestational diabetes provide a unique opportunity for identification of, and early intervention in, a high risk population.</p>
<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes that is first diagnosed during pregnancy. About 7 percent of all US pregnancies - about 200,000 each year - are complicated by gestational diabetes. Women who have been diagnosed with GDM are at a markedly increased risk of having it again during future pregnancies or developing type 2 diabetes later in life.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is a study focusing on one of the populations at highest risk for developing Type 2 diabetes, that will identify effective ways to bring this proven intervention into clinical practice and engage women with a history of GDM and their health care providers in lifestyle behavior changes and/or medical therapy to prevent or delay Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>This solicitation will be a competitive acquisition based on a fixed price contract type. This opportunity is available only to contractors who are listed on the GSA MOBIS schedule. Please note that to be eligible for award of this project, prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system, and have completed and maintained current Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) prior to the closing date of the solicitation.</p>

<CONTACT>Adelis M. Rodriguez, Phone 301-492-3623, Fax 301-492-3437, Email adelis.rodriguez@nrc.gov
<DESC><p>The NRC is responsible for ensuring adequate safety and security for radioactive materials, including transactions involving radioactive materials, and the materials licensing process. This project directly supports these goals by providing a secure and effective set of automated tools to house and maintain information on licensees, nationally tracked sources possessed by licensees, and licensee transactions. The NRC seeks contractor support for the planning, acquisition, system certification, development, deployment, hosting, and maintenance of NRC's Integrated Source Management Portfolio (ISMP) project. The portfolio consists of three systems, two that are in the planning stages the License Verification System (LVS) and the Web Based Licensing (WBL) System; and one system already in operation the National Source Tracking System (NSTS).
<p>Within the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Office of Federal and State Materials and Environmental Management Programs (FSME) develops, implements and oversees the regulatory framework for industrial, commercial, and medical uses of radioactive materials, uranium recovery activities, and the decommissioning of previously operating nuclear facilities and power plants. In addition, FSME conducts extensive environmental assessments in Support of these regulatory functions. Our regulatory work is done in a manner that protects public health and safety, provides for the common defense and security, and protects the environment. We implement these regulatory programs in coordination with our partners at other Federal agencies, the States, the NRC Regions, and Tribal governments.</p>
<p>The events of September 11, 2001 heightened the nation's concern regarding the use of radioactive materials for a malevolent act. The potential for such an attack has been of particular concern because of the widespread use of radioactive materials (often contained in sealed sources) in the United States and abroad by industry, hospitals, and academic institutions. A major impetus for this project is the need to control nuclear materials that could be used in a radiological dispersal device (RDD) or "dirty bomb" - a conventional explosive that carries nuclear materials and releases them on detonation. The NRC has been proactively working on material "real time" tracking capability since 2005.</p>
<p>In late 2006 and early 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a test on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's controls governing the issuance of licenses for possessing certain types of radioactive materials and for enforcing possession limits on the quantities of those materials. Subsequently, GAO reported that they were able to obtain radioactive materials licenses for two fabricated companies, modify the licenses to raise the possession limits, and utilize the augmented licenses to receive quotes for purchasing radioactive materials from legitimate licensees.</p>
<p>At a July 12, 2007 Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) hearing following GAO's report, it was suggested that the NRC should consider establishing a web-based licensing (verification) system that would allow suppliers to validate purchaser licenses and the authorized quantity that a purchaser could obtain. Former NRC Commissioner, Edward McGaffigan Jr., stated that information technology (IT) is one area in which NRC should improve to prevent fraudulent radioactive material license claims and alteration of possession limits. GAO, NRC, and Congress deemed this as a necessary and urgent IT initiative to protect the nation from the threat of malevolent use of nuclear materials.</p>
<p>In an effort to better track radioactive materials, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission developed a comprehensive Action Plan outlining a number of specific steps to address the concerns raised by the GAO report and in the Senate Committee hearing. This plan consists of a portfolio of automated tools for credential tracking (license and certificate), inspection tracking, item tracking (devices and sources), event tracking, license verification, and financial interfacing. Initial development efforts that are included in the portfolio were - (1) the National Source Tracking System (NSTS), (2) the Web-Based Licensing (WBL), system and (3) the License Verification System (LVS). NSTS is currently in the final stages of development. A description of each system is provided below.</p>
<p>National Source Tracking System (NSTS)</p>
<p>The National Source Tracking System (NSTS), which has been under development since 2003, is a tracking system for the transfer of responsibility of sealed sources of radioactive materials. This tracking spans the life cycle of the source from manufacture through shipment receipt, decay, and burial. It supports controlled authorizations and accountability for licensed suppliers and licensed recipients of sealed sources. The successful implementation of NSTS will satisfy NRC's commitment to Congress to develop source tracking regulations as envisioned in the International Atomic Energy Agency's Code of Conduct in 2004. NSTS was given authority to operate (ATO) in December 2008. NSTS is a Level 4 system has a "High" security categorization.</p>
<p>Web-Based Licensing System (WBL)</p>
<p>The Web-Based Licensing System (WBL) is envisioned as a NRC material licensing system for managing licensing information for businesses using radioactive materials. The NRC web-based licensing system includes the licensing life cycle from initial application, license issuance, amendment, reporting, and de-licensing. Designed to maintain information on NRC material licensees, it is planned to support an interface for inclusion of licensing information from 36 Agreement States which support and manage their own material licenses. In addition, this requirement entails developing a web-based interface for materials Licensees; and replacing while improving upon the functionality currently embodied in several of the NRC's legacy systems; namely, the License Tracking System (LTS), the Inspection Planning System (IPS), Reciprocity Tracking System (RTS), and Transportation Approval Package Information System, (TAPIS). WBL is a Level 3 system and has a "Moderate" security categorization.</p>
<p>License Verification System (LVS)</p>
<p>The License Verification System (LVS) is envisioned as a "national verification system" that would access NRC and Agreement State licensee information and be used for purposes of detecting and preventing unauthorized parties with malicious intent from obtaining nuclear materials. The LVS is planned to be an integrated service that shall broker information stored in WBL and NSTS to provide the validations to ensure that (a) a license is valid and accurate; (b) a licensee is authorized for acquiring quantities and types of radioactive materials; and (c) the current levels of licensee inventory tracked sources is within the possession limits. The LVS will be designed to handle request transactions for validation functions. It shall work in much the same way as the approval process for a credit card purchase. When a merchant checks to verify a credit card the only information returned is whether or not the transaction is approved. LVS will take in the validation request and, through examination of information available from both NSTS and WBL, will provide a response indicating whether or not a license is valid and a pending purchase is within the bounds of the possession limits and inventory. LVS is a Level 3 system that has a "Moderate" security categorization.</p>
<p><br />Under this requirement, the contractor shall perform development, testing, training, and deployment of the LVS and WBL systems; and Maintenance and Operational (M&amp;O) support, user support, and hosting of LVS, WBL, and NSTS. The contractor shall comply with all Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) guidance for Level 4 authentication. The facility shall provide general hosting and operational support for a system requiring High confidentiality, High integrity, and High Availability. All hardware and software shall comply with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 2. The hosting infrastructure shall include at least two geographically disparate sites to provide remediation from emergencies. The system shall employ a multi-tiered web architecture with levels of redundancy to ensure automatic failover.</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that the contract will be a labor hour type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance of the resultant contract will be 10 years (one base period of 4 years and three additional two-year optional periods.<br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about July 31, 2009 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.</p>
<p><br />The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be under NAICS code 541519. Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.</p>

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Alaska Science Center, has a need for an oceanographic research vessel charter for support of Walrus Radio-Tagging in the Chukchi Sea.  The vessel will be chartered for a maximum of 10 days between 10 July and 24 July 2010.  The vessel will provide transportation and support for the science crew of 6 people working for USGS and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS).
The objective of the cruise will be to deploy satellite-linked radio-tags from small workboats on walruses within the sea ice margin.  One workboat will be provided by USGS for the field work and must be loaded onto the charter vessel in Nome, Alaska.  The vessel will be required to transit to Nome, board the science crew and continue to the work area by about July 12, 2010.  The work area will be northwestern Chukchi Sea at the southern end of the retreating pack ice.  The estimated location of the initial target area will be 50 nautical miles west of Barrow, but is ultimately dependent on sea ice conditions and walrus distributions at the time.  Vessel must meet U.S. Coast Guard standards for an "oceanographic research vessel" for safe operations offshore in the Arctic Ocean.  Name, proof of U.S. Coast Guard license, proof of insurance, and a description of the watercraft experience of the Captain.  Captain shall have at least 3 years experience operating watercraft of the size being offered in the following specific regions: ice-bearing waters of the North Pacific or Arctic Oceans. 
A fixed price type purchase order is contemplated for this requirement. Competitive procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, will be utilized. This competition is a small business set-aside under NAICS 483114 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is the best value to the government.  Vessel suitability as determined by a USGS project leader/inspector will be a main factor in selecting the contract vessel.  The Government reserves the right to make award to other than the low offeror.  It is anticipated that a Request for Quote (RFQ) will be issued and posted to this site on or about May 13, 2010 with proposals due on or about May 21, 2010.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  This notice and any resulting RFQ and/or purchase order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-40, effective April 22, 2010.  THIS ACQUISITION IS SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS

<p>3.0 Description</p>
<p>ASC is seeking information to determine the most cost-effective acquisition strategy to fulfill the need for 19 glider aircraft by March 2010 to replace the existing fleet of basic and aerobatic training gliders used in the USAFA Soaring Program. Existing USAFA facilities will be used for aircraft storage and maintenance, however the aircraft will be maintained under a separate Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) arrangement. (Note: If you are unable to meet the 1 Mar 2010 suspense your response is still welcomed. However, in your response please provide data explaining why you are unable to meet the suspense and offer your proposed delivery timetable.)</p>
<p>The current aircraft requirement is for basic (14 each) and aerobatic model (5 each) non-powered sailplane gliders, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified aircraft suitable for basic soaring training. Due to the urgency of the timeline, it is preferred that the aircraft supplied be currently in production or in-stock, however, ASC remains open to other suitable acquisition options that are able to meet timeline requirements. Also, while it is preferred that a single manufacturer provide both the basic and aerobatic aircraft for standardization of training and maintenance purposes, the Air Force is fully dedicated to fair and open competition, and as such there is no requirement that a single manufacturer be able to produce both aircraft.</p>
<p>4.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>Written Responses - Responses must address the following overall characteristics/constraints. (Detailed minimum characteristics for the aircraft can be found in Annex 1.)</p>
<p>4.1 Provide, in English, a pilot operating handbook (POH) or FAA approved airplane flight manual or an equivalent document containing aircraft weight, performance and technical data for the aircraft as part of the SSS/CRFI response package. Your response package should include these documents and any other documents necessary to address the following data points:</p>
<p>4.1.1 Three-view aircraft drawing with dimensions</p>
<p>4.1.2 Wing span, wing area, maximum L/D, minimum sink rate, max permitted speed, minimum speed, max maneuvering speed, max load factor, max empty weight, max gross weight and glide ratio</p>
<p>4.2 Comment on your proposed delivery timetable. Provide information on availability lead time after contract award, and whether all aircraft will be available in one lot or multiple lots (if multiple lots, provide quantities and timing). (Note: The desire is to have all aircraft on the USAFA ramp by 1 March 2010.)</p>
<p>4.3 Provide list price ($) of each aircraft, total procurement cost of all aircraft, typical operating cost and cost of any additional required equipment (avionics, etc.) needed onboard the aircraft in order to meet the minimum aircraft characteristics listed in Annex 1. Include cost data for trailers for both basic and aerobatic glider models.</p>
<p>4.4 Provide projected airframe service life, maintenance hours per flight hour and comment on any special maintenance considerations required, i.e. custom tooling, etc. Note that desired aircraft service life is 15 years or 7,500 hours for the basic glider and 15 years or 2,250 hours for the aerobatic glider. Assume 500 average annual flight hours per basic model aircraft, and 150 average annual flight hours per aerobatic aircraft.</p>
<p>4.5 Comment on technical data availability for purchase and parts licensing information. Also comment on ability to provide engineering services and engineering data, and the ability to provide spare parts, as required throughout the expected service life of the glider.</p>
<p>4.6 Comment on the overall durability of the glider with regard to operations at USAFA, noting the following:</p>
<p>&#61656; Student's in the introductory AM-251 program have a low level of flight experience. In many cases, the student will be making their first flight in an aircraft.</p>
<p>&#61656; The ops tempo is very high as is typical in any flying training program. Approx 200 total glider sorties may be flown in a day. A normal sortie for AM-251 (basic glider) is 0.3 hours. This leads to the average basic glider completing approximately 3-4 landings per flight hour.</p>
<p>&#61656; All sorties are launched via aerotow</p>

<p>7.0 Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS) / CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (CRFI) ONLY to identify sources and acquisition options to acquire 19 aircraft in support of a non-powered flight program at the USAFA. The information provided in the SSS/CRFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. ASC has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this SSS/CRFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
<p>ANNEX 1</p>
<p>1.0 MINIMUM AIRCRAFT CHARACTERISTICS: Aircraft must meet all of the minimum characteristics/measurable capabilities listed below.</p>
<p>1.1 Dual Seat Basic Training Glider (14 each). FAA certification is mandatory. Minimum useful load of 440 pounds is mandatory. Basic flight instruments in the front and rear cockpits are mandatory. Must be spin certified. All other requirements are stated below and in the System Capabilities and Characteristics Parameters Matrix.</p>
<p>1.2 Dual Seat Aerobatic Training Glider (5 each). FAA certification is mandatory. Basic flight instruments in the front and rear cockpits are mandatory. Minimum useful load of 440 pounds is mandatory. Must be spin certified. All other requirements are stated below and in the System Capabilities and Characteristics Parameters Matrix.</p>
<p>1.3 System Performance. All missions will be accomplished in day, Visual Meteorological Conditions with up to reported continuous moderate turbulence. Aerobatics and spin training sorties may be limited to reported light to occasional moderate turbulence. Minimum turn time between glider sorties may not exceed 5 minutes.</p>
<p>1.4 Logistics and Readiness. The fleet should be able to meet an 75% fully mission capable rate on any given day (Contract Logistics Support requirement). It should be possible to complete aircraft annual inspections within three man-days, 100-hour or phased inspections within two man-days.</p>
<p>1.5 Maintenance Planning. All maintenance and logistics support must fall under the existing Contract Logistics Support (CLS), USAFA airfield maintenance and fuel contracts. No other programmed support, i.e. depot level maintenance, or Air Force organic maintenance, can be required. For the lifetime of the incoming system it is anticipated that commercial contractors will provide maintenance support. Maintenance schedules must be supplied by the manufacturer and in accordance with FAA certification guidelines. Additionally, 100 hour or phased inspections are desired. The aircraft manufacturer must be capable of providing complete logistics support including spare parts, engineering services and engineering data (in English) throughout the expected service life.</p>
<p>1.6 Support Equipment. Trailers should be available as standard support equipment for gliders. Aircraft must be deployable in trailers towed by &frac12; ton trucks with standard US ball hitches.</p>
<p>All glider maintenance should be accomplished with use of common support equipment (inclusive of hand tools) and provided in sufficient quantities to support all glider maintenance. Development of peculiar support equipment shall be scrutinized and held to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p>1.7 C4I &amp; Other Standardization, Interoperability, and Commonality. Two-way VHF radios with a frequency range of 118.00 to 136.975 MHz selectable in 25 kHz intervals are required. Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) are required in all new aircraft acquisitions and are required to be 406 MHz compliant. Transponders (IFFs) are required in all new aircraft acquisitions.</p>
<p>1.8 Computer Resources. The glider must be equipped with a flight data recorder capable of interfacing with an existing Personal Computer (PC) based system that has the ability to track and maintain a database of aircraft flying hours for maintenance contract billing purposes. Existing computer capabilities (inclusive of facilities, hardware, software and support) are sufficient to support all requirements of the new gliders procured under the Soaring Program. No new or additional computer resources will be required.</p>
<p>1.9 Human Systems Integration</p>
<p>1.9.1 Gliders must be operable by non-rated Air Force personnel who meet the minimal medical screening requirements for incentive flights. A 440-pound minimum useful load is required to allow heavier cadets to participate in the program. A useful load of 440-pounds allows a nominal 180-pound instructor to fly with a student as heavy as 260 pounds. Additionally, objective weights allow us to include all cadets from the 5th percentile female to the 95th percentile male.</p>
<p>1.10 Other Logistics and Facilities Considerations. All aircraft will be based at the USAF Academy and housed in existing hangars. Current facilities, supplied and supported by the USAF, house the existing glider fleet and are sufficient to house the new fleet. No new infrastructure is required. The maintenance contractor will use existing or developed FAA-approved maintenance manuals. The maintenance contractor with direct consultation of the manufacturer will accomplish any requirement for specialized maintenance training. Maintenance support of the gliders will be accomplished by licensed A&amp;P mechanics (released to fly after annuals by A&amp;Ps with Inspector Authorization.) No specialized maintenance technical orders can be required. No new military occupational specialties can be required. All aircrew training will be organic to the 306th Flying Training Group. Trailers should be weather resistant and capable of outside storage in Colorado with no significant corrosion or maintenance support.</p>
<p>1.11 Geospatial Information and Services. Sectional Aeronautical Charts meet all cartographic requirements.</p>
<p>1.12 Natural Environmental Support. State-of-the-science weather support is required to optimize mission effectiveness while minimizing risk to resources and personnel. All airfield weather observation, forecasting, and aircrew briefing requirements are met by the current USAFA Airfield Contract weather support. A contract will be in effect throughout the projected lifetime of the new aircraft and is a cost-effective way to satisfy the environmental support requirements.</p>
<p>1.13 Seat design should be flexible enough to allow pilots to fly with or without parachutes, as applicable, and still be able to operate flight controls.

<SUBJECT>Wright Patterson AFB, Hyperbaric Chamber
<SOLNBR>AFRPA-10-R-0016

<DESC>The Department of Air Force (Air Force) requests an expression of interest from industry participants (hospitals, hyperbaric chamber managers, etc.) that are experienced and capable of operating, staffing, and maintaining a large capacity hyperbaric chamber. The Air Force seeks information regarding potential operation of the chamber or terms of an operating agreement parties would require in order for parties to fully analyze and make proposals for the opportunity, as well as questions and concerns market participants might have about it. Please see the list of questions below. The Air Force will consider other approaches to this business opportunity and respondents are encouraged to submit alternative business models to improve the return to the Air Force. Please submit any questions or additional information you would like included in a solicitation, should this project proceed.
<p>Background: <br />The Air Force is considering the merits of leasing the hyperbaric chamber located at the Wright-Patterson AFB Medical Center (WPMC) along with approximately 2,300 sq. ft. of associated office and patient care space for use as a private hyperbaric chamber operation. The chamber consists of three independent but interconnected chambers with a capacity of 18 patients in the main chamber, 3 patients in the second and 1 patient in the third chamber. The system is operational, well maintained, and offers many advanced features including mixed gas delivery and monitoring capabilities. The hyperbaric chamber at Wright-Patterson AFB is the only Air Force chamber being considered for lease. <br />The Air Force anticipates an initial 5 year lease with subsequent renewal options in a landlord/tenant relationship under the authority of 10 USC &sect; 2667, which authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to out-lease non-excess real property. The WPMC would not provide staff, supplies or medical services for patient treatments, except in an emergency. The lessee would staff and manage the chamber and build its own patient base and hyperbaric and wound care practice, independently of WPMC. As a portion of the in-kind consideration, the operator would treat DoD personnel without charge (in the last 2 years, DoD patients were less than 2% of all treated patients). Civilian treatments would be on an outpatient basis, (only TRICARE beneficiaries and civilian emergency cases would have access to WPMC).</p>
<p>Expression of Interest Desired:<br />The Air Force is interested in gauging the interest of qualified multi-place chamber operators to privately manage, maintain and operate the chamber for civilian patients and provide a return to the Air Force of cash and other in-kind consideration equal to or greater than the fair market value of the asset. Please include in your response to this Request for Information, detailed answers to the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. WPMC, as a military hospital, cannot bill Medicare. The lessee may need to arrange a partnership with a health care facility with a Medicare ID number or provide its own alternative method to bill Medicare. Provide your anticipated method.<br />2. Provide information on your marketing plan and timeline to (a) achieve profitable status, and (b) achieve your ultimate patient load level. <br />3. Describe your suggested method of calculating, and the timeline of lease payments and/or other in-kind consideration that provides the Air Force with the greatest return.<br />4. Provide your total estimated annual lease payment projections, during the initial term of the lease, to the Air Force generated by hyperbaric treatments and wound care. <br />5. Provide your desired term of the initial lease and renewal options.<br />6. Provide information on your entity's experience in operating and maintaining multi-place chambers and the experience and training of the primary personnel that might be involved.<br />7. WPMC has established a proven, convenient method of providing patient access through the gate and to the hospital. Describe concerns, challenges or issues in operating the WPMC chamber.<br />8. The Air Force anticipates the training of 1-3 hyperbaric fellows annually; describe your ability and qualifications to provide such training.<br />9. Provide information on how you anticipate offering after hour emergency treatments. <br />10. Privileging/Credentials cannot be provided by WPMC to the operator and would therefore need to be obtained from a partnering hospital or other entity. Describe your approach to obtaining the Privileging/Credentials or how this will be an obstacle.<br />11. Include any other information that might help the Air Force understand and evaluate your interest and capabilities in this potential business opportunity.</p>
<p>Handling and Processing:<br />All responses received will be considered. Under this Request for Information or under future issuances, the Air Force may terminate or continue to pursue this topic. The Air Force will use competition to pursue any leases, agreements, etc. that may be issued as a result of this endeavor. All responses received may be held for an extended period of time or destroyed; they will not be returned to the originator. Please mark all information that you desire or require to be handled as proprietary or as confidential business information and it will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>This Request for Information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information. The Government shall not be liable for any consequential damages a submitter may suffer for any improperly identified proprietary information.</p>

<SUBJECT>Sustainable Aspects of Asphalt and Concrete Pavements in the Design, Construction, Repair, and Rehabilitation of Highway Pavements
<SOLNBR>DTFH61-10-R-00017
<RESPDATE>031810
<CONTACT>Daniel Confer, Email daniel.confer@dot.gov
<DESC>Potential Sources Sought. This is not a RFP.
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for an anticipated contract to advance the knowledge of sustainable aspects of asphalt and concrete pavements and the use of life cycle assessment as a tool in the design, construction, repair and rehabilitation of highway pavements. A strategic outcome of this effort will be to increase the body of knowledge regarding sustainability aspects of asphalt and concrete materials in pavement design and construction and to increase the use of sustainable technologies and practices. The effort will consist of four distinct yet related parts:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Part A:</strong> Evaluate available tools that utilize the life cycle assessment framework, which could be used for assessing the "carbon footprint" of highway pavements. Such tools should demonstrate the effect of various pavement design parameters on the environmental performance of a given pavement throughout its service life. Following pavement type selection, for asphalt and concrete pavements, a desirable assessment tool would provide feedback concerning the incorporation of design features that would affect not only the load-carrying ability, durability characteristics, and service life of the pavement; but also, its carbon footprint. The product of this effort would be a report describing and evaluating available tools which could be used, or adapted for use, to assess the carbon footprint of pavements.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Part B:</strong> Establish a technical working group (TWG), which will provide technical input to FHWA on sustainability and environmental issues pertaining to the design, construction, repair and rehabilitation of highway pavements. The TWG will include stakeholders from FHWA, other Federal agencies (EPA, etc.), academia, industry, and state departments of transportation.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Part C: </strong>Develop guidance documents discussing sustainable practices for the design, construction, repair and rehabilitation of highway pavements. Documents may include reports, manuals, and/or handbooks for the implementation of such practices.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Part D:</strong> Evaluate existing tools that may be used for assessing the sustainability of highway pavements. Factors included in the assessment should include, but not be limited to, construction materials as well as design and construction practices. The FHWA Office of Pavement Technology has ongoing programs to develop and transfer new technologies related to improved pavement performance. The products resulting from this effort will be incorporated into those programs for demonstration and implementation.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Offerors will be expected to have capabilities in:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span>&bull;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Technical and engineering - pavements - Capabilities to fully understand the technical aspects of highway pavement systems and to convey that knowledge to other parties including but not limited to engineers, contractors and agency/owners of roadways.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span>&bull;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Technical and engineering - life cycle assessment - Capabilities to fully understand the technical aspects of life cycle assessment and to convey that knowledge to other parties including but not limited to engineers, contractors and agency/owners of roadways.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span>&bull;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Communications and marketing - Capabilities to develop, maintain and utilize a variety of contact lists to facilitate the timely transfer of information, including feedback from other parties including but not limited to engineers, contractors and agency/owners of roadways. Other capabilities that would be considered useful include editorial and document production services.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span>&bull;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Project management and reporting - Capabilities to perform and/or direct the efforts of technical, engineering, communications, and marketing staff.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Timely and cost-effective performance in each of the 4 areas above is required.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The estimated period of performance for the project is five years.&nbsp; The level of activity&nbsp;and staffing requirements for this project&nbsp;will&nbsp;depend&nbsp;on the funding provided under current and future transportation legislation. Potential staffing may include the following: project manager, principal investigator, senior engineer, technology deployment specialist, economist, technical assistant, meeting facilitator, and administrative assistant.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE: Any interested organizations are invited to submit a Capability Statement by e-mail to daniel.confer@dot.gov no later than 3:00pm local time on March 18, 2010. Capability Statements shall clearly identify the following items regarding the interested organization(s): (1) name and address of prospective organization(s); (2) size and socio-economic status; (3) technical capabilities to perform the work; (4) relevant experience and credentials; (5) synopsis of experience and expertise of potential staff; (6) relevant projects completed related to the anticipated objectives of the project with information on the client, scope, and products; and (7) a description of available facilities to perform the work outlined above.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is an agency under the United States Department of Commerce (DOC) with headquarters located in Alexandria, Virginia.  The mission of the USPTO is to administer the laws and regulations related to patents and trademarks in order to promote industrial and technical progress in the United States and strengthen the national economy.  The USPTO carries out its mission by examining patent and trademark applications, issuing patents and registering trademarks, disseminating patent and trademark information to the public and by encouraging a domestic and international climate in which intellectual property can flourish.

The USPTO has multiple legal offices within the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) that provide administrative and intellectual property law support for the agency.  These offices currently use a variety of automated systems and manual processes to manage the legal cases and matters.  The OGC organization needs a unified, legal case management solution for these organizations to use.  

 This RFI seeks to obtain information from interested parties, including the vendor community, about potential opportunities to acquire commercial off the shelf (COTS) legal-specific software for the USPTO.  This software is required to allow OGC organizations to manage their legal cases and matters from inception to completion.  This software will need to be a turn-key solution and not require modification from the vendor to implement.  The vendor will provide installation assistance; administrator and end-user training; and additionally perform a data migration of cases from our current case management system.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. Potential sources are expected to review this notice to familiarize themselves with the requirements.
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau is seeking potential sources capable of providing the necessary scientific and logistical expertise, personnel, materials, facilities, and equipment necessary to provide further development support of a mathematical model as described below.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>When President George W. Bush announced the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003, he stated, "This comprehensive plan will prevent 7 million new 'AIDS' infections, treat at least 2 million people with life-extending drugs, and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS, and for children orphaned by AIDS." The estimation of infections averted, therefore, was one of the first quantifiable demands placed upon the strategic information component of the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC). However, as the number of HIV infections averted is intrinsically a non-event and cannot be measured directly, it must be estimated through an indirect means, such as mathematical modeling.</p>
<p>In 2004, a group made up of representatives from various U.S. government agencies and nongovernmental groups reviewed a variety of models available to estimate new HIV infections averted. Based on recommendations from the group it was decided that the Census Bureau would be tasked with modeling the number of infections averted for the fifteen PEPFAR focus countries.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau model calculates baseline projections of HIV incidence for countries using demographic and HIV prevalence data obtained prior to 2005, the time period before intervention programs were widely instituted. This baseline serves as a reference for future comparisons. Subsequently, these incidence trends are re-estimated for countries with additional epidemiological antenatal clinic surveillance data and/or new demographic data available for years post-2004. The re-estimated trends in incidence, compared to the baseline, represent the net impact of all changes implemented with international support from PEPFAR and the Global Fund. The difference in the number of new HIV infections implied by the prevalence levels will be taken as the number of infections averted.</p>
<p>With the reauthorization of PEPFAR in 2008, the U.S. government set forth goals to treat at least 3 million people, prevent 12 million new HIV infections, and care for 12 million people, including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children through September 30, 2013 in 31 countries and the Caribbean region. As in the first phase of PEPFAR, PEPFAR Phase II continues to place emphasis on the prevention of new HIV infections and quantifying that effort. Since there has been such an influx of funding going towards prevention efforts to stem the tide of the disease, there is now a strong need to tie program effectiveness with the prevention of further HIV infection.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The improved mathematical model is required to:</p>
<p>&bull; Apply to a wide range of different HIV epidemics. This includes generalized, concentrated, and low-level epidemics.</p>
<p>&bull; Represent the heterosexual transmission of HIV in a sexual-activity stratified population aged 15-49 years.</p>
<p>&bull; Include the ability to represent different phases of HIV infection, produce realistic rates of disease progression and death, and include the use and scale-up of anti-retroviral drugs.</p>
<p>&bull; Incorporate observed trends in behavioral indicators over time. These model parameters that pertain to sexual or other at-risk behaviors can be estimated from available data. Much of this information comes from population-based surveys and cohort studies in African populations that are found in the scientific literature. Model parameters that have reliable information include condom use, mean rate of partner change, number of sexual acts, rate of HIV transmission per sex act, and survival with HIV. Parameters with a paucity of information include variance in sexual risk behavior, sexual mixing patterns, and high-risk group replacement.</p>
<p>&bull; Output uncertainty intervals using a Bayesian framework for all parameter values that allow for quantification of conclusions drawn, estimate timing of behavior change, and HIV infections averted.</p>
<p>&bull; Allow for future incorporation of new parameters as epidemics evolve. For example, biomedical interventions that reduces the rate of HIV transmission, such as male circumcision and herpes simplex virus 2 suppression need to be incorporated into the model at some point in the future.</p>
<p>&bull; Represent a proven and previously used model that addresses the same issue of linking behavior change to changes in HIV epidemics.</p>
<p>&bull; Be provided in a computer program that is compatible with the Microsoft Windows environment and meet all requirements of the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) regulations. However, this does not imply a plan to produce a widely distributable software package.</p>
<p>&bull; Be exportable to Microsoft Excel and also be available as a comma separated value (CSV) file.</p>
<p>Capability Statements:<br /><br />Potential sources capable of providing the necessary scientific and logistical expertise for an improved mathematical model should submit a brief capability statement. All capability statements should:</p>
<p>1. Not exceed and will be restricted up to eight (8) pages.</p>
<p>2. Be electronically submitted to the email address below.</p>
<p>3. Include small business classification(s): (small business, 8(a), HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged business, Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned business, and Women Owned business) in your submission, if applicable.</p>
<p>4. List references and experience in conducting similar projects for the past 3-5 years.</p>
<p>The Government intends to consider all comments and the responsive qualification packages when developing its final acquisition strategy and resulting RFP(s). The synopsis, amendments and other information related to this sources sought as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on FedBizOpps' website. All interested parties should check this site frequently for updates. All information related to this procurement will be available at this link through the date of any award.</p>
<p>In the event an RFP is issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541720 with a size standard of $7.0M is being considered.</p>
<p>Please submit all Capability Statements by 5:30 P.M. EST on May 21, 2010 via email to: Donna Cornish, Contract Specialist at donna.cornish@census.gov. <br />NO FAXES, MAIL OR PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED</p>

Pricing:
Any resulting order that is established as a result of this notice will be separately priced and negotiated and include appropriate terms and conditions consistent with applicable regulations.

Response Due Dates:
Pre-proposals will be accepted until May 31, 2010 at 11:59 pm EST. Proposals will be accepted until June 27, 2010 at 11:59 pm EST. Proposals will be evaluated and considered for funding on a continual basis through May 31, 2010 and June 27, 2010, respectively. 

Background
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury, is the primary regulator of all nationally chartered banking institutions. The OCC is responsible for promoting the safety and soundness of the countrys national banking system and maintaining its competitiveness, efficiency, integrity and stability in the financial marketplace.


Research Opportunity Description: 
The OCC established this Research Initiative to maintain its support for high-quality research on modeling issues related to valuations and risk measurement that arise from the use of complex non-experimental and often incomplete data  data typically used by banks to develop risk models for trading, asset liability management, asset management, credit scoring, compliance, operation risk, underwriting, account management, risk management, and regulatory capital purposes. 

Banks have been using statistical models for several decades, however, until recently their models were developed using relatively simplistic statistical modeling techniques. With the recent advancements in computing technology and the increased availability of loan-level data, banks are developing models that incorporate advances in theoretical and applied modeling procedures. These include more complex sample designs and innovative estimation techniques that rely on advanced statistical, econometric and information theoretic techniques. With the introduction of new techniques, however, the risk of model failure increases until the procedure and techniques as applied to banking are thoroughly tested and evaluated and verified by an independent review process.

Although the primary responsibility for assessing the suitability of these models rests with each individual bank as part of their validation processes, bank supervisors increasingly will be required to understand the technical details of these models and, when warranted, recommend adjustments or enhancements to the model design as part of the supervisory process. At the OCC, examiners rely on the economists in the Risk Analysis Divisions (RAD) to review these models and provide expert opinions regarding their use to OCC examiners and bank staff; and to train OCC examiners on certain aspects of model-risk analysis. However, advances in risk-model techniques are developing quickly due to market reliance on risk-based pricing, the need to value portfolios of securitized loans, and the inclusion of risk measurement tools under the Basel II Capital accord. Many of the techniques under consideration by banks are too new or too specialized to be studied within the traditional university framework. One mechanism to further the OCCs ability to review these models and provide expert opinions is represented by this broad agency announcement. 

The OCCs Research Initiative is seeking proposals that would provide an environment for cooperative research across multiple disciplines on joint work with applied researchers from such fields as business, economics, statistics, and finance to investigate alternative methods of developing models when the structure of the data is less than ideal. The objectives of the OCC Research Initiative is to develop an ongoing partnership with established research centers to engage in state-of-the-art research on data analysis, integrating econometrics, statistics and information theory; disseminate research findings using a variety of mediums to inform the academic community, policymakers, and the public; and provide training and funding support for graduate students and postgraduates to conduct research related to its research program.  For all proposals submitted to the OCC, the OCC must ensure that the Contractor does not have a conflict of interest and is not biased because of its financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests that relate to the work under the proposal.  A conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the persons objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair advantage.  A proposal to the OCCs Research Initiative should address one or more of the following:


1. Research, evaluation and data development.  The research program should focus on developing new ideas and new methods to analyze complex or incomplete and limited data. Providing researchers with financial and intellectual support to carry on that research and foster an exchange of ideas. 

2. Dissemination. Organizing and conducting conferences and workshops on special topics related to relevant research.

3. Training and education. Providing short courses, workshops, and training sessions in all areas of econometrics and statistical modeling. 

Reporting Requirements:
Each award shall include the required technical and financial reporting requirements as described in paragraph 4 of Section V. 

Point(s) of Contact and Questions: 
Comments or questions submitted should be concise and reference the relevant part and paragraph of the BAA. Please take caution when submitting questions containing proprietary or sensitive information.

Questions shall be directed to:
Acquisitions Management, Point of Contact, 
Catherine A. Gleasman, Contract Specialist, via email at Catherine.Gleasman@occ.treas.gov

Or 

Marguerite G. Brown, Contracting Officer, Pre  Award Team Lead, via email Marguerite.Brown@occ.treas,gov 

II. AWARD INFORMATION

It is anticipated that the awards will be made in the form of purchase orders. The awards will be made at funding levels commensurate with how the proposals meet the evaluation criteria in Section V and in response to agency missions. Each individual award will be individually negotiated.  The OCC may establish a deadline for the close of fact-finding and negotiations that allows a reasonable time for award of a contract.  Firms may be removed from award consideration should the parties fail to reach agreement on contract terms, conditions and/or cost/price within a reasonable time.  

III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION

This BAA is open to institutions of higher education (universities) with degree-granting programs.  Entities organized under section 501(c)4 of the Internal Revenue Code that engage in lobbying are not eligible.

IV. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION

1. General Information 
The pre-proposals and proposals submitted under this BAA are expected to address the objectives of the research initiative. The proposal submissions will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with applicable laws, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and OCC terms and conditions. Offerors are expected to appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information. 

The proposal submission process has two stages.

Stage 1 - Prospective offerors are encouraged to submit pre-proposals to minimize the labor and cost associated with the production of detailed proposals that have very little chance of being selected for award. OCC will review all pre-proposals received prior to the deadline (5/31/2010 at 11:59 p.m. EST). Based on an assessment of the pre-proposal, the OCC will provide prospective recipients a recommendation to either submit a full proposal or to not submit a full proposal. 

Stage 2 - OCC will evaluate all proposals received prior to the deadline (6/27/2010 at 11:59 p.m. EST).  All proposals submitted under the terms and conditions cited in this BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated herein. 

Both pre-proposals and proposals should address any intellectual property issues related to the proposal, e.g. licensing and copyright of information.

2. Submission of Pre-proposals

Pre-proposals shall be submitted electronically to Catherine.Gleasman@occ.treas.gov. The email subject line should contain the following: Tcc-10-HQ-BA-0001.

Evaluation of Pre-Proposals

Pre-proposals will be reviewed by a subject matter expert who is a Government employee. The subject matter expert will make a recommendation to the firm as to whether a full proposal is warranted based on the pre-proposal submission.

3. Submission of a Full Proposal
Proposals shall be submitted electronically to Catherine.Gleasman@occ.treas.gov. The email subject line should contain the following: Tcc-10-HQ-BA-0001.

An offeror may submit a pre-proposal and/or full proposal prior to registering, however an award will not be made until the offeror has registered (see Section VI). Applicants who are not registered with CCR should allow at least 21 days to complete these requirements. It is suggested that the process be started upon initial pre-proposal submission. Questions regarding CCR registration may be directed to the OCC Point of Contact. 

5. Pre-proposal and Full Proposal Receipt Notices
Acknowledgement of receipt of a pre-proposal and/or proposal under this BAA will be accomplished via email to the addressee approximately one week after submission.

6. Late Submission of Pre-proposals and Proposals

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.  
The Defense Contracting Service Office (Philadelphia) (DCSO-P) seeks your expression of interest and any suggestions regarding DCSOs desire to establish service support of software/maintenance commercial-off-the-shelf product/solution for Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS) stations worldwide.

This prospective initiative will encompass a next-generation, web-based order management and print workflow solution. The delivery model that best fits DAPS needs is licensed software. Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) is the preferred products. This solution gives ownership and operation of the solution to the Government. Common industry terminologies used to describe similar systems are print e-business and web to print. The goal is to obtain information from vendors who can provide DAPS with innovative, cost-effective, reliable, state-of-the-art solutions and industry capabilities that would fulfill its requirements which are currently being satisfied by the existing solution called DAPS On-Line. DOL is a homegrown application developed using IT services offered through government contracts. A detailed functional, workflow and architectural description of DAPS Online solutions is explained later in this paragraph. DAPS Online is in the sustainment phase of its program life cycle. Yearly evaluation of the technology market resulted in the conclusion that many web to print vendors were able to offer licensed products that would exceed the existing inhouse functionality at an affordable cost of entry. 

DAPS and DAPS customers are satisfied with the functionality provided in the present DOL system.  However, we are seeking all vendors who can provide a COTS solution that meets the existing functionality and provides additional capabilities with their out of box solution. The government realizes, due to our unique requirements, that there will be some RICE items (reports, interfaces, conversions and extensions). These are expected to be minimal. 

.DAPS Online is the primary online tool for customers to access DAPS services. This tool was home-grown and has evolved over the past 11 years. Home-grown is used to describe a system that was developed using a Government contractor based on government requirements. Its origin as a client/server was migrated to a web application in 1998 as internet use became common place. The original tool intent was to provide a means by which customers anywhere can submit their print documents electronically to a DAPS facility anywhere. Additional functionality was added as usage increased and dependency on the system grew. The DAPS Online business model changed and expanded into new business areas. The simple job submission tool now offers new services to customers such as soft proofing while expanding in house utilization by offering workflow for the production plant, and it supplements our financial system with job level Management Information System reports and data.

DAPS Online is a web-based, e-commerce print solution consisting of a customer order, accounting, plant workflow and reports/management modules. The architecture is a single server comprised of the Operating System, web service application, and database and Java application.  Each regional DAPS Office (10 regional office) maintains their own DOL server. Therefore, the enterprise configuration includes 11 independent web servers located at the following DAPS  regional office sites: Pearl Harbor, HI; Jacksonville, FL; Norfolk, VA; Philadelphia, PA; Oklahoma City, OK; San Diego, CA; Great Lakes, IL; Pensacola, FL; Bangor, WA; and Wiesbaden, Germany. Each of these servers supports 3,000 to 4,000 customers within their geographical area. Each server supports 12-20 subordinate print plants that access the submitted orders through their PC internet browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) 6.0 and higher).  

Functionality being requested includes a licensed COTS solution that is scalable and can provide a retail storefront that is customizable for adhoc users, and a catalog system for specific users, browser-based file submission, kitting, job ticketing, job review, job tracking, approval workflow, split shipping, imposition, API for financial interface, live price quoting, browser-based plant user control, template creation, form filling, and production workflow.  This is not an all exclusive.

The following web site provides details on each regional office and the facilities they manage: http://www.daps.dla.mil/Contact/RegionalOffices.aspx. 

DOL is built on Microsoft Windows 2000/2003 Advanced Server, Apache/Tomcat, MS (Structured Query Language) SQL and Java technology. The solution is a single server configuration; therefore the SQL database and web application reside on the same server. All the DOL servers reside on the DLA enterprise network (ETN), inside the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet).  Customers and DAPS Plant users access their DOL server from various network environments. DOL customers are from the .gov, .mil, and .com environments.
 
The Government seeks information on vendors capabilities and ideas for replacing the DAPS current DAPS Online system with a COTS web to print product.  The vendor survey can be obtained by email.   Please send email responses to rosetta.jackson@dla.mil and the market survey questions will be forwarded via email.   Each contract entered into under this prospective program will include maintenance requirements. We anticipate the use of Electronic Commerce. 
The type of contract contemplated for this program is a fixed price contract with one year base and (3) one year options.   
Topics that vendors may wish to address include, but are not limited to:  infrastructure for printing and print-related services, software tools the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of such an initiative; demand models/usage monitoring and replenishment; vendor capabilities.   Submittals cannot exceed 7 pages.  
The Government desires to formulate a Request for Proposal using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subpart 13.5 Test Program for certain commercial  items. Award will be made using best value procedures.   When reviewing proposals Technical will be considered more important than Price in the source selection decision. 
The Contractor will deliver products which will conform to the requirements of  the Performance Work Statement (PWS), provisions,  and will comply with any Department of Defense (DoD) Authorization Act or Appropriation Act restrictions, when applicable, as set forth in Part 225 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS 225). 
Responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is proprietary or represents confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for U.S. Government use only.   However, DSCOs intent is to develop an RFP from the aggregate of the information provided from industry as a whole.

<DESC>Notice Type:Special Notice 
Title:  Notice of Intent to Award Other than Full and Open Competition for Aviation and Maintenance Contract Extension for one year with six month option for services
Contract:DE-AC52-06NA25694

The purpose of this special notice is to post a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition.  The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Service Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, plans to contract by means other than full and open competition per the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) on behalf of the Office of Secure Transportation (OST), Program Office for Aviation Operations (POAO) for the contract that operates and maintains six (6) aircraft for OST/POAO in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  OST/POAO is responsible for the safe and secure transport of nuclear weapons, special nuclear materials, and weapons components between production facilities and Department of Defense facilities via surface and air modes of transportation by Federal agents.  This extension will allow OST/POAO time to sell the DC-9 airplanes and eliminate operations and move toward the implementation of the Boeing 737 aircraft program plan as it transitions from the DC-9 aircraft to the  Boeing 737 aircraft with a commensurate incremental de-scope of the USA Jet Airlines contract as the Boeing 737 assumes the complete operational mission.  As one Boeing 737 aircraft becomes mission capable one DC-9 aircraft will be disposed of and the current services contract will be de-scoped.  
This extension to the current contract is necessary to ensure uninterrupted aviation support to the OST Federal Agent workforce and is necessary to ensure the safe and secure transport of nuclear weapons, special nuclear materials, and weapons components between production facilities and Department of Defense facilities. 
Normally a new competition would be held at the end of the present contract to ensure maintenance and operation of the DC-9 aircraft until the aircraft are sold.  However, due to the nature of OST?s mission and the unique requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration, if this contract is not extended OST/POAO will not be able to meet its mission requirements without substantial duplication of costs. Four issues have significant negative impact:
(1)	The DC-9 airplanes cannot be flown immediately by a successor contractor as it takes a minimum of 120 days for the FAA to include the aircraft on the new company?s operating certificate.(2)	The 120 day time constraint is relevant only if the selected contractor currently holds an operating certificate for the DC-9 aircraft, otherwise the FAA certification period could exceed 180 days.(3)	Only a few airlines currently hold an FAA DC-9 aircraft operating certificate therefore the probability of exceeding the 120 day minimum certification period is very likely.(4)	OST/POAO will be compelled to duplicate costs by paying for aviation services under a lease or per flight payment arrangement to meet its aviation mission requirements at the same time as it?s paying a contractor to maintain the DC-9 aircraft while awaiting FAA certification.
This extension from December 1, 2011, to November 30, 2012, with the six month option will allow OST/POAO sufficient time to award the new maintenance contract; acquire Boeing 737 aircraft; assume the OST/POAO mission with the Boeing 737 aircraft; and dispose of the legacy DC-9 airplanes without duplicative cost for continuing operations.  This contract extension is being pursued to ensure the same level of required aviation services are maintained while implementing the sunrise/sunset program activities.  An uninterrupted and seamless transition is required to ensure that OST/POAO aviation missions do not fail. 
The Contracting Officer shall award the modification to the current contract to meet the government requirement for continued aviation support for one (1) year with one six-month option extension to the current contract DE-AC52-06NA25694 with USA Jet Airlines, Inc. of Belleville, Michigan.
The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirement. The applicable NAICS code is 481211 Nonscheduled Chartered Passenger Air Transportation and the size standard is 1500 employees.  
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES OR A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements, as outlined above may give written notification prior to the response due date.  Responses are required to be submitted before May 28, 2010, 3:00 p.m. Mountain Time.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to csisneros@doeal.gov and supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements listed.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<DESC>RECOVERY - This project is subject to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) regulations and reporting requirements of 2009.  This notice is provided for informational purposes only.  It does not constitute a commitment that the NIAAA or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will undertake a procurement action in this matter. 

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) is planning to solicit and award a contract using ARRA funds to establish a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) capable of conducting all aspects of a multi-center clinical trial for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders using a novel drug candidate, to be determined later.  This contract was originally envisioned as a modification to an existing contract (HHSN275200900005C) with Fast-Track Drugs & Biologics, LLC (5 Paramus Court, North Potomac, MD  20878).  Upon request from the Government, Fast-Track delivered a cost proposal to conduct a clinical investigation to test an additional, unnamed medication in November 2009, based on the contracts Statement of Work (SOW).

The Government has since decided that this work will be competed, and any resulting contract would have an SOW substantially the same as the one attached to this notice, and which is included in the contract awarded to Fast-Track on 15 January 2009.  That SOW is provided here (see attachment) to allow all potential offerors the same access to the SOW that Fast-Track Drugs & Biologics, LLC has had, and to disclose fully this information.

Questions regarding the SOW will be accepted if and when an RFP is issued for this project. 

Questions regarding this notice should be directed in writing to the Primary or Secondary point of contact identified in this notice.

<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the University of Rhode Island for 8 tasks pertaining to the North Pacific Polar Front for a Fisheries And The Environment (FATE) project. The award will be issued to University of Rhode Island c/o Dr. Belkin. Dr. Belkin developed the tester of the algorithm known as the Belkin-O'Reilly algorithm or BOA and has proprietary authorship of the BOA. Given his proprietary authorship of the BOA, his extensive oceanographic field experience (5 years net time at sea, mostly in subpolar and polar regions), his extensive background in analyzing oceanic fronts (29 years with in situ data and 12 years with satellite data), and his peer-reviewed performance on the NPPF (6 articles), Dr. Belkin is the only scientist qualified at this time to provide the required analyses of this project. This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. All sources eligible to provide this supply must respond in writing, response must be supported by clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide services for products outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered an affirmative response. If no responses are received, within 15 days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. Response to this award is to be sent to Heather.mahle@noaa.gov or to fax number (907) 789-6004.</p>

THE INTENT OF THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. 
This is not a Solicitation as the award is an intended Sole Source; however, all responsible
sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.
<p>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40.</p>
<p>This is a small business set-aside. This is an open market combined synopsis/solicitation.</p>

<p>All items shall be delivered within 30 days of award.</p>

Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror who is technically acceptable.</p>

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Offerors must complete annual representations and certifications on-line at https://orca.bpn.gov in accordance with FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Aug 2009). If there are changes to the Annual Representations and Certifications, a written submission is required in accordance with paragraph b(2) of the provision.</p>

<CONTACT>Sharon Weber, Facilities Contract Specialist, Email sharon.k.weber@usps.gov
<DESC>The Eastern Facilities Service Office (EFSO) of the U. S. Postal Service is seeking construction contractors for an Indefinite Quantity Job Order Contract (IQ JOC) for repair and alteration projects at postal facilities in Northern Ohio.  This geographical area is divided into two separate areas:  Area 1 Akron/Cleveland and Area 2 Toledo.  Counties for each area are listed below.  Contractors may pre-qualify for and submit a proposal for one or both areas.  Contractors must be licensed to perform this type of work in the geographic area and must agree to perform work in the entire geographic area for which they seek prequalification and award. 

DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The work includes all labor, materials, equipment and services necessary for a wide range of repair and alteration projects in Postal Service leased or owned facilities.

SOLICITATION: The solicitation will be divided into three parts: 1) qualification; 2) cost proposal, and 3) management plan. The qualification package will be evaluated prior to review of the cost proposal and management plan. Each contractor will be ranked based on Experience, Performance and Capabilities. Only the proposals for the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.

QUALIFICATION: The qualification statements will be evaluated by qualified Postal Service employees and/or Postal Service contracted professionals. Primary factors to be considered are: company background; contract experience; indefinite quantity/job order contract experience; financial stability; capacity to perform - with emphasis on multiple projects at one time; timely completion history; references; bonding capacity; and safety. 

PROPOSAL: Contractors will be required to submit a Management Plan and Cost Proposal. Refer to JOB ORDER CONTRACT below for details regarding the contract type and multipliers. Separate multipliers may be proposed for Area 1 Akron/Cleveland and Area 2 Toledo.  These multipliers will apply for the entire area of each.  Contractors will also be given the option to provide separate multipliers for the Leased Space Accessibility Program (LSAP).     

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: (1) Contractors must be fully licensed to perform construction work in the entire geographic area.  (2) Contractors must have been in the construction business, under the firms present name, for a minimum of five consecutive years.  (3) Contractors must provide proof of bonding with a minimum aggregate dollar amount of $3,000,000 or more.  (4) Contractors must meet minimum computer requirements; i.e., 2.3 GHz, 1 GB Ram, DVD, Windows XP Professional or equal, and high speed internet connection.  (5) Contractors must provide a 24/7 contact name and phone number.

If contractors do not have an office in the geographical area, they must provide information on how the contract would be administered from outside the geographic area. 

JOB ORDER CONTRACT: The contract is a unit price standard type arrangement for a one-year period with four possible one-year renewal options. The initial contract value will be $1,000,000. Performance bonds and payment bonds, as well as a Sub-Contracting Plan, will be required from the successful offeror(s). The contract amount may be increased, by modification and with an appropriate increase in bonding, up to $9,900,000. The minimum work to be ordered under the contract is $10,000. The maximum amount of any work order is $750,000. The work order amount is typically within a range of $10,000 to $150,000.  (The work order amount for LSAP work is typically within a range of $5,000 to $10,000.)  The Postal Service may award multiple contracts for the geographic area. Small, minority-owned, and women-owned subcontracting participation is encouraged.

PRE-PROPOSAL MEETING: A pre-proposal meeting will be held on Friday, May 28, 2010, at 10:00 AM EDT.  The meeting will be held at the USPS Columbus P&DC, 850 Twin Rivers Drive, Room 103A, Columbus OH.  Attendance at this meeting is not mandatory, but is strongly recommended.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 - STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38.
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested quoter's may submit a quote.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Optical Technology Division, is developing measurement methods, standards, and services for spectrally resolved reflectometry of optical materials and requires a broadband source with high spectral power density and laser-like single-mode output, operating over the wavelength range from 450 nm to 2500 nm.</p>
<p>The optical materials to be measured are used as diffuse and specular reflectance standards in government and industry applications. In particular, diffuse reflectors are used in climate monitoring satellites to aid in calibration of on-board spectroradiometers that measure the reflected radiation of earth scenes. These instruments operate over a broad wavelength range from the ultraviolet and visible to the short-wavelength infrared (UV-VIS-SWIR), necessitating calibrations over this wide wavelength range.</p>
<p>As part of an effort to extend current NIST measurement capabilities in the UV-VIS into SWIR wavelengths, light sources which can provide high spectral power densities over these wavelengths are needed. Additionally, highly directional, Gaussian output is required to enable low-loss coupling of light from the source through a monochromator for wavelength selection, and then on to a sample and receiving optics. Recent developments in supercontinuum fiber sources enable these sources to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>The required light source shall, at a minimum, provide power over a continuous spectral range from 450 nm to 2500 nm with the power densities specified within the minimum required specifications of Line Item 0001 below. The output shall be from an optical fiber with single-mode output over the full wavelength range. <br />All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s).

<p>The offeror shall submit a technical capability of meeting or exceeding service agreements for it is proposing, which clearly discusses the technical capability of the offeror providing maintenance support service for the 4700 Proteomics Analyzer. <br />Sub Factor (b) Experience.</p>
<p>Relevant Experience shall be evaluated to determine the extent of the Contractor's experience and knowledge in providing similar Service Agreement. Evaluation of relevant experience may be based on contracts used for past performance; however, the vendor should provide additional references relating to its relevant experience information, if necessary.<br />2. Past Performance<br />The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding all relevant contracts for the PAST 3 YEARS with federal, state or local governments and commercial customers. The information shall describe contracts of similar type and scope as the current requirement.

<p><br />XI. FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (ADDENDUM)<br />The Government intends to award a purchase order to the responsible Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, evaluated cost/price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest-cost/priced Offeror or to the Offeror with the highest technical rating if the Contract Specialist determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.<br />Upon receipt of proposals, the Contract Specialist will review them to determine if each Offeror followed all of the proposal preparation instructions in this solicitation. A proposal that did not follow the proposal submission instructions may be deemed unacceptable and may not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Each proposal will be evaluated against the factors described below. An Offeror's failure to address any factor may be considered indicative of the Offeror's lack of understanding of the Government's requirements and may result in the quotation being determined unacceptable. Technical and Past Performance listed in descending order of importance. Technical and Past Performance, when combined together, are more important than price. The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of equality among quotations of the non-price factors. <br />Options: The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the Government's interest. The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a purchase order without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror's initial quotation should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. <br />Evaluation Factors:<br />1. Technical <br />a) Technical Past Performance<br />Evaluation of technical specification shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed technical capability meets or exceeds the minimum specifications for 4700 Proteomics Analyzer. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed maintenance agreement meets all specifications will not be considered further for award. NIST will also give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed maintenance agreement exceeds NIST's specifications. <br />b). Experience</p>
<p>NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience providing similar maintenance agreement. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same maintenance agreement they are proposing for the current requirement</p>
<p>2. Past Performance<br />The Government will evaluate the Offeror's and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance information to determine its relevance to the current requirements and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. In assessing the offeror's past performance, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. The Government will evaluate past performance by contacting the references selected at random or a specific reference identified by the offeror. The Government will assign a neutral rating to offerors with no relevant past performance.</p>
<p>3. Price<br />The proposed price will be evaluated but not scored. The price evaluation will determine whether the proposed prices are realistic, complete and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements. Proposed prices must be entirely compatible with the technical quotations. Although price is the least important evaluation factor, it will not be ignored<br />XIV. Delivery: <br />1. Delivery shall be FOB Destination to:<br />National Institute of Standards and Technology<br />Building 301 Shipping and Receiving<br />100 Bureau Drive <br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899-001<br />2.

<DESC><p>tThe current Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) System at the Ronald Reagan Building in the Customs and Border Protection space utilizes outdated technology and is in need of an upgrade to facilitate better use of current technology. A system upgrade will allow greater system and monitoring flexibility by use of Internet technology. The use of internet technology will eliminate the need for the use of a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) Keyboard Video Mouse (KVM) matrix switch, analog CCTV matrix switcher, Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) controller, and analog CCTV monitors. The tasks of the obsolete equipment will be accomplished through a TCP/IP scheme with standard office computers with specialized video management software. The use of standard office computers and flat screen monitors will greatly reduce the space currently occupied by obsolete analog equipment. The use of TCP/IP will allow the CCTV system cameras to be viewed from anywhere on the CBP computer network. This will allow the monitoring of pertinent cameras by guard personnel in remote or outlying post where network connections are available.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
 
   (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
 
   (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
 
   (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
 
   (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
 
     (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
 
     (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--
 
         (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
 
         (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
 
         (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
 
       (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
 
     (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
 
     (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
 
     (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
 
   (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
 
   (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

1.  Identification of the service/department:
The VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) Center for Innovative Visual Rehabilitation (CIVR) is developing a novel and portable eye movement recording system and testing the validity of this system by comparing its sensitivity and reliability against traditional laboratory-based (i.e. non-portable) tests.  If successful the members of the research team will perform a feasibility test with the new eye movement system in 10 veterans with traumatic brain injury. The long term goal of this project is to improve the diagnosis of "mild" TBI in our soldiers and veterans.  Tobii appears to be the sole manufacturer of the eye tracker system that possesses the capabilities outlined in paragraph 3 below.  


2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:
The VA Boston Healthcare System Center for Innovative Visual Rehabilitation (CIVR) wishes to purchase a Tobii eye tracker system that provides spatially and temporally sensitive recordings of eye position without the use of methods that require physical contact with the patients.  The Tobii system monitors eye movements with four small cameras that are located at the edges of a monitor that capture the optical reflections from the corneas.  The Tobii system has a 120 Hz data collection rate and has accuracy for eye movements of 0.5 degrees of visual angle.

3.  Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):
  
The Tobii T120 Eye Tracker and Tobii Studio analysis software is a specialized eye tracking system, especially suited for automatic remote eye tracking with minimal obtrusiveness. Research participants are free to move in a natural manner without the constraints or attachments that are part of many eye trackers. 

The eye tracker system must contain the following criteria in order to provide the appropriate level of support to this research.  The Tobii system meets all of these requirements:

1.	System must not require the subject to wear a head-mounted device or to wear apparatus of any type

7.	Must utilize multiple eye tracking sensors simultaneously for accurate Z-value calculations (distance measure must be accurate to 3 mm or better)
8.	System must be capable of completing calibration within seconds
9.	Must integrate eye tracker and monitor into one single device with unobtrusive design
10.	Must perform tracking of 120 fps or faster  
11.	Must perform eye tracking across 24" or larger monitor, with maintained accuracy 1 degree or better also in the extreme corners of the screen at 70 cm distance from user to screen 
12.	Must be robust to maintain tracking despite occlusion of one sensor
13.	Must maintain tracking during 25 cm/s or faster head movement speed
14.	Must be a portable system 
15.	Must be capable of providing:
a.	real-time operator feedback (i.e. gaze position and quality)
b.	online analysis of data into saccades, fixations
16.	System must allow export of data to SPSS, Matlab
17.	System must have operational integration directly with the E-Prime software from PST that allows E-Prime to control the eye tracker
18.	System must include hardware, software and license

Background

The Clinical Center (CC) is a clinical research hospital providing all medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  It is one of 27 institutes and centers that make up NIH. Through clinical research, physician-investigators translate laboratory discoveries into better treatments, therapies and interventions to improve the nation's health. The CC provides patient facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related clinical areas and supervises residency and training programs..

The Office of Clinical Research Training and Medical Education (OCRTME) develops, administers, and evaluates a comprehensive portfolio of clinical research training and medical education initiatives. The Office centralizes many of the existing research training and medical education functions and emphasizes the NIH commitment to developing a cadre of well-trained and highly skilled clinician-scientists. These include programs for medical and dental students, residents and fellows, and the full range of health-care professionals engaged in the clinical and research missions of the NIH and the Clinical Center.

OCRTME maintains web-based applications that are on-line and available to the public through links on OCRTMEs website. These applications gather information on applicants interested in participating in programs administered by OCRTME. They track the personal, qualifying and reference information for each of the programs candidates. Applications are submitted electronically by the interested candidates and assigned to a reviewer electronically. NIH staff review and rate the applications to determine finalists for clinical training programs

The four current web-based applications are:
	The Clinical Electives Program (CEP)
	The Graduate Medical Education (GME)
	The Clinical Research Training Program (CRTP)
	The Resident Electives Program (REP)

These programs accept applications on both a rolling basis and a defined application cycle. The estimated number of annual applications for all 4 programs is 550.  Capabilities include, but are not limited to, the ability for applicants to upload, delete and manage their supporting documents, personal statements, biographical information, academic information, coursework, CVs and resumes and letters of recommendation.  The web-based applications provide program administrators the ability to search, sort and edit applications  by several fields including, but not limited to,  name, school, keyword, city, state, zip code, application status, application submission date.

Section 508 Compliance
	Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) is applicable to this Statement of Work (SOW). The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requires compliance with Section 508 of any contractor 
	or consultant who (1) produces content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) writes, creates or produces any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site.
	
	Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services.
	
	There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Boards Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) 
	comply with the Access Boards standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR).
	
	Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. 
	
	All contractors (including subcontractors) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for 
	use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, 
	and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, 
	shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material.
	
	The contractor is responsible for ensuring compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by evaluating all web pages and web-based applications to ensure they meet all standards prior to going to production. All of these Section 508 provisions apply to all content or communications material identified in this SOW.

Background

The Clinical Center (CC) is a clinical research hospital providing all medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  It is one of 27 institutes and centers that make up NIH. Through clinical research, physician-investigators translate laboratory discoveries into better treatments, therapies and interventions to improve the nation's health. The CC provides patient facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related clinical areas and supervises residency and training programs..

The Office of Clinical Research Training and Medical Education (OCRTME) develops, administers, and evaluates a comprehensive portfolio of clinical research training and medical education initiatives.

Section 508 Compliance
	Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) is applicable to this Statement of Work (SOW). The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requires compliance with Section 508 of any contractor 
	or consultant who (1) produces content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) writes, creates or produces any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site.
	
	Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services.
	
	There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Boards Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) 
	comply with the Access Boards standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR).
	
	Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. 
	
	All contractors (including subcontractors) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for 
	use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, 
	and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, 
	shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material.
	
	The contractor is responsible for ensuring compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by evaluating all web pages and web-based applications to ensure they meet all standards prior to going to production. All of these Section 508 provisions apply to all content or communications material identified in this SOW.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is SAQMMA10Q0134 and is issued as a Request for Quote. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-34. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334119 with a small business size standard of 1,000.00 employees. This requirement is a full and open competitive requirement. 

The Department of State (DoS) Office of Computer Security (CS) uses numerous tools and products to ensure the security posture of the Departments unclassified OpenNet system. One of the critical capabilities required by the Monitoring and Incident Response Division (MIRD) and the Cyber Threat Analysis Division (CTAD) is the ability to capture and store several weeks of complete network packet traffic. This capability allows the Computer Network Defenders (CND) to replay activity on the network to support investigation and remediation of incidents and threats. 

The Department of State requires a commercial product that can perform the following specifications:

The offered solution must be able to: Facilitate Identification of Malicious Email; Provide Enhanced Analytics; Provide Packet Capture Capability; Provide Alerting Capability; Provide anomaly detection capabilities; Provide Insight into Lateral Activity which is defined as moving from resource to resource while conducting malicious behavior;  The offered solution must  Identify Insecure Protocols and Practices; Must  Provide Warning and Indication Capability; Must  Provide Drill-Down Capability for Ambiguous Data; Must Reduce Time Required for Locating and Reconstructing Sessions; Must Comply with Integration and Operational Support Requirements which means it must physically integrate with standard datacenter racks and be supported by standard Datacenter environmental controls (e.g. power (110v) and air conditioning.

The system must monitor traffic flow both inside and outside point-of-presence firewall stacks at two locations.  Interface speeds will be gigabit copper and expect an average of fifty percent utilization.  Full packet capture analysis will be performed using this system with a sixty day data retention requirement.  Physical capture methods will be through both span ports and TAPS.  The system will be centrally managed, but analysis will be done through the user interface from multiple locations.  

Complies with FISMA, OMB A-11 and M-06-15 regulatory mandates.
Tuned for FISMA, NIST FIPS 200, SP-800-37, HSPD #12 requirements.

If your firm offers a commercial product that can meet or exceed the above specifications please respond to this combined synopsis/solicitation and your firms offer will be evaluated using commercial evaluation procedures as outlined in FAR 52.212-2 where technical capability will be more important than price, and technical capability will be more important then all other factors when combined.

Technical Capability - defined as the ability to meet or exceed the performance criteria outlined above.

Delivery Schedule - planned timeline to implement your firm's offer.

<DESC><p dir="ltr">The attached sketch (labeled "Great Seal Mounting Depression", dated 5/12/10) provides information on the area where the Department of State seal is to be mounted. Dimensions on the sketch are in millimeters. The center of the area where the Seal will be mounted is roughly 26 feet above finished floor. There is an area of concrete that is recessed to a depth of roughly 1 inch, and roughly 5 feet in diameter, over which the new Seal is to be installed. Within the depressed area, there are four tie holes that extend through the roughly 19 inch thick concrete wall. There is a plastic plug in each of the tie holes now that could be easily removed. The diameter of the tie holes is roughly 2" for the first 2.25 inches of wall, then narrows to a &frac34;" diameter for the remainder of the wall thickness. These tie holes can be utilized as one potential method of connecting the new Seal to the concrete.</p>

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

35.	Question
Page 44, Item 1A.  How long is the typical job rotational assignment?  How diverse is the geographic scope of these rotations, as it can impact sequencing of events?  Are the rotations similar in scope for each of the cohort participants?

Answer
The majority of job rotations will be in the Frederick, Maryland, and Washington, DC - Baltimore, Maryland, metropolitan area with potential opportunities at various VA facilities across the nation depending on the acquisition support needs of the department.  There are VA facilities in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.  Guided by seasoned professionals, interns will complete job assignments that may take place in Frederick, Maryland, or in the field at a VA facility or VA administrative office.  As the program progresses, the interns will transition from participating in formal coursework to devoting more time to job rotation assignments.  Knowledge is also broadened by visits to VA Medical Centers and meetings with industry representatives.

The length of the job rotation period varies throughout the three year period.  During the first year, typically the rotations last between 1 month and 3  months; during the second year, the rotations typically range between 2 months and 2  months; during the third year, rotations encompass the majority of the year.  The scope of the work the interns participate in during their rotational periods is dependent upon the type of acquisition work being performed at the various locations.

<DESC>This announcement is amended to specify the regions of any resultant regionally based contract(s).&nbsp;This is explanied near the bottom of paragraph 2. Project Information.<br /><br />1. REGIONAL ARCHITECT-ENGINEER SERVICES INDEFINITE DELIVERY CONTRACT INFORMATION. This acquisition is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required for an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) to provide for the primary disciplines of Architecture, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, and Structural. It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded by September 2010. This announcement may result in multiple awards and is restricted to HUBZone businesses only. The Government may award multiple contracts in response to this announcement at any time until one year from the closing date of this announcement. Selection shall be in order of preference from the firms considered Most Highly Qualified. All interested A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent, consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, with small and small, disadvantaged firms. The North American Industry Classification System code for this action is 541330, and the corresponding small business size standard is $4.5 million in average annual receipts. This contract will have a base period not to exceed one year with four, one-year option periods, an annual contract value of $1 million, and a total IDC value not to exceed $5 million. Work under this contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. An option period may be exercised when the contract amount for the base period or preceding option period has been exhausted. USDA APHIS currently has, and may award in the future, IDC contracts to perform work that may also be encompassed by this announcement. The selection board chair will consider the selection criteria below in deciding which contractor(s) will be selected. If more than one firm is selected, the top-ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second contract, and so on. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tie breaker between firms considered as technically equal. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined by the employees' office location (not the location of the work).<br /><br />2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Regional A/E will include Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, and Structural work for the preparation of contract drawings, specifications, cost estimates, and possible associated services such as: LEED design services, NEPA documentation and environmental assessments, designer of record services, commissioning, value engineering, design (peer) review, master planning, facility inspection for deficiencies, obtaining various required permits, construction management, geotechnical investigations, surveying, and performing Construction Inspection Contractor (CIC) services. CIC services may or may not be related to work designed by said firm if and when used. Projects will cover a variety of building types nationwide, such as offices, laboratory, animal and plant inspection stations, quarantine stations, and general utility buildings. Some work may involve only one or two disciplines, i.e., Mechanical/Electrical, where repair and/or remodeling are involved and other types of work might include incinerators, fumigation hoods, compressed gas facilities, water and sewer mains, and water treatment facilities. Some of our major facilities are located in Mission, TX; Ames, IA; Newburg, NY; Fort Collins, CO; Miami, FL; and Beltsville, MD. New buildings generally will be in the $100,000 to $5,000,000 cost range. Repair and remodeling work varies from a few thousand to $500,000 cost range. Location of the work will determine which regional contract will be used. The location of projects that are west of the Eastern borders of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico will be considered the Western Region. Work located east of the Western Region to the Eastern borders of Wisconsin, Illinois, Arkansas, and Louisiana will be considered the Central Region. Work located east of the Central Region to the Atlantic Ocean will be considered the Eastern Region. It is anticipated that at least one contract will be awarded to a firm or firms in each region. In the selection process, firms may be chosen for interviews prior to making the final selection.<br /><br />3.

<DESC>The description text used in the presolicitation synopsis for solicitation W56HZV-10-R-0288 that was posted on 29 April 2010 is replaced with the following text: Hippo Water Tankrack System.  NSN: 5430-01-487-7760.  QTY: 441 (5 year max).  Option: None.  FOB: Origin.  The offer due date will be on or about 2010 June 16 (see solicitation for actual offer due date).  See our webpage at contracting.tacom.army.mil/sol.htm for a copy of the solicitation, when it is posted, or email dami_amsta-idq@conus.army.mil.  This buy will result in a 5 year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract.  The acquisition is being sole sourced to Mil-Mar Century Corporation (MMC) through the Justification and Approval process under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements).  Obtaining the requirement from another source under a competitive acquisition process would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  MMC owns the proprietary technical data rights covering the systems already fielded.  Another company would need to provide a new product based on the current purchase description.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Description

This procurement is being solicited as unrestricted under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) subpart 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. Solicitation SP4701-10-R-0003 is designed to place a service contract for a fully competitive Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) product under a long term contract for service.  Offerors are encouraged to provide a proposal based on the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and the criterias set forth within this solicitation.  The contract will be for a one-year base period, with four one-year options. Acceptance of the four one-year option provision is mandatory and failure to accept the provision will result in an offer being eliminated from consideration. 

This prospective initiative will encompass a next-generation, web-based order management and print workflow solution. The delivery model that best fits DAPS needs is licensed software. Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) is the preferred products. This solution gives ownership and operation of the solution to the Government. Common industry terminologies used to describe similar systems are print e-business and web to print. The goal is to obtain information from vendors who can provide DAPS with innovative, cost-effective, reliable, state-of-the-art solutions and industry capabilities that would fulfill its requirements which are currently being satisfied by the existing solution called DAPS On-Line. DOL is a homegrown application developed using IT services offered through government contracts. A detailed functional, workflow and architectural description of DAPS Online solutions is explained later in this paragraph. DAPS Online is in the sustainment phase of its program life cycle. Due to the spiral development method used for DOL, the baseline code and tables are a decade old. Further enhancements or improvements to this application increase risk of reduced performance and system stability.  Therefore, the Government is seeking your knowledge to provide a more efficient and effective product methodology to use for the DOL system. 

We are seeking all solutions provided under this new technology refresh and will need to deliver the same functionality as the current DOL system with additional enhancements.    

In addition to AS-IS functionality, the solution delivered under this requirement must meet all the required functionality and respond to the desired functionality. The AS-IS, required requirements and desired requirements are explained as follows:   The Contractor shall deliver a system that can perform all the functionality such as:  Desired, is not mandatory but if provided as part of the COTS product should be highlighted in vendors proposal. Any functionality or features not described in DAPS requirement but provided as part of the COTS product(s) should be described. 

DAPS Online is the primary online tool for customers to access DAPS services. This tool was home-grown and has evolved over the past 11 years. Home-grown is used to describe a system that was developed using a Government contractor based on government requirements. Its origin as a client/server was migrated to a web application in 1988 as internet use became common place. The original tool intent was to provide a means by which customers anywhere can submit their print documents electronically to a DAPS facility anywhere. Additional functionality was added as usage increased and dependency on the system grew. The DAPS Online business model changed and expanded into new business areas. The simple job submission tool now offers new services to customers such as soft proofing while expanding in house utilization by offering workflow for the production plant, and it supplements our financial system with job level Management Information System reports and data.

DAPS Online is a web-based, e-commerce print solution consisting of a customer order, accounting, plant workflow and reports/management modules. The architecture is a single server comprised of the Operating System, web service application, and database and Java application.  Each regional DAPS Office (10 regional office) maintains their own DOL server. Therefore, the enterprise configuration includes 11 independent web servers located at the following DAPS  regional office sites: Pearl Harbor, HI; Jacksonville, FL; Norfolk, VA; Philadelphia, PA; Oklahoma City, OK; San Diego, CA; Great Lakes, IL; Pensacola, FL; Bangor, WA; and Wiesbaden, Germany. Each of these servers supports 3,000 to 4,000 customers within their geographical area. Each server supports 12-20 subordinate print plants that access the submitted orders through their PC internet browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) 6.0 and higher).  

The following web site provides details on each regional office and the facilities they manage: http://www.daps.dla.mil/Contact/RegionalOffices.aspx. 

DOL is built on Microsoft Windows 2000/2003 Advanced Server, Apache/Tomcat, MS (Structured Query Language) SQL and Java technology. The solution is a single server configuration; therefore the SQL database and web application reside on the same server. All the DOL servers reside on the DLA enterprise network (ETN), inside the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet).  Customers and DAPS Plant users access their DOL server from various network environments. DOL customers are from the .gov, .mil, and .com environments.
 
Each contract entered into under this prospective program will include maintenance requirements. We anticipate the use of Electronic Commerce. The contract will be evaluated for past performance individually and awarded on an all or none basis using  best value procedures.  Under Best Value Procedures, the Government will take into consideration terms and conditions when selecting a contractor, and will then perform a technical and price tradeoff evaluation to determine which offer represents the best value to the Government.  For this solicitation technical is significantly more important than price.

  A knowledge and ability to provide RF modeling of any potential reflectors surrounding the facility to show an expected performance level and the knowledge and ability to provide a complete RF coverage analysis for the proposed site and the airspace wherein it will be used. 
3   In depth knowledge of the FARS (Federal Aviation Regulations).
4    Familiar with Flight Check procedures, data and reports for VOR's,     Aeronautical Charting & Airways, Air Traffic requirements and procedures, SIAP's (Standard Instrument Approach Procedures), FAA Notices, Advisory Circulars, and AVN procedures and requirements regarding VOR's and TERPS (Terminal Procedures). En- route & terminal Air Traffic procedures
5    Demonstrate experience in preparing, writing, and verbally delivering Siting  Reports & Guidance reports to different entities within the FAA. ( Air Traffic, Operations, Flight Standards etc).

<DESC>THE DUE DATE FOR PROPOSALS IS MAY 27, 2010 BY 1PM EASTERN TIME

THE SOLICITATION HAS BEEN UPLOADED TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT 4/27/2010.  THIS IS NOT A DRAFT.

Questions related to the final solicitation shall be sent electronically to keith.austin@fda.hhs.gov no later then May 10, 2010 by 10 a.m. eastern time.  

Solicitation Number:

10-223-SOL-00082  Presolicitation

Notice Type:

Presolicitation

Synopsis:

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals under solicitation number 10-223-SOL-00082 (subject to change) for a program called the FDA Data Management Program (DMP).  The NAICS Code is 518210 with a small business size standard of $25 million.  

Project Background:

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of all FDA regulated products such as human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, food and dietary supplements, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. For each respective Center within FDA, legislation is set forth for voluntary and mandatory reporting of adverse events, product problems or complaints, and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) as cited in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act and other laws affecting the FDA. FDA receives these reports by electronic submission, mail, phone, fax, email, and via the internet. FDA requires support services for data entry and processing received reports. The key source of data entry includes Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs).1 These ICSRs are submitted to each Center in various formats. Currently, each Center has individual programs in place for supporting these legislative mandates and their respective missions. This contract shall provide the opportunity and means to align the individual Center programs with the Agency goal of a Unified Adverse Event Data Management Program, hereafter referred to as the Data Management Program (DMP). 

The FDA Centers missions and legislative authorization are presented below for FDA regulated products:

The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the FDA Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research (CBER) perform a crucial part of FDA's mission, pre-market and post-market safety and efficacy assessments of human drugs and biological products. The collection and analysis of reports by FDA staff must occur throughout the entire life cycle of the product in order to identify occurrences associated with the use of a drug or biologic in humans that could not have been predicted by such methods as clinical trials and bio-statistical analysis. These occurrences of adverse events or product problems must be reported to FDA in order for the Agency to carry out its mission protecting the U.S. public health.  CDER and CBER receive reports submitted by stakeholders such as manufacturers, importers, health care professionals, and consumers. In addition, FDA employees may obtain follow-up information and submit reports from the FDA field offices. 

For CDER and CBER the statutory provisions for FDAs requirement to record mandatory submission of adverse drug reports for an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or New Drug Application (NDA), Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA,) Biologic Licensing Application (BLA)and OTC products in an adverse event reporting system is Section 505(k))(1)2 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 CFR 310.305, 312.32, 314.80 and 600.80, Public Health Service Act, and Public law 109-462 

Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), is a standardized international terminology for coding of medical information for regulatory communication. MedDRA was developed by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH); it is used in electronic transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) following the ICH E2B standards. MedDRA enables medical accuracy and transparency in coding, and standardized communication of coded data between manufacturers/sponsors and regulators.

The FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) develops and implements national programs to protect the public health in the fields of medical devices and radiological health. These programs are intended to assure the safety, effectiveness, and proper labeling of medical devices. CDRH has the responsibility for post-market surveillance such as monitoring the performance, safety, and effectiveness of marketed medical devices. The objective of post-market surveillance is to protect the public from actual or potential hazards associated with medical devices.  CDRH receives device event reports submitted by stakeholders such as medical device manufacturers, importers, user facilities, health care professionals and consumers.

Section 519 of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act authorized CDRH to record mandatory submission of reports to protect the public from actual or potential hazards associated with medical devices. The MDR Regulation (21 CFR Part 803) establishes the requirements for the mandatory reporting of adverse events involving medical devices. The Medical Device Amendments to the FD&C were enacted on May 28, 1976.  The FD&C Act was amended again in 1997 by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA), which provide for streamlining the process of bringing safe and effective medical devices to the U.S. Market.

Enactment of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 (SMDA) and the 1992 Medical Device Amendment made a significant impact upon the mandatory aspects of CDRHs  post-market surveillance program.  In accordance with the MDR regulation 21 CFR Part 803.32 and 803.40, these revisions created an obligation for user facilities to report deaths and importers to report deaths and serious injuries directly to FDA and to the manufacturer.

The mission of the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) is to protect the public health by ensuring that the nations food supply is safe, sanitary, wholesome, and properly labeled, and that cosmetic products are safe and properly labeled.  CFSAN-regulated products include dairy products, plant foods, beverages, seafood, dietary supplements, cosmetic products, infant formula, medical foods, and color additives to food.  The CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) is a post marketing surveillance system to collect, analyze, monitor, and report adverse events and product complaints for CFSAN regulated products. Both mandatory and voluntary reporting of adverse events and product complaints are processed through CAERS.  In addition, specific legislation may require Centers to maintain stand-alone tracking systems such as infant formula and bioterrorism.  Mandatory reporting for dietary supplements is authorized under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&C) Act Section 761 and mandatory reporting for reportable food is authorized under FFD&C Section 417.  

The Reportable Food Registry (RFR or the Registry) is an electronic portal for Industry to report when there is reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. The RFR applies to all FDA-regulated categories of food and feed, except dietary supplements and infant formula (Section 417 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350f)).  Registered Food Facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food for human or animal consumption in the United States under section 415(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 350d) are required to report to FDA when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.  Federal, state, and local Government officials may also use the RFR portal to report information that may come to them about reportable foods.  
The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) regulates the manufacture and distribution of food additives and drugs that will be given to animals. These include animals from which human foods are derived, as well as food additives and drugs for pet (or companion) animals. CVM is responsible for regulating drugs, devices, and food additives given to, or used on, over one hundred million companion animals, plus millions of poultry, cattle, swine, and minor animal species. 
Post-marketing surveillance affords the primary means by which CVM obtains information regarding potential problems with the safety and efficacy of marketed approved new animal drugs as well as potential product and manufacturing problems. CVM receives reports submitted by stakeholders such as: manufacturers, importers, health care professionals, and consumers. This contract, at the present time, will only address post-marketing safety reporting. The scope may broaden to include premarketing in the future.

Section 512(l) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(l), and  514.80(b) of FDA regulations (21 CFR 514.80) requires applicants of approved animal drugs  to report adverse drug experiences and product and manufacturing defects.  Product and manufacturing defects must be reported if they meet the criteria in 21 CFR 514.80(b)(1).  Adverse drug events and product and manufacturing defects involving animals must be submitted based on the criteria in 21 CFR 514.80 (b)(2)(i) and (ii), and (4)(iv).  Voluntary reports are also accepted from consumers and veterinarians.

The Tobacco Control Act enacted by Congress and signed by the President in June 2009 created the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP).  As the mission of this Center is developed, reporting regulations will be defined and may require collection of adverse event reports related to products that the Center regulates.  This Center will be eligible to have a task order under this Agency-wide contract.

Over time, FDA intends to replace multiple current legacy processes and data systems that are used for the receipt, processing, validation, and assessment of received reports.  These transitions may require the adoption of new software, revised SOPs, and additional staff training under this contract.  Additionally, FDA intends to adopt emerging data exchange standards which may impact future electronic submission procedures.  FDA is in the early stages of transitioning to a single electronic internet portal for adverse event and product problem reporting for all products.  This portal will be known as the Safety Reporting Portal.  The Safety Reporting Portal will allow reports to be typed into a "rational questionnaire" internet application that tailors questions based on the type of report, product, event, etc.  As FDA transitions to new technologies, it is expected that tasks under this contract will be impacted.  These impacts will need to be assessed as they occur and modifications to task orders under this contract may need to be considered. 

Objectives:

The objectives of the Data Management Program (DMP) are to obtain the services of a single Contractor to provide qualified support for: 
1.	Processing reports commonly known as Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) such as triaging, registering (logging), tracking, imaging or scanning, data entry, data entry quality control, updating of data records (to include resolving duplicates and conflicting information), reviewing, editing, coding, coding quality control (QC), coding quality assurance (QA), filing and redacting, distributing, archiving, and shredding of physical media.

<DESC>This action has been awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of2009. In compliance with this Act, the Government posts this notice that Task Order 2.1.9was issued under contract NAS9-02078, the Bioastronautics Contract, to procure technicalexpertise for the Space Life Sciences Directorates contributions to NASAs CommercialCrew and Cargo Program Office (C3PO).  The technical expertise services provided underTask Order 2.1.9 are to provide updates to an initial set of Commercial Human SystemsIntegration Requirements, deliver a Commercial Medical Operations Requirements Documentfor application to commercial crew transportation services, and deliver a set ofhuman-centered design processes to provide guidance for commercial spacecraft designers. &lt;P&gt;Modification 184 to contract NAS9-02078 was issued to fund Task Order 2.1.9.  &lt;P&gt;Contract NAS9-02078 was awarded on a competitive basis.  The Task Order was issued usingthe same cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract arrangement that was established from theoriginal contract award. A cost-type arrangement is appropriate due to uncertaintiesinvolved in performance of this effort that do not permit costs to be estimated withsufficient accuracy for the use of a fixed-price contractual vehicle.  In addition, aCPAF contract was selected to provide the contractor the greatest incentive for efficientand economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. ThisBioastronautics Contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigatethe Government's risk. &lt;P&gt;In order to meet the requirements of the Recovery Act in the most prudent businessmanner, within the time constraints imposed, the existing Bioastronautics Contract is themost appropriate contractual vehicle for the work required.

<p>The incumbent, [REDACTED], is currently the only commercial provider of high band-width and/or satellite service into [REDACTED]is the only commercial communications company that already has in place all the equipment, facilities, and infrastructure needed to provide, operate and maintain the requested service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They have an operational Satellite Station with 11 meter antennas and currently provide service that supports not only DISA required service but is also supporting contracts for the [REDACTED]</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new vendor cannot provide the required service without duplicating all of the facilities (i.e., earth stations, radomes, RF equipment and personnel) that [REDACTED]already has in place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because completion of construction at [REDACTED]may take longer than two years, a lengthy lead-time is needed to allow other vendors an opportunity to compete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This long construction cycle is due to the adverse weather conditions at [REDACTED].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The construction season for exterior work at [REDACTED] is from 15 Jul to 15 September only.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The number of daylight hours per day fluctuates depending on the time of the year and can range from 0-24.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Approval of this bridge contract will allow for the lead-time needed for installation of the service by a new vendor.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, continued service with the existing contractor until a final DISN solution can be implemented would allow the warfighter to continue the missions without experiencing a disruption in service. Any disruption of service would have a negative impact on current operations and loss in continuity of operations. Without this continuity of the satellite lease, the operational service would require quickest (near simultaneous) transition to another satellite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The bridge contract also offers DISA a unique opportunity to leverage a known and operationally proven capability without our warfighters suffering loss of mission critical services as a result of waiting for the limited implementation window at [REDACTED]</p>
