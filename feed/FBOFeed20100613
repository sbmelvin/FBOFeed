<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): 3001, Inc, W91278-07-D-0088<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because it was not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. As such, a time-and-materials type action was awarded for non-commercial supplies and services (FAR 16.601(c)).<br><br>The requirement to provide necessary spares, upgrades, modifications, and new sensors to support survey operations is within the scope of the contract.  The Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX) requires equipment spares to support operation of its airborne sensor suite, to buy-down risk associated with equipment failure. The JALBTCX operates an airborne coastal mapping and charting system consisting of a bathymetric & topographic lidar, hyperspectral & photogrammetric imager 365 days per year world-wide to accomplish its coastal mapping and tactical nautical charting missions for the USACE and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office.  Support equipment to field office operations are subjected to constant wear and tear from packing and unpacking, shipping, and transport in field vehicles. Successful airborne sensor suite field operations and product delivery relies on a combination of good weather and water clarity, occasional operational constraints on solar angle and stage of the tide, and aircraft, sensor, and support equipment health.  These last three are the only ones that can be influenced by human intervention.  The aircraft travels with an engineer and a set of spares with which to make repairs so that aircraft health is rarely a constraint on operations.  This task order addresses a requirement for spares of the major field support equipment items, so that field operations can continue uninterrupted in the event of failure of the existing field suite equipment.
