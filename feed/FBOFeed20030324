A  RADHARD By Design, SOL BAA 03-22, DUE 051203, POC William Schneider, DARPA/MTO, FAX (703) 696-2206, email BAA03-22@darpa.mil

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals to develop and demonstrate design and layout techniques to support the fabrication of strategically radiation hardened silicon based (to include SiGe) ultra-deep submicron (e.g. less than or equal to 130 nm, 180 nm  for SOI technology) digital and analog / mixed signal integrated circuits . Specific interest is in the demonstration of design techniques for producing radiation hardened devices on standard commercial foundry flows, without any modification of the existing process or violation of design and layout rules, with corresponding electrical performance and area penalties of less than or equal to one generation. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice or that requires foundry flows not available from merchant foundries.  DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  
1.	Design hardened digital circuits and devices.
2.	Design hardened mixed signal circuits and devices
3.	Radiation testing of fabricated devices

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-22 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Awards totaling approximately $11 million over one year for phase 1 are expected to be made during the first half of calendar year 2003. Phase two and three efforts are anticipated, but are contingent upon year one success and should be proposed as options.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site  http://www.davincinetbook.com/RADHARD/ -has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is William Schneider, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: BAA03-22@darpa.mil. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled BAA 03-22, RADHARD By Design, Proposer Information Pamphlet which provides further information on areas of interest, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original, nine (9) hard copies and an electronic copy of the proposal (PDF (preferred)), or MS-Word readable on a CD-ROM, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette), and no more than four power point slides summarizing the critical aspects of the proposal must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-22) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Monday, May 12, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-22 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as Government Only.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in radiation hardened design. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 03-22.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals, which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.

The model will include a sealed transducer element, vibration eliminator, water-proof electrical connector, and 50 foot test cable.  Selection will be best value based on price (not to exceed $49,000), and technical approach (risk reduction in acoustic properties, shock resistance, and size.)   To be acceptable the complete model must meet the acoustic properties and the first-level (40 foot standoff) shock test.   The delivery requirement is six months.  NAICS: 334511 - 750 employees.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED ON AN "UNRESTRICTED" BASIS WITH POTENTIAL FOR PARTIAL SET-ASIDE INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  This procurement will result in the award of three to four separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) design-build Construction Contracts for general building type projects (new construction and renovations) including administrative, training, dormitory, community support, operational, maintenance, and supply type facilities, as well as boundary security projects including fencing, walls, gates, towers, and guard shelters for activities in the state of Florida (excluding west Florida and Key West) and Kings Bay, GA managed by Engineering Field Activity Southeast.  Of the three to four awardees two of the contracts will be potential set-asides for one 8(a) eligible and one HUBZone eligible contractor.  Contractors submitting a proposal under the 8(a) or HUBZone set-aside portion of this solicitation are required to be rated as at least acceptable in Phase I.  If the 8(a) and/or HUBZone contractors are not able to meet the requirements to make them acceptable in Phase I the set-aside portion of the procurement will be reverted to unrestricted and awarded as such.  The work will be at the following primary locations: Naval Air Station, Jacksonville; Naval Station, Mayport; Orlando and Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay, GA.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase, Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government  price and other factors considered.  Each contract will be for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $135 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million.  Projects will vary in size from approximately $3 million to $15 million.  The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders.  Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option to extend the contract.  Participation in pre-proposal conferences or site visits for future task orders will be the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders will require multi-disciplined design services including lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects will also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of this contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to 3 to 5 proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach; and Small Business subcontracting effort.  Phase I design-build factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building and boundary security type projects, not just the seed project identified at the end of this synopsis.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the successful 3 to 5 Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals for the "seed" project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals for the seed project will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the seed project; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Cost and Price proposals may include total cost; evaluation of scope/design options within the Government's published budget for award, and an evaluation of change order mark-ups and overhead.  The offeror with the best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded a project and an IDIQ design-build contract for the five (5) year term.  This initial seed project will satisfy consideration for minimum guarantees.  The follow on IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s).  A minimum guarantee of $25,000 will be consideration for the award of the second, third, and forth IDIQ contract(s).  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the offeror(s) are awarded no task orders over the five (5) year contract term.  Task orders will be competed among the IDIQ contractors with each task order awarded based on best value or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable proposal.  The seed project for this solicitation is:  (1)Design/Construction of an Aviation Support Equipment Maintenance Training Facility at Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL.  The Aviation Support Equipment Maintenance Training Facility project will construct a 1,856 SM (19,978 SF) two-story steel framed, masonry veneer with built-up roof applied instruction facility and a 737 SM (7,933 SF) one-story steel framed, masonry veneer with built-up roof high-bay aviation support equipment lab for the Naval Air Maintenance Group Detachment - Maintenance Training Units Aviation Support Equipment training.  Aviation support equipment lab will contain three (3) 4.6-meter (15 ft) high-bay areas, two (2) 11.6-meter (38 ft) high-bay areas, and three (3) 4.6-meter (15 ft) high-bay turbine test areas. The equipment lab (with particular emphasis on the turbine test bays) will have sound attenuation systems due to equipment-generated noise and vibration, parking and incidental related work.  Project also demolishes 1,011 SM (10,883 SF) one-story wood framed Building 702 constructed in 1940 and 173 SM (1,862 SF) one-story masonry block Building 1985.  Estimated value of the project is between $5.3M and $5.9M dollars.  The project budget cannot exceed $5.9M.  Phase I proposals will be due around 8 May 2003.  The exact date will be stipulated in the RFP.

The purpose of the newsletter is to facilitate the translation of cancer control research into practice and support the development of partnerships at the state and local level to help.  In September 2002, the NCI in partnership with the Center for the Advancement of Health sponsored a two-day conference titled "Designing for Dissemination" (D4D) that brought together researchers, practitioners and intermediaries to address issues of translating cancer control research into practice.  At the end of the two-day conference, groups presented short, medium and long-term goals for moving research into practice and made recommendations for continuing the dialogue among participants.  The D4D meetings represents only a fraction of the researchers, practitioners and intermediaries that are involved in the cancer control population.  Through exsting contacts and lists of the Center for Advancement of Health the electronic newsletter would reach an intended audience of more than 1500 people each month.  The creation of an e-newsletter would offer ongoing discussions, examples of key issues and list the availability of support for translation activities.  The Center for the Advancement of Health is the only source known to the government that can provide the  above services.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.

To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to meet the aforementioned requirements.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A fixed-price, purchase order is contemplated for this effort.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SUMMARY: The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking proposals from companies in the form of capability statements for Clinical Trials to provide  
1)	insulin,
2)      statin,
3)      ACE inhibitor,
4)	equipment needed for the care of children with type 2 diabetes (including glucose meters and strips, syringes, lancets, urine ketone strips, concentrated glucose solution for performing oral glucose tolerance tests, topical anesthetic cream for blood drawing, automated blood pressure devices and cuffs, automated scales),
5)	equipment required to measure the effects of lifestyle change (including mechanically breaked cycle ergometers, heart rate monitors and electronic metronomes for performing PWC, accelerometers, pedometers),
6)	materials to create a toolbox to be utilized to enhance the ability of underprivileged children to attain lifestyle changes, particularly increased physical activity (including sneakers, jump ropes, etc.)

STUDY GOAL: The overall goal of this study is to evaluate potential treatment modalities for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, to determine the safest and most efficacious options for treatment. Twelve clinical centers will enroll a total of approximately 750 patients. For medical care, subjects will be seen every 2 months during the first year, and every 3 months during the subsequent years. The total duration of the trial is 5 years. The primary outcome will be related to the achievement and maintenance of glycemic control; numerous important secondary outcomes will also be evaluated, including preservation of beta cell function, side effects and quality of life, markers for vascular complications, and cost effectiveness. 
	Applicants for a Clinical Trial Agreement to support this clinical trial must include a description of the staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies of patients with diabetes. Applicants should provide a detailed description of the materials or equipment to be provided. How the drug or product will be sent to each participating center, as well as packaging, storing and accountability issues must be presented. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS: A selection committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations. It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the selection committee through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria:
1.	The statement should provide specific details about the product to be supplied, particularly any validation of its use in a pediatric population, and in obese subjects, if relevant.
2.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the product in a timely manner for the duration of the study.
3.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator. 

DATES: Only written Clinical Trial capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before April 19, 2003 will be considered. Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited, at the Collaborators expense, to discuss their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Steering Committee, date and place to be determined. The Institute may issue an additional notice of Clinical Trial opportunity. This notice is directed toward companies with resources to support collaborations.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND QUESTIONS: Capability statements should be submitted to Rochelle Blaustein, J.D., Director, Technology Transfer and Development, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 12 South Drive, MSC 5632, Bethesda, MD  20892-5632, rochelleb@intra.niddk.nih.gov, Fax:  301-402-7461.

<DESC>Modication to correct Solicitation Number only: RFQ-NCI-30040-NQ.
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) plans to enter into a sole source contract with The Center for the Advancement of Health, 2000 Florida Avenue, N.W., Suite 210, Washington, D.C. 20009 to create an Electronic Newsletter.  The purpose of the newsletter is to facilitate the translation of cancer control research into practice and support the development of partnerships at the state and local level to help.  In September 2002, the NCI in partnership with the Center for the Advancement of Health sponsored a two-day conference titled "Designing for Dissemination" (D4D) that brought together researchers, practitioners and intermediaries to address issues of translating cancer control research into practice.  At the end of the two-day conference, groups presented short, medium and long-term goals for moving research into practice and made recommendations for continuing the dialogue among participants.  The D4D meetings represents only a fraction of the researchers, practitioners and intermediaries that are involved in the cancer control population.  Through exsting contacts and lists of the Center for Advancement of Health the electronic newsletter would reach an intended audience of more than 1500 people each month.  The creation of an e-newsletter would offer ongoing discussions, examples of key issues and list the availability of support for translation activities.  The Center for the Advancement of Health is the only source known to the government that can provide the  above services.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 P.M. EDT (Local Washington, D.C. time) on March 31, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determiniation by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code: 541990.

<DESC>RESPONSE DEADLINE EXTENSION:  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks collaborators for Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to implement a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter clinical trial of vitamin E versus an insulin-sensitizing agent versus placebo in patients with well characterized nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including  both children and adults.  A retrospective and prospective database of adult and pediatric cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease will also be created by the newly formulated NIDDK-funded NASH Clinical Research Network that will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of a large group of patients.  Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease also pose opportunities for CRADAs.             SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to provide insulin-sensitizing agents, Vitamin E and placebo to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial of therapy of  NASH.  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a CRADA to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and/or NASH. 

	Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to provide insulin sensitizing agent(s) such as biguanides or thiazolidinediones, Vitamin E and placebo to study important issues regarding possible treatment options and disease progression in NASH.  The potential Collaborator(s) capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies of NASH and should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed, proposed dosing regimes, possible strategies for assessing compliance, proposed methods for assessing levels of the vitamin E and/or insulin sensitizing agent (s), pharmacokinetics, and drug distribution methodology.  In addition, CRADA partners are being sought for ancillary studies.  Examples of potential studies include: 

1)	The identification of host genetic factors associated with the development of NASH and with the risk of fibrosis progression. This will involve the analysis of genomic DNA from individuals with NASH as well as NAFLD for functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in prioritized candidate genes, which have been identified using a combination of literature search and informatic algorithms including biologic mechanisms, pathogenesis, linkage analysis and biochemical studies.

2)	Exploration of serum markers for fibrosis to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical and laboratory variables.  Also, the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in treatment trials.

3)	Evaluation of the role of lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and analysis of the effect of various therapies on the levels of serum and urine peroxides in patients with NAFLD participating in treatment trials.

4)	Develop gene expression arrays that are diagnostic of fatty liver disease and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, steatosis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.

5)	Use of cytokine assays for analyses of serum/plasma cytokine levels as markers of necro-inflammatory or fibrotic activity in NASH and as surrogate markers of histologic improvement in therapeutic trials of NASH.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. It is not a grant, and is not a contract for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and may contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.

	Study Goal:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with NASH using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of NASH and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a database on adult and pediatric patients with NASH and NAFLD including clinical information as well as serum and tissue samples.  In addition, the NASH Clinical Research Network will conduct a prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of promising therapies for NASH, including use of an insulin-sensitizing agent (such as a biguanide or thiazolidinedione) and/or an anti-oxidant (such as vitamin E) compared to placebo.    
Applicants for a CRADA to support this clinical trial must include a description of investigators and staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies to assess patients with NAFLD and NASH.  Applicants should provide a detailed description of the pharmacokinetics of the proposed drugs to be used including how and when the drugs should be taken.  The process for biologic sample collection, storage and handling needs must be included.  A description of the laboratory tests that are needed including assays to determine specific drug levels along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.

<DESC>The issuance of this solicitation is extended to 31 March 2003.

DSCC is soliciting for an Automotive Prime Vendor (Worldwide.)  These parts will be used by the U.S. Armed Forces.  

Our goal will be to provide worldwide logistics support for automotive-type items.  A Prime Vendor (PV) will be awarded the contract to provide 1) DLA non-stocked NSNs, 2) price listed and 3) non-price listed CAGE and P/N items.  There will also be an unpriced feature, that allows for ordering items by CAGE and P/N (when not already priced).  

The PV will assume total supply chain management, which includes:  inventory management, distribution, parts acquisition and material forecasting.    The PV must possess the ability to source miscellaneous vehicular engine and power transmission equipment and to provide delivery based on requisition priority.  The PV will be required to interface directly with the military customer to provide both support of parts and method of support as the customers environment changes.  

The PV will be required to receive and transmit by Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).  The Government will transmit orders by EDI using conventions and formats prescribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12 and the Department of Defense (DoD) Implementation Guidelines for the transfer of acquisition data and invoicing.  

The anticipated initial contract period will be for two years beginning on the date of award, with eight option years for a total of ten years.  

Access to the NSNs and P/Ns included on this solicitation can be downloaded from http://dibbs.dscc.dla.mil/Rfp/ on the date of issue.

<SUBJECT>D -- National Provider Identifier/National Plan ID (NPI/NPlanID) Enumerator

<CONTACT>Darrell Bachman, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-7442, Fax 410-786-9643, Email DBachman@cms.hhs.gov - Leisa Bodway, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-786-1278, Fax 410-786-9643, Email LBodway@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking to identify qualified firms for a contract to be issued no later than September 30, 2003, for the administration and assignment of National Provider Identifiers (NPI) to health care providers and plans by utilization of the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES).   The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) Code applicable to this proposed action is 514210.  The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-191) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adopt a national standard identifier for health care providers for use in the health care industry and adopt a standard unique national identifier for health plans for use by health plans, health care clearinghouses, and covered health care providers.  The NPPES is the computer system that will be used to uniquely identify health care providers and plans, assign them NPIs/NPlanIDs, update their information, and disseminate data to the industry.   

The Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) that would establish the NPI as the standard, unique provider identifier was published in the Federal Register on May 7, 1998.  The preamble of the NPRM included discussions on how providers would get NPIs, what system would generate the NPIs, what information was needed to assign NPIs, what information would be disseminated from the system and to whom.  It also included requirements needed by health plans, health care providers, and health care clearinghouses regarding the NPI, what impact the NPI would have on those entities, what uses could be made of the NPI, and the cost of building and maintaining the enumeration system, enumerating providers and keeping their data current.  The NPRM stated that NPIs would be issued by one or more organizations known as Enumerators.  It is anticipated that CMS will determine that one Enumerator is the most efficient and effective approach. 

This NPPES system has already been created by AMS and will be provided by CMS to the firm that will be awarded the contract for this work.  AMS will be responsible for maintenance on the system until the NPI/NPlanID contractor is fully implemented.  The Enumerator would carry out a number of functions, including, but not limited to, entering identifying information about a health care provider into the NPPES; notifying a health care provider that applies via paper application of its NPI; and assisting providers with questions or problems, including those providers applying for NPIs via the internet.  The NPPES will edit the data, check for consistency, formatting addresses, and validating Social Security Numbers.  The NPPES will also search the database to determine whether the health care provider already has an NPI.  

Specific requirements of the proposed contract effort considered necessary for successful performance are:  

1.	The first phase of the contract would involve the following activities, taking place between contract award and July 30, 2004: (1) Staffing  acquiring the necessary staff to accomplish the contract requirements; (2) Equipment  acquiring the necessary equipment (e.g., telephones, PCs, T1 lines) to accomplish contract requirements; (3) Space  acquiring building accommodations necessary to house staff and equipment; (4) Training  establishing desk procedures and training staff in the use of those procedures; facilitating the training of staff on the NPPES, including setting up a training facility for initial training and training of new staff on an ongoing basis (the NPPES training will be furnished by CMS staff and/or another contractor in April, 2004each user will receive a Users Manual); (5) Unique Physician Identification Number (UPIN)  load  CMS will load UPIN data from the registry into the NPPES in May, 2004, in an attempt to accomplish a bulk enumeration of the physicians enrolled in the Medicare program.  The Enumerator shall be responsible for printing and mailing notification letters to physicians, and handling inquiries from physicians or physician staff.  The number of physicians enumerated in this manner is expected to be approximately 600,000; (6) Enumeration of new provider applicants The number of applicants for the initial period of July 1, 2004-July 30, 2004 is expected to be approximately 200,000.  CMS estimates approximately 100,000 applications to occur via paper applications, and 100,000 via the web.  (7) Updates of provider data  CMS anticipates little activity for the 1-month period when providers will be able to make changes to their data and (8) Handling of provider inquiries.  CMS anticipates a heavy volume of inquiries at the start of the project, with most involving requests for application forms.  
2.	The second phase of the contract would involve ongoing enumeration of health care providers, taking place between August 1, 2004 and February 28, 2005.  The number of applicants for this period is expected to be approximately 1,000,000.  CMS estimates approximately 460,000 applications to occur via paper applications, and 540,000 via the web.

<SUBJECT>75--BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR PURCHASE OF OFFICE PRODUCTS
<SOLNBR>DABK01-03-R-0000
<RESPDATE>042503
<ARCHDATE>06242003
<CONTACT>Janie Wright, 404-464-4104
<DESC>NA On 1 October 2002, the Army mandated the use of a group of blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) for the purchase of office products.  The primary goals of the BPA initiative are to ensure that office product purchases are in compliance with the statutory pre ferences afforded to products manufactured under the Javits-Wagner-ODay (JWOD) Act and to capture economies of scale.   A total of twelve vendors received BPAs.  The BPAs were tied to current federal supply schedules issued by the General Services Administration (GSA) and each vendor is an authorized JWOD distributor for office products.  All CONUS Army users are now requir ed to purchase office products through the BPAs.  However, Army installations with an onsite self-service supply store must use the store as their first option to obtain JWOD office products.  To the maximum extent practicable, BPA purchases must be made t hrough the DoD E-Mall at https://emall.prod.dodonline.net/scripts/emLogon.asp.   Army customers place orders using the Government-wide Purchase Card. The Army is now considering the issuance of additional BPAs and is also addressing problems and questions identified during the first several months of BPA use.  Therefore, to assist with further planning strategies, the Army is seeking input from current BPA holders as well as additional vendors who are interested in future business opportunities regarding office products.   Specific issues of concern include: 1.  Use of E-MALL.   The Armys goal is to track individual purchases made by purchase card holders down to the product level and to track statistics for all socio-economic business categories we are mandated to report such as Small Business, HUB Zone, Sma ll Disadvantaged Business, Veteran Owned Business, Woman Owned Business, Native American and other socio-economic categories.  This will enable us to analyze spending patterns and to measure our performance against these socio-economic criteria.  Ancillary  goals are to limit the number of hours Army cardholders spend with sales staff, and limit access to Army bases for security considerations.   Therefore we intend to mandate that, to the maximum extent practicable, all orders be placed through the BPAs on the E-MALL, and to severely limit or restrict any orders placed directly with BPA holders, either through sales staff, telephonic, or direct web site.    2.  Delivery.  The current BPAs require delivery within 24 hours of order placement.  Please provide your assessment as to whether a requirement for 24-hour delivery is unreasonable and whether the Army could save money by using a 3-4 day basic delivery re quirement.  What is the industry standard?  Would a delivery plan that includes additional fees for expedited delivery be more economical than a standard 24-hour delivery requirement?  Should zip codes or other geographic mechanisms be a consideration in d elivery requirements?  If so, please recommend a method you feel would be most effective,  3.  Minimum Orders.  Is a minimum order amount a significant concern for vendors?  If so, what is an appropriate dollar amount? 4.  Charges to Customer Purchase Card.  Due to administrative procedures surrounding the Government-wide Purchase Card, separate charges resulting from split deliveries cause additional work for cardholders.  The Armys objective in the new round of BPAs i s to reduce tracking, administrative burden, and paperwork for purchase card holders who use the BPAs.   Split orders with split charges to the card, for example, could result in order dollar values below some minimum, and potentially result in order rej ection or duplicate shipping charges.  The Army plans to include a provision to require that only complete orders be shipped OR that a single charge be applied to the credit card for the entire shipment, regardless of whether origin is single or multiple p oint, and even if time-phased shipments are made against a single order.  From an industry perspective, what are the pros and cons of this proposal?   Please make recommendations as to the most effective method(s) to achieve this objective? 5.  Pricing and Discounts.  The Armys objective is to achieve the maximum possible discount from BPA vendors for total dollar volume ordered.  This, we believe, can be achieved via initial discounts from GSA Schedule pricing, and a schedule of additional discounts that will become effective as the total dollar volume ordered under an individual BPA reaches certain thresholds.  These discounts would then be applied to the pricing in the E-MALL catalog.  Volume discounts would remain in effect for the life o f the BPA and potentially for follow on BPAs.   Pricing is a significant customer concern and the Army intends to assure that BPA prices are competitive with best open market prices or special contract terms and conditions offered to customers with similar  buying volume.  It is critical that the Army provide customers with the best quality, delivery and pricing available.  What advice can industry provide to effectively structure a discount system that will work effectively to achieve the Armys goals?  Wha t is the best way to apply quantity discounts for combined Army purchasing power?   What are the specific risks from an industry perspective that would arise as a result of this approach, and specifically, of any alternative solution industry proposes?  Pl ease include specifics as to the structure and mechanism proposed. 6.  Prepriced Items.  The Army is considering the potential benefits of pre-pricing some of the most popular office products.  If we elect to do this, we may mandate that only vendors who are very competitive in their pricing of these products (one or more ) will receive BPAs that cover these pre-priced items.  What challenges would industry foresee in administering such a program?  What issues should be considered and addressed before such a decision is made? 7.  Javits-Wagner ODay Act Compliance.   It is the unambiguous purpose of the Army to assure that orders placed under these comply with JWOD Act.  What challenges do vendors face regarding JWOD issues?   Can vendors readily identify and differentiate betw een mandatory JWOD products and JWOD-produced products in the E-MALL catalog?  Are there pricing or delivery issues with JWOD products that should be raised to the JWOD committee?   8.  Potential Awards To Teams Or Business Consortia.   It is the Armys intent to encourage small business teams or consortia to submit proposals as single entities.  The goal is to assure uniformity of pricing, reduced administration for the Army, a broad er business base, and improved service for Army customers.  We have initially identified potential issues with this approach, such as assuring that small business offerors work with the Small Business Administration to assure that their teaming arrangement  does not exclude them from proposing as a small business entity.  Also, the Army would not be amendable to managing separate catalogs, shipping terms, etc. for individual members of the consortia or teams.  These details would have to be worked directly b etween the BPA holder entity (team or consortium) and the E-MALL technical staff.   Please submit written responses to this Request for Information to Ms. Lynn Worsham at the Army Contracting Agency, Southern Region Headquarters, or e-mail Lynn.Worsham@forscom.army.mil.   Please indicate interest in future business opportunities for offic e supply products.  Include business name and address, business size (NAICS code is 422120 and the small business size standard is 500 employees), and contact information.   Responses are due by 25 April 2003.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service-Arkansas State Office intends to conduct a cost comparison in accordance with OMB-approved USDA Express Review Study procedures. The study is  for mailroom support functions in Little Rock, Arkansas, NAICS Code 561210. Major mailroom support tasks include general mailroom operations (receiving, sorting, distributing, collecting, and sending mail), office reproduction services, vehicle maintenance services, central supply room operations, and pickup and delivery services. The USDA Express Review  process is based on the assumption that the commercial activity under study is regularly performed under contract by commercial activities at firm fixed prices and that existing Federal contracts can be used, with only minor modification, to level and define the scope of the competition and avoid the need to develop a new PWS or a formal solicitation. NRCS is seeking to locate commercial businesses that have experience and also have current government contracts for  mailroom support services. All interested and capable parties that have expertise in mailroom support services should respond VIA E-MAIL to the Contracting Officer soila.reando@ar.usda.gov or terry.franks@ar.usda.gov with a list of their 1) contract number 2) Federal Agency  name and point of contact 3) the firm fixed price of each contract 4) the period of performance covered and 5) the size and business status. NOTE: This is NOT a SOLICITATION or request for proposal; however, depending on the results of the streamlined cost comparison, a solicitation may be issued at a later date.  Any questions should be submitted via EMAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Soila Reando or Ms. Terry Franks.

Title:  	Selective Electroless Attachment Of Contacts To Electrochemically-active Molecules

Description:  	This technology provides a solution-based method for attaching metal contacts to molecular films.  The metal contacts are attached to functional groups on individual molecules in the molecular film.  The chemical state of the functional group is controlled to induce electroless metal deposition preferentially at the functional group site.  The functionalized molecules may also be patterned on a surface to give spatial control over the location of the metal contacts in a more complex structure.  Spatial control is limited only by the ability to pattern the molecular film.  To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, self-assembled monolayers of model, molecular-electronic compounds have been prepared on gold surfaces, and these surfaces were subsequently exposed to electroless deposition plating baths.  These samples exhibited selective metal contact attachments, even on patterned surfaces.
