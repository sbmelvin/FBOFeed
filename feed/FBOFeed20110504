<DESC>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue, on a sole source basis, a solicitation procure the "Pilot Evaluation of the Chronic Disease Self Management Program" (CDSMP) to the National Council on Aging (NCOA) using Medicare administrative data.

<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The NCOA is currently conducting a survey based evaluation of the CDSMP using a proprietary sample of program participants. It is CMS's intent to provide additional funding to NCOA to both build a linkage between this propriety sample of participants and Medicare Administrative Claims data and to conduct an analysis of these data to determine the CDSMP's impact on administrative measures of beneficiary health outcomes, healthcare utilization, and costs. Further, the linking of these data sources will allow the NCOA to uniquely adjust for both survey and claims based measures of potential confounders in analyzing CDSMP's impact on Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The anticipated award date of the contract is expected to be by June 1, 2011.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The Government will not evaluate proposals or accept telephone calls in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of AIDS has a requirement for a comprehensive quality assessment program for virologic assays for HIV, and HIV-related viral co-pathogens. The program must ensure the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from NIAID-supported clinical trials.<br /><br />The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking a contractor to provide a comprehensive quality assessment program for virologic assays for HIV, and HIV-related viral co-pathogens. The program must ensure the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from NIAID-supported clinical trials by providing laboratories with validation and proficiency testing panels and real time assay run controls, and analyzing proficiency panel and assay run data from each laboratory. The contractor must also plan and execute single and multi-laboratory studies for the evaluation and development of new and existing virologic assays and supporting statistical methodologies, implement standards of performance for existing and state-of-the-art new virologic assays, develop and test biostatistical methods relating to the assays, and acquire, test, store and dispense all quality control materials and reagents required for this program, including specimens collected from HIV-infected and -uninfected human subjects. The contractor will serve laboratories associated with current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups. Currently, the contract serves approximately 110 laboratories, 55 of which are international, located in 22 countries.<br /><br />It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded for a one year base period of performance beginning on or about June 1, 2012. Options will be included to extend the term of the contract for an additional six years for a maximum period of performance of 7 years. The level of effort anticipated for support of the base period and six-one year options is 9.10 FTE/year.<br /><br />In addition, the Government may exercise options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of this contract. Options for increased services may include:<br /><br />Increased Level of Effort for Additional Labs: During the course of the contract it may be necessary to incorporate additional Labs to support new NIAID-supported clinical trials. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an option. Each option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of 5 Labs. More than one (1), but not more than three (3), Options may be exercised in any one year. It is estimated that an additional 0.20 full time equivalents (FTEs) will be needed to accommodate these additional Labs during the first year of activation. If the options for these Labs are exercised for continuation in subsequent years, 0.10 FTE/year will be needed. Options to add new Labs will not be exercised in the last year of the contract (Year 7).<br /><br />Addition of Expertise: Addition of a Quality Assessment Program for viral disease agents other than HIV and related co-pathogens. During the course of the contract it may be necessary to develop a quality assessment program for assays associated with viral disease agents other than HIV that were not anticipated at the time this solicitation was initiated, and that would directly support high priority NIAID research programs. During the contract period, one option could be activated for the addition of a Quality Assessment Program. The option may be activated in any year of the contract. Additional options to extend the Quality Assessment Program for subsequent years may be exercised as well. It is estimated that 3.10 full time equivalents (FTEs) will be needed for this Option in the first year, and in subsequent years if options are exercised for continuation.<br /><br />Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on May 18, 2011 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/). This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<CONTACT>Morie Gunter-Henderson, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone 301-492-3646, Fax 301-492-3437, Email Morie.GunterHenderson@nrc.gov
<DESC>Appendix A, "General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants," to 10 CFR Part 50, General Design Criterion (GDC) 2, "Design Bases for Protection Against Natural Phenomena," requires, in part, that nuclear power plant structures, systems, and components (SSCs) important to safety must be designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomena (such as earthquakes) without loss of capability to perform their safety functions. This includes not only the effects of shaking, but also possible shear or volumetric deformations in the underlying geologic foundation materials. Regulatory Guide 1.198, "Procedures and Criteria for Assessing Seismic Soil Liquefaction at Nuclear Power Plant Sites," provides guidance on seismic assessments, but currently provides minimal guidance on how to conduct deformation assessments. <br /><br />Traditionally, site performance has been assessed using the assumption (either implied or explicitly) of one-dimensional (1D) propagation of waves, at both an element level and a site-scale level. These 1D analyses often include assessments of both seismic shaking and of seismic deformations. However, over the past decade or more, there has been a significant increase in the awareness that this may not always be appropriate (and is possibly un-conservative) in some cases. <br /><br />On an element level, there is a fundamental understanding that soils are sheared in three dimensions during earthquakes, although very limited research has been performed to assess the related multi-dimensional effects. This is true in part because specialized equipment (i.e. multi-directional simple shear) is required and the large majority of testing is performed using the more common 1D or 2D equipment. There are currently very limited datasets of bi&not;directional simple shear laboratory testing to elucidate the effects of multi-dimensional loading. However, the limited research that has been performed on dense sands to date indicates that current modeling tools, which are based on early unidirectional testing, will under-predict deformations in sandy materials in some cases. Understanding the true potential deformations in dense sandy materials under multi-directional loading is essential for undertaking reliable performance-based assessments of nuclear installations. Dense sands and sand mixtures are the most common soil types found at proposed non-rock nuclear sites. Because some multi-dimensional element level simple shear laboratory testing results have served to highlight the critical importance of developing a better understanding of multi&not;dimensional loading in deformation-focused performance-based engineering, the NRC is initiating a coordinated research effort to address several inter-related issues related to multidirectional loading of nuclear sites. This request for proposal is part of that effort. Using tools, such as high-end soil-structure-interaction methods, the impact of 2D and 3D seismic loading on a nuclear power plant and its site, including the effects of soil deformation on the structural foundation and piping, can be analyzed. However, undertaking these analyses requires 3D material constitutive models. Unfortunately, as a result of the general lack of multidirectional laboratory data available, there has been limited development and validation of soil constitutive models focused on 3D loading. This project addresses this need by undertaking both the testing and modeling tasks needed to further develop existing constitutive dense sand models. <br /><br />The NRC is currently also undertaking a separate program to develop a new open-source Soil&not;Structure-Interaction (SSI) modeling tool based on the OpenSEES platform for the purpose of undertaking collaborative and in-house research on performance-based design of nuclear power plants (NPPs). New multi-dimensional dense sand models are needed for this upcoming SSI research. Models developed in the project described here must be compatible with this OpenSEES-based platform. <br /><br />In addition, there is now an understanding that the element-level behavior of sands under multi&not;directional loading (in terms of modulus degradation and damping curves) is sometimes very different than under 1D loading and is a function of ground motion rotation in addition to loading. Currently the NRC has a separate cooperative program with the Bureau of Reclamation underway to develop new multi-dimensional site response tools focused on the impacts of multi&not;directional loading on shaking. Efforts will be made by NRC staff to bring synergy between these projects to the degree possible. <br /><br />The objective of this contract is to investigate an area of seismic performance in which recent work has shown that current tools and methods may be un-conservative. This work will improve understanding of the behavior of dense sands and sandy material under multi-dimensional loading through appropriate laboratory investigations. This work will then develop one or more multi-dimensional dense sand constitutive models to be used in more accurate soil-structure &not;interaction of potential seismic deformations in soils at nuclear power plants sites that are subjected to seismic loading. <br /><br />The results of this work will develop part of the technical basis for an update of Regulatory Guide 1.198, "Procedures and Criteria for Assessing Seismic Soil Liquefaction at Nuclear Power Plant Sites" Currently the guide notes that deformation assessments must be undertaken, but provides little guidance as to how that is done. <br /><br />It is anticipated that this requirement will result in one (1) contract award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. <br /><br />The period of performance of the resultant contract will be forty eight (48) months from date of award. <br /><br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about November 22, 2010, and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website.

Vendors can obtain more information on the Interested Vendors List (IVL) by clicking on the following link to our Vendor's Guide:<br /><br />http://www.fbo.gov/EPSVendorsManual/VG6-Interest.html<br /><br />Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. <br />The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. <br /><br />The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $6.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541690.<br /><br />Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Notice to large businesses: The subcontracting plan requirements of P.L. 95-507 are applicable to this effort.

<DESC><p>The Regional Mission for Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus (hereinafter referred to as USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the four-year Rule of Law Institutional Strengthening Program to strengthen the institutional capacity, transparency and accountability of key justice sector institutions in order to guarantee the independence and increase the effectiveness and professionalism of the judiciary. The Rule of Law Institutional Strengthening Program will lead to (1) a more effective, transparent and accountable Moldovan judiciary through a strengthened capacity of the Superior Council of Magistrates (SCM) and the Department of Judicial Administration (DJA); (2) improved professional judicial and prosecutorial cadre through an enhanced institutional and operational capacity of the National Institute of Justice; and (3) improved public legal awareness and increased capacity of civil society organizations to monitor and advocate for justice sector reform.</p>
<p>Component one of the program will support the development of the SCM's capacity to effectively oversee the work of the courts and become the main policy-making authority for the judiciary. The activities under this component will introduce modern principles and practices of court administration, will complete the transition from paper to a fully automated judicial system, and assist with the development of performance based monitoring and budgeting of the judiciary. This effort will bring together improved systems, modern technology, and competent human resources.</p>
<p>Component two will improve the capacity of the NIJ to deliver high quality training to judges and other members of the judiciary such as court clerks, secretaries, and court administrators. The program will support the NIJ in identifying the areas of greatest need for training the judicial cadre, and support the NIJ with curriculum development and course organization.</p>
<p>Activities under component three will support the development of existing legal advocacy groups in assuming a more proactive role in monitoring and advocating for justice sector reform. Activities will also focus on the average citizen and his rights, as well as the tools available to better protect these rights and to hold the judiciary accountable to the law.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:steve.hepner@us.army.mil">TACOM Contracting Center (TACOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>Market Survey - Similar Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) Capabilities<br><br>Background, JLTV Program. The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) Program is a Family of Vehicles (FoV) leveraging technologies developed in the commercial sector and within the Department of Defense (DoD) to meet existing and emerging military capabilities. The JLTV FoV is a new start materiel solution intended to fill these capability gaps. JLTV has been approved at Milestone A and is currently reaching the end of the Technology Development Phase. It is anticipated that the JLTV Program will be designated by the Milestone Decision Authority as an ACAT-1D, Major Defense Acquisition Program.<br><br>Current DRAFT JLTV Program Description. The JLTV program is developing two mission role variants (MRVs) to regain transportability and restore a balance between protection, payload, and performance. The MRVs - a four (4) passenger Combat Tactical Vehicle (CTV) and a two (2) passenger Combat Support Vehicle (CSV) - will enhance light tactical mobility for combat, combat support, combat service support forces by providing Protection, through Scalable armor to provide mission flexibility while protecting the force; Sustainment, through reliable, maintainable, component commonality, onboard and exportable power, and reduced fuel consumption; Networking, through connectivity for improved Battlespace Awareness (BA) and responsive, well-integrated Command and Control (C2) for embarked forces; Transportability, through transport capable by a range of lift assets, including air, rail, and sea modes; and Mobility through chassis, suspension and drive train innovations.  In addition, the JLTV support tactical mobility for ground combat forces, small unit task execution for combat, combat support and combat service support missions during land, access and access denial, littoral, irregular, stability, Airborne, and Air Assault operations.  This capability provides protected, sustained, networked tactical mobility for small ground combat units (and crew-served weapons) in the performance of combat patrols, raids, conventional assaults, long-range reconnaissance, convoy escorts and other combat related tasks.  It also supports direct fire support weapons such as anti-tank and heavy automatic weapons.<br><br>The latest emerging draft requirements for the JLTV program are located on this website:<br>http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/majorsys/jltv_emd/jltv_emd.htm<br><br>JLTV Market Research Information Requested. The JLTV Program Office seeks to obtain vehicle system information and other supporting information from Industry in an effort to identify and conduct analysis on vehicles with capabilities similar to the JLTV.  The analysis will aim to compare capabilities, measures of effectiveness, cost, schedule, concepts of operations, and overall risk.  The JLTV Program Office is aware of a number of programs currently in development that are making strides in protection, mobility, and weight. The intent of this Market Survey is to receive the most recent, fact-based information related to programs that may be considered similar to, or potential candidates for, a JLTV family of vehicles.   This information will assist the JLTV Program Office in developing its acquisition and procurement strategy for the JLTV Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase.<br><br>To allow JLTV to make an informed assessment of current industry capabilities, information is needed in the following categories outlined below. The reference attachments should be completed to the best extent possible. This should not preclude providing additional information thought to add benefit that would allow the JLTV Program Office better understand what industry is currently able to provide. Any additional information provided in response to this Market Survey will also be taken into consideration.<br><br>Cost Analysis Information. (Reference Attachment A) Responses are requested in four cost related areas to allow the market research team to make informed evaluations of achievable cost ranges for a full vehicle system. This information will be used to estimate realistic base vehicle and sustainment cost targets.<br><br>Mobility Analysis Data. (Reference Attachment B) Responses are requested to describe the data which is required to build an NRMM (NATO Reference Mobility Model) model for the purposes of estimating on-road and off-road mobility performance and making comparisons to the current JLTV requirements. Any additional information (ie. general description, vehicle overview, pictures, test or simulation results) related to achievable performance will also be considered.<br><br>Protection Data. Unclassified responses are requested to describe the key features of the cab and vehicle design. Responses should address, but not be limited to, material selection (use of metallic, ceramics, composites), crew injury assessments, weight class, design maturity, and whether the survivability information being provided is for a hull or full vehicle system design. Unclassified information that describes the manufacturing processes or techniques for providing protection will allow the market research team to evaluate the state-of-the-art from industry. DO NOT SUBMIT ANY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.  CLASSIFIED information should not be provided as part of the response to this Market Survey, but may be requested at a later date.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: Any information submitted in response to this Market Survey is for planning purposes and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisition.  The Government in no way intends to award a contract on the basis of this Market Survey or otherwise pay for the information requested.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement only and is not intent to procure.  A solicitation is not available at this time and any requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The White Sands Contracting office is conducting market research to determine the capability of small businesses in regards to GL Studio and C++ Code Generator software course at Disti Corporation, 11486 Corporate Blvd, Suite 19, Orlando, Florida 32817.<br><br>The GL Studio comes standard with either the C++ or Java code generator. Additional code generators can be added to the editor as needed. The geometry contained within a GL Studio design can be reused across all instances of code generation.<br><br>GL Studio implements a user's design by generating human readable source code from the editor. This code is created by the touch of a button in either C++, Java, or Embedded C++ (EC++). This raw human readable source code gives the user an unprecedented level of usability since it can easily be integrated into any design environment. GL Studio was the first object-oriented graphical interface design tool on the market to include a C++ code generator to implement a user's design. <br><br>This is ANSI Standard C++ code that is understandable to any object-oriented programmer regardless of their level of expertise. Complex graphical interface designs, which typically require numerous hours when written by hand, are completed in just minutes when using the GL Studio approach. This code generator is part of the safety critical solution available with GL Studio.<br><br> The Safety Critical Embedded C++ code generator works in conjunction with the Safety Critical embedded runtime library to produce displays that are suitable for use in Safety Critical applications. Users developing display content for this area can utilize this solution through the entire lifecycle of a product starting from the prototyping phase. See the safety critical section of this catalog for more details. <br><br>Each potential source is also requested to provide the contract number(s), dollar value(s) and brief description of work previously or currently being performed, which specifically demonstrates the contractor's ability to successfully satisfy the requirements of the Target Control Software. <br><br>All responses to this sources sought are limited to twelve pages and must include the following additional information: name and address of firm, commercial activity/government entity (CAGE) code, small business size status, point of contact name, title, phone, and email.  Interested sources shall submit all replies by email to dennis.g.donaldson@us.army.mil no later than 1400 PST on 09 May 2011.  Acknowledgement of receipt will not be made.<br><br>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your responses to this sources sought will be treated as information only.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this sources sought.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><strong><br /><br />Background:<br /></strong>Head Start is a nationwide comprehensive child development program serving eligible children from birth to five and their families. Head Start is child focused and has the overall goal of helping children from low-income families become ready to succeed in school. Administered by the Office of Head Start in the Administration of Children and Families (ACF), funds are provided through grants to local public agencies, private organizations and Indian tribes. These organizations provide services in early childhood development and education, health, dental health, mental health, nutrition and parent involvement.<br /><strong><br /><br />Project Synopsis:<br /></strong>The Office of Head Start (OHS) provides budgetary, programmatic and policy guidance to Head Start (HS) and Early Head Start (EHS) operating grantees nationally and directly administers approximately 217 Head Start operating grants to American Indian/Native Alaskan and Migrant/Seasonal program grantees, and approximately 404 research and other discretionary grants. A portion of the latter has been transferred to the Office of Program Research and Evaluation (OPRE) although these grants are funded annually out of the OHS's appropriation. <br /><br />The Office of Grants Management's Division of Discretionary Grants (OGM/DDG) located within the Office of Administration, and part of ACF, provides management and technical administration of discretionary grants for several Federal grant programs. Two teams within OGM/DDG currently provide management and technical administration of discretionary grants for the OHS. OGM/DDG assures that all discretionary grant awards comply with applicable Federal statutes, regulation, policies and directives and that resultant awards are administered in a manner that fosters effective stewardship of Federal funds.<br /><br />The Office of Head Start is located at 1250 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C., and OGM and OPRE are located at 901 D Street, SW, Washington, D.C. Together OGM and OPRE provide a full range of grants and program management activities. OGM provides services such as: dissemination of guidance to applicants about due dates and funding levels; receipt of competitive applications and non-competing continuation of refunding applications; interaction and communication with grantees about submissions; review and clearance of all grants program announcements; management of the grant application review process; cost analyses of approved grant applications; generation of award documents; administration of awarded grants including receipt and approval of post-award change requests; providing training and technical assistance to program staff and their grantees; resolution of all audit findings; administrative closeout of expired grants. OPRE develops budgetary and programmatic guidance on research and other discretionary topics and guidance to operating program grantees as they develop their annual refunding submission, provides technical assistance to grantees on the programmatic and operational aspects of their grant, monitors and reviews all grantees every three years (including follow up reviews, desk reviews and special reviews), and determines whether grantees are entitled to continue receiving Federal funding. OHS works collaboratively with OGM to provide grantees with the full range of grants management and programmatic guidance and services.<br /><br />As a result of the rapid growth of the Head Start program (including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) which increased funding for the expansion of both HS/EHS programs by $2.1 billion in February 2009) and the relatively slower growth of Federal staff to manage the program, grantees have suffered from a lack of adequate attention to their growing and increasingly sophisticated needs for prompt and efficient grant-making assistance, to their need to communicate with grants and program staff in a timely manner, and to receive prompt and accurate responses to technical and program questions that arise in the course of managing Federal funds and providing Head Start services. The burden is especially evident with small grantees that lack the internal capacity to manage the increasingly complex requirements of Federally-assisted programs in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations.<br />&nbsp;<br />The purpose of this procurement is to obtain administrative and technical support to provide prompt, accurate and "user-friendly" assistance to Head Start grantees by providing high-quality grants management and programmatic services to them. Required tasks include maintaining a grant tracking system, assisting with establishing and maintaining official grant files, as well as supporting closeout activities for definite and indefinite project period grants, audit resolution activities, grant award and administration and participating in on-site program/fiscal reviews of Head Start agencies. Successful delivery of these services will require: (1) knowledge of and experience with the administration of discretionary grant programs, (2) an in-depth understanding of the Federal grants process, especially that of HHS, (3) demonstrated background and training in accounting and/or financial management, and (4) experience and knowledge of automated financial and program information systems. This requirement is limited to the support for Head Start grants administered by ACF in Washington, D.C. <br /><strong><br /><br />Capability Statement/Information Sought:<br /></strong>Respondents must provide as part of their response a capability statement, which demonstrates the following capabilities in order to provide the technical and administrative support described above:
<p>&bull; Corporate experience managing and administering grants administered by HHS/ACF or other federal government agencies.<br /><br />&bull; Capability to provide sufficient experienced, qualified staff with the proven ability to perform the required tasks, including the capability to provide staff needed to meet unforeseen, urgent assignments.<br /><br />&bull; Expertise in computer software applications (Windows, Microsoft Office 2007, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access).<br /><br />&bull; Capacity to navigate and utilize HHS/ACF web-based systems such as GATES (Grants Administration Tracking and Evaluation System), GABI (Grant Application Budget Instrument), PIR (Program Information Report), Grants.Gov (Head Start electronic applications), Office of Head Start Monitoring System (OHSMS) and Audit Tracking system</p>
<p><br />Respondents' must include their DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code. Include technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>Submissions should be sent electronically to Camille Timmerman, Contract Specialist, at Camille.Timmerman@psc.hhs.gov.

<p>Responses are due by 1:00PM EST on May 19, 2011. Responses will not be accepted after the due date.</p>

The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

<DESC>Sources Sought for PLAs Regarding Future Solicitation No.; W9126G-11-R-0117<br><br>Title:  <br>Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers Soliciting Comments on the Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) at FY11 VOLAR Barracks Renovation, Fort Polk, Louisiana<br><br>Description:   <br>The Corps of Engineers Fort Worth District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project: <br><br> FY11 VOLAR Barracks Renovation of 8 VOLAR Barracks and Site/Drainage Improvements, Fort Polk, Louisiana<br><br>Project Description includes the design/build renovation of 8 VOLAR barracks and site/drainage improvements to improve energy efficiency, eliminate mold and mildew, and provide a better living environment for the soldiers that will last for the next 20 years. Work will include redesign and renovation of eight (8) barracks to house one soldier per room; replacement of all water and sewer lines within the block; The original architectural and mechanical designs of the barracks and supporting central energy plants, accomplished in the 1970's, did not provide for adequate control of humidity levels within the occupied spaces, resulting in the growth of mold and mildew on interior surfaces. The intent of this project is to minimize vapor transmission through the building envelope, improve energy efficiency, eliminate standing water in crawl spaces, provide dehumidified make-up air to provide proper space relative humidity, sealing of building envelope to minimize infiltration and provide consistent and proper chilled water supply temperatures. The goal of the drainage upgrade and overall drainage rehabilitation is to contribute to the overall functional efficiency, improve quality of life, and reduce moisture<br>related problems resulting from poor drainage around the barracks.<br><br><br>Range of Magnitude:  $100 to $250 Million.<br><br>Period of Performance:   1330 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. <br><br>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br><br>  a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br>  b. The complexity of the project.<br>  c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br>  d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br>  e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br>  f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br>  g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br>  h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.<br><br>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br><br>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: <br><br>  a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br><br>  b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:<br><br>     1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br><br>    2. Be consistent with law.<br><br>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br><br>  a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?<br><br>  b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br><br>  c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<br><br>  d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?<br><br>  e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?<br><br>  f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.<br><br>  g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br><br>  h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?<br><br>  i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?<br><br>Please provide your comments via e-mail to Daisy Ciarlariello, Contract Specialist at daisy.ciarlarillo@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 13 May 2011.<br><br>Agency/Contracting Office:  <br>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District<br>ATTN: CESWF-CT (Rm 2A19)<br>819 Taylor Street<br>Fort Worth, Texas  76102-0300<br><br>Place of Performance:<br>Fort Polk Army Base<br>Vernon Parrish <br>Fort Polk, Texas 71459<br><br>Point of Contact:<br>Daisy Ciarlariello<br>Corps of Engineers<br>daisy.ciarlariello@usace.army.mil<br>Fort Worth District<br><br>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Omaha District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the Omaha/Lincoln Metro area.  A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement between a Prime contractor and one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S. C. 158(f).  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor, or certain subcontractors, engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law.   Reference: Provision:  52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement; Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br><br>Request responses to the following questions:<br><br>(1) Should a PLA be executed on selected large dollar contracts in the Omaha/Lincoln Metro area?<br>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<br>(7) What is the time impact of a PLA on a solicitation response?<br>(8) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in selected Omaha District Corps of Engineers contracts?<br><br><br>

The ICODES software application provides for a single, cross-service cargo planning and execution system for ship, air, rail conveyance estimation and yard/terminal management. This system is engineered to provide users with intelligent decision-support during administrative, preposition, and humanitarian assistance operations. Further, ICODES integrates multiple expert programs (agents), knowledge bases, and graphical user interfaces within a computer-based distributed cooperative operational environment. These capabilities are especially critical to the resolution of complex planning problems associated with the loading/discharge of military equipment in response to no notice/short notice contingencies. This product was developed by California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), Computer Aided Design Research Center (CADRC), and CDM Technologies, Inc in a series of contracts beginning in January 1993. The Government has an unlimited rights license to approximately 80% of the application, but the remainder, (.exe code) is proprietary to CDM.</p>
<p>Maintenance and enhancement of the ICODES system, requires proficiency and ability to demonstrate a working knowledge with systems software development using the following system programming languages/tools: JAVA, ActionScript (Flex), C++, C#, XML, SQL, Perl and Ant. Any interested parties should contact Ms Linda Murphy, Contract Specialist, at (618) 220-7101 or linda.murphy@ustranscom.mil for a copy of the ICODES code.</p>
<p>Parties requesting the ICODES software will be sent a CD together with a "problem statement" and further instructions pertaining to submission of a statement of capabilities for this effort, to include; explain steps, time, and cost involved.</p>

<SOLNBR>W912P5-11-P-0053
<ARCHDATE>08022011
<CONTACT>Isaac J. Taylor, 615-736-5679

<a href="mailto:isaac.j.taylor@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Nashville</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to SeaArk Marine, Inc. of Monticello, AR for restoration services to repair and refurbish one SeaArk Little Giant Work Boat (NP 220) owned and operated by the Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  This procurement has been approved for other than full and open competition under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The manufacturing process of the cathedral hull design of the Little Giant boat is unique to SeaArk.  The cathedral hull is considered a variable-degree dead-rise hull, with the V-shaped angle that is more prominent at the bow and gradually flattens further aft.  The restoration services cannot be performed without removal of the interior framework.  When removed, the hull will lose its shape.  Reshaping of the hull to the original form will require techniques and materials unique to SeaArk.  During reassembly, custom jigs must be used.  SeaArk owns these jigs.  As the hull framework is reconnected, maximum strength will be ensured only by using SeaArk's fabricated frameworks designed specifically to be mated to the Little Giant hull.  Refurbishment by SeaArk will also maintain continuity for all major structural components of this boat.  Also, any design improvements that have resulted from the 20 plus years of SeaArk operation will be incorporated into the restoration process.  If this procurement was competed and work performed by any other source, substantial duplication of costs would be incurred by requiring the expenditure of approximately $26,960 of Government labor for the development of performance specifications and to ensure quality and safety standards are satisfied for work being performed on the structural components of this boat.  This amount has been estimated by assuming two technical representatives (GS-12) direct charge a rate of $125/hour spend 80 hours ($20,000) on the development of performance specifications and drawings, attendance of site visits (pre-award and Quality Assurance), addressing technical matters, and the oversight of quality assurance during contract performance, one contract specialist (GS-9) direct charges at a rate of $58/hour spends 120 hours ($6,960) on contracting oversight and the development of a competitive solicitation.   It is expected these efforts would not be required if these services were obtained by SeaArk.  These costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  In addition, some data required to develop performance specifications may not be available since it is proprietary to SeaArk.  If another entity performs the refurbishment it may become difficult in the future to obtain a critical, structural repair from the original manufacturer due to work performed by another vendor.  In addition to performance, safety of the vessel for her crew is vital.  Logically, the proven performance of the original manufacturer bolsters safety credentials.  With the above rationale, there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the Nashville District USACE's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the unique capabilities of SeaArk Marine, Inc.  The Federal Acquisition Regulations allow for the submission of capability statements from prospective offerors to show interest which shall be considered by the Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  This is not a request for capability statements, proposals, bids, or quotations.  However, the Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will consider any capability statements, proposals, bids, or quotations submitted by all responsible sources.  Depending on the evaluation result of the capability statements, the Contracting Officer will determine if this sole source action is justified or if a solicitation must be issued to interested firms.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  If you choose to submit information, please provide past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this supply and service along with your statement of capability.  The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide. Information provided is strictly voluntary.  Please email capability statements or proposals to James.E.Choate@usace.army.mil.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.  The closing date for submission of capability statements or proposals is May 9, 2011 at 7:00 AM Central Standard Time.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc. of Amherst, NY for highly specialized services to update the existing finite element analysis model of Chickamauga Lock for the effects of concrete expansion due to alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR), combined with other applicable loads (dead load, post-tensioning, hydrostatic, thermal, etc.). The work will require the Contractor to calibrate the existing model to measured deflections and stresses from existing data survey points, inverted pendulums, growth meters, crack meters, joint meters, slot movement measurements and tendon strain meters and an initial analysis of present structure behavior.  Using the calibrated model, the Contractor shall conduct an analysis with the current lock configuration that evaluates an additional 10 years of AAR effects.  This procurement has been approved for other than full and open competition under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  It has been determined that the Government will incur substantial duplication of costs of approximately $850,000, for the AE services described above if not obtained by the continued provision of Hatch. The existing model is owned by Hatch and no other contractor can update, calibrate, or perform analysis using Hatch's proprietary model. Award to any Contractor other than Hatch to perform the described services would require the Contractor to develop a new model. From contract records it is evident the Nashville District USACE has incurred contract expenditures in excess of $720,000 for the development of the existing model. Similar costs would be incurred, that could not be recovered through competition, for the development of a new model. Since the development of the existing model, the Corps of Engineers has also expended approximately $130,000 on in-house labor verifying the accuracy of the model. These costs are computed using $1000 a day with 4 people looking at the various iterations of contracted models for over 30 days. A new model would also require similar costs for in-house labor to verify the accuracy of the model. In addition to these expenditures, the Tennessee Valley Association (TVA) has reported expending over $500,000 for the development of the existing model. It is therefore in the best interests to obtain the services described above by procuring from Hatch.  The Federal Acquisition Regulations allow for the submission of capability statements from prospective offerors to show interest which shall be considered by the Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  This is not a request for capability statements, proposals, bids, or quotations.  However, the Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will consider any capability statements, proposals, bids, or quotations submitted by all responsible sources.  Depending on the evaluation result of the capability statements, the Contracting Officer will determine if this sole source action is justified or if a solicitation must be issued to interested firms.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  If you choose to submit information, please provide past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this supply and service along with your statement of capability.  The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide. Information provided is strictly voluntary.  Please email capability statements or proposals to James.E.Choate@usace.army.mil.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.  The closing date for submission of capability statements or proposals is May 19, 2011 at 7:00 AM Central Standard Time.

<DESC>PURPOSE OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI):<br><br>1.This notice constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) as contemplated by FAR 10.002(b)(2)(iii) and (v).<br><br>INTRODUCTION:<br>In order to meet United States Army renewable energy and sustainability goals, as well as accommodate increasing need for photovoltaic (PV) panels in the near future, United States Army Corps of Engineers Huntsville Support Center (HNC) is looking for information from industry to help guide a potential future acquisition. Specifically, HNC is considering PV panel* source of supply contract(s) that includes a minimum cumulative order guarantee in return for a discounted unit price available to all PV installers under contract with HNC.  <br>The Army is a large quantity PV buyer, but is not recognized as such because the vast majority of PV purchases are made by PV installers under contract with the Army.  These proxy purchases only occasionally qualify for quantity discounts.  Near future Army projects have a potential value of $70 million in total PV projects, notably from the Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) and Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC).  **NOTE: The minimum order amount would be 5-10% of the potential value. However, it is impractical for the Army to order all its PV requirements at one time each fiscal year.  Thus the interest in minimum cumulative order guarantees that would prompt industry to offer maximum discounts for all orders throughout an ordering period.  <br><br>SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST:<br>HNC is interested in finding out what minimum cumulative order guarantees (US dollars) would be necessary for industry to offer corresponding unit price discounts  to HNC including PV installers under contract with HNC throughout a specified ordering period (assume one year ordering period for purposes of this RFI).  A PV installer under contract with HNC would submit a copy of the HNC contract to the PV supplier.  The PV installer holding a supply contract envisioned by this RFI would honor the discount price only for the quantity of PV contracted to be installed. HNC would track PV orders against the minimum cumulative order guarantee and would help the PV supplier confirm installer eligibility for the Army discount. <br>HNC is also interested in the lead time required to fulfill PV panel orders according to different quantities and the current annual production capacity. Purpose of this information is to determine how many PV supply contract sources may be necessary to ensure timely delivery of $70M worth of PV panels in a given year and avoid a backlog of PV panel orders.<br>HNC is interested in identifying sources for technical information about the PV panels as related to sustainable manufacturing processes and Buy American Act compliance.        <br>* All PV panels would have to meet Buy American Act (41 U. S. C. 10a et seq)<br>       <br>SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS:<br>FAR 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)<br>(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br>(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br>(c) This request for Information is issued for the purpose of: obtaining information to assist the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Support Center in developing a contracting strategy for the procurement of discounted photovoltaic (PV) panels either directly or by proxy (HNC contractors with PV panel requirements)  (End of Clause)<br><br>2. All proprietary material in the submission package shall be clearly identified and will be treated in the strictest confidence.<br><br>3.  There is no question and answer period for this RFI. <br><br>4. Written responses to this RFI specifically addressing the items above (new and innovative approaches, experience, current capabilities), are limited to twenty pages, and should be submitted to Mr. Earl W. Johnson, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at earl.w.johnson@usace.army.mil no later than 5:00 p.m. CST, May 16, 2011.

<DESC><strong>PLEASE ADD NAME TO INTERESTED VENDOR'S LIST FOR FULL COPY OF THE SOLICITATION OR CALL BRIAN COOPER 505-346-3811</strong>
<p><br />The contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, supplies, transportation, equipment and materials (except for Government furnished property) needed to conduct formal monitoring of sixteen known Mexican spotted owl (MSO) Protected Activity Centers (PACs) in the San Mateo and Magdalena Mountains of central New Mexico. All monitoring will be done according to established protocol to determine presence/absence and reproductive success.</p>
<p>The contractor shall submit completed forms, maps, digital images and a final report of all findings.</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>A four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended, but not necessary. Conditions of track roads can be poor when wet. Some of the access roads can be rough.</p>
<p>The 2011 weather is forecast for warm temperatures and continued dry conditions. The entire Cibola National Forest was under Fire Restrictions in the past and restrictions are expected this year. Campfires, charcoal grills and stove fires were prohibited on national forest lands except in developed camp and picnic grounds where grills were provided. Smoking was allowed within an enclosed vehicle or building; a developed recreation site; or while stopped in an area at least three feet in diameter and free of all flammable material. If dry conditions continue, the District may be under a total closure again during the 2011 MSO monitoring season. In that case, the contractor may be given specific written permission to continue survey work during the closure.</p>
<p>Mexican spotted owl Monitoring</p>
<p>MSO monitoring may be performed beginning as soon as the contract is awarded and will be completed by August 31, 2011. Upon completion of the field survey, the Contractor shall have 21 calendar days to deliver the Final Report to the COR.</p>
<p>Informal monitoring and/or pre-calling daytime visits may be done to known nest sites within MSO PACs during dates established in the MSO protocol included in this package (Pre-calling Daytime Visits). If MSO are located during informal and/or pre-calling visits, only reproductive success visits would need to be done thereafter.</p>
<p>If MSO are not located during daytime visits, formal MSO monitoring shall be performed according to the MSO protocol attached to this contract package. Only the actual PAC areas need formal monitoring.</p>
<p>Any location marking method, such as flagging or Brite Eyes, may be used to mark calling routes or routes to nest/roost locations. All markers placed during this contract must be removed at the conclusion of the contract. GPS locations will be taken for each route and placed on the standard topographic maps described above.</p>
<p>If a MSO flies or appears to be located on private land, no attempts will be made to cross ownership boundaries. Contractor will show direction of flight on a map included in the final report, or estimate the location of the area a MSO appears to be located in.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to assure all persons conducting the monitoring work meet training and certification requirements. Proof of training and required Region 3 certification shall be provided to the Contracting Officer prior to award, for crew leaders and preferably all crewmembers. (Crewmembers certified after award of contract must show certification prior to initiation of fieldwork).</p>
<p>Monitoring information shall be documented on the MSO monitoring forms (attached).</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Contractor to determine local conditions affecting road access to each site. Notify the COR within 2 working days if weather caused road inaccessibility (on an open road) is delaying work.</p>
<p>C.4 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>All required forms (inventory, daytime follow-up, etc) shall be completed in accordance with the protocol/guideline requirements and shall be submitted in accordance with the specifications in C and as part of the Deliverables, as specified in C.</p>
<p>Any spotted owl nest or roost trees located shall be photo-documented in daytime on digital format and labeled with Ranger District, UTM, content of photo (i.e. nest site, roost site, MSO chick, MSO female, etc) and date. Original digital image shall become property of the Government. At least one nest tree photo will be from enough distance to show the entire tree.</p>
<p>Locations of active MSO nest sites other than those previously active shall be plotted on the topographic map and shall be cross-referenced in the report. Use UTM's to describe the nest site on the topographic map. GPS coordinates shall be provided by the contractor.</p>
<p>Active spotted owl PAC's shall be reported to the COR within 2 working days. These shall be reported by PAC name, unless a new territory is discovered at which time a PAC name will be determined by the agency biologist.</p>
<p>C.5 GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED PROPERTY</p>
<p>The government-furnished property listed below will be available for contractor use. Some of the material will be available after the contractor has been selected:</p>
<p>1. Mexican spotted owl PAC Maps/Magdalena Ranger District Map (available upon award of contract)<br />(exhibit A1 and A2) _20__ pages</p>
<p>2. One set of spotted owl Monitoring Data forms (Exhibit B-C)<br /><br />3. Mexican Spotted Owl Formal Monitoring Protocol (FS Interim Directive No. 2 dated 6/26/90) (Exhibit D).</p>

This solicitation is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM), NIDDK Acquisitions Branch would like to procure a mouse breeding service contract.  Our lab has generated mutant mouse strains lacking M1-M5 muscarinic receptors (M1-M5 single KO mice) as well as several muscarinic receptor double KO mice.  There are 7 single KO strains, 5 double KO strains and approximately 5-10 shipments per strain per year.  All mice are housed in another facility and are homozygous mutants, except for the WT control strains.  Also, there are no special clinical/veterinary issues with any of these strains.   Analysis of these animals should clarify the physiological and pathophysiological roles that the individual muscaranic receptors play in vivo.  Given the potential roles of these receptors subtypes in human disease including diabetes and obesity, these mouse lines are of great potential therapeutic relevance.  This ongoing service is to be set-up as a base year with two option years and is needed to maintain small colonies of mice, to include:  breeding cages, replacement breeder cages, biopsy collection and PCR genotyping.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) is a Center of the NOAA Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO). The AOC fleet of 12 aircraft (of which 10 are operational and are applicable to this RFQ) is flown in support of NOAA's mission to promote global environmental assessment, prediction, and stewardship of the earth's environment. A support staff at AOC of approximately 95 employees operates these aircraft throughout the United States and around the world. Eight aircraft are headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, FL, and are, for the most part, maintained in Tampa, FL at an AOC owned-and-operated maintenance facility. The remaining four aircraft are based at various locations throughout the country and are maintained by AOC through contractual arrangements with a multiplicity of commercial aircraft maintenance facilities. Currently, most activities related to aircraft operational management including maintenance, parts inventory, and accounting are managed using a local Oracle v9.2i database and a contracted, proprietary software system. The current volume of data in this database is equivalent to a text export of 15 Megabytes. Flight management data including pilot and flight records are currently stored locally in a Microsoft Access database. Other accounting, training, document control, and operational data are stored in various small spreadsheets or data tables. More detailed information on NOAA's AOC can be found at www.aoc.noaa.gov.</p>
<p>SCOPE:<br />AOC has identified the need for an integrated database system capable of managing information critical to the function of its aviation program. For the purposes of this document, these functions are categorized broadly as 1) flight management; 2) maintenance; 3) inventory; and, 4) accounting. Information currently stored in AOC databases and spreadsheets must be integrated to form a new centralized data clearinghouse for aircraft management data. An integrated architecture will allow for more efficient data storage and recovery, provide greater access to operationally critical information, and offer more effective management tools. To realize these benefits, AOC is requesting quotes from vendors that will satisfy the following requirements.</p>
<p>Personnel must be able to interact with the aviation data management system quickly, easily, and securely. A web-based front end client shall provide access to the data system and utilize Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or comparable security technology. The proposed data system solution may be hosted on the OMAO IT system or located offsite and provided by the contractor. A tiered (web and data) server architecture is preferred, with security features such as redundant but distant servers, frequent data backups, and uninterruptable power. These features are available on the OMAO network and may be utilized by the offeror as Government Furnished Equipment. Microsoft software including Windows Server and SQL Server 2008 is also available on OMAO equipment; however, the Oracle database software in use at AOC is not available for the proposed data system. If the offeror is capable of providing a solution for both the contractor-owned and OMAO-owned IT systems, two separate proposals must be submitted. The solution must be in compliance with CAR 1352.239-72 Security Requirements for Information Technology Resources (APR 2010). In accordance with the Federal Information Processing Standard 199 "Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems" (FIPS199) and NIST Special Publication 60 "Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories:" (SP800-60), NOAA's Information Technology System NOAA2010 "OMAO Land Based Support System" (LBSS) Risk Categorization has been identified as Moderate Confidentiality, Moderate Integrity, and Moderate Availability, for an overall rating Categorization of Moderate Impact. If the proposed solution is based on using the OMAO owned IT system, the Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) requirements of Clause 1352.239-72 do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>To be used effectively as a management tool, the aviation data management system must offer extendable data entry and reporting capabilities that allow custom forms and reports to be generated in-house. AOC personnel must be able to build customized data reports in a reasonably short period of time with minimal effort. The aviation data management system shall provide the means to query the stored data and generate reports from the queries. The queries shall allow searches on any one substantive record attribute or combination of attributes, and allow the use of wildcard characters. The reports shall present query results using text and/or optional bar graphs, line graphs, and pie charts. To ensure that AOC functional and schedule requirements are met, design reviews shall be conducted biweekly (at a minimum) between the contractor and the AOC project manager. A preliminary design review shall occur before completion of Line Item 0001 and serve to communicate AOC design requirements and the vendor's data migration and system design strategy. A critical design review shall occur before the final operating capability is achieved to ensure that AOC design requirements will be met. The preliminary and critical design reviews shall include AOC representatives knowledgeable in each functional category (flight management, maintenance, inventory, and accounting) and take place at AOC.</p>
<p>Technical support shall be offered by the contractor to address problems with or modifications to the aviation data management system, and be included for equipment and software furnished by the contractor. Technical support requests from AOC shall be addressed within 24 hours. Access to the system shall be controlled through an administrative role that may be performed by select individuals at AOC. Privileges to perform administrative, read and write functions shall be controlled independently through the administrative role.</p>
<p>The contractor must supply complete documentation of data system user functions by the final operating capability of the aviation data management system. The capability to download a copy of the raw aviation data must also be provided by final operating capability.</p>
<p>Account access shall be granted to 95 AOC users and initial end-user training provided to 40 AOC users at the MacDill AFB location. If appropriate to the system, module-specific training shall be provided. The proposal shall also include a "train the trainer" style program for 3 additional AOC personnel at the MacDill AFB location.</p>
<p>I. Flight Management: <br />Flight and flight crew records shall be accessible from outside AOC, allowing remote data entry and reporting with controlled access. Data currently entered in the daily flight log (see attached sample), with the following changes, shall be recorded on an electronic form and submitted to the database. The flight log changes include:<br />1) remove the "Blue" category from Section 5,<br />2) allow the entry of a complete fuel expense record (see Accounting section below) to replace the fuel service block (Section 6),<br />3) allow miscellaneous expenses to be logged (see Accounting section below),<br />4) allow aircraft location, location address, location phone number, pilot location, location address, and pilot phone number to be entered,<br />5) increase the size of the remarks block (Section 9) to allow for at least 2000 characters of text,<br />6) add a new block that allows for annotation of the utilization code of the flight (i.e. O, U, M, L, or C,) and<br />7) Account for dropsonde performance in Section 10 (e.g. good, no data, free-fall, etc.).</p>
<p>The flight log form shall allow one or more funding codes to be entered for the flight, selectable from a list of applicable codes. The form shall have an option to copy data from the previous flight for a particular aircraft, so that a minimal amount of new flight data is required to fill the form and data entry errors are reduced. The form shall quality check the entered flight time aviation data between block, flight, project, personnel, aircraft, and training times to identify any potential entry or calculation errors before the log is submitted. The user shall be notified with a warning that a discrepancy has been found and asked if the change should be made by the system. The aviation data management system shall allow the submission of flight information directly to the database through a local or remote connection, and then automatically send an email including the filled flight log to a customizable distribution list. A mission situation report shall also be generated from submitted flight, mission, and location information, and be sent by email to a distribution list. The distribution list will be provided to the contractor on request following the contract award. The situation report is a daily report on aircraft activity that contains the aircraft and crew location and contact information, utilization code, flight number, flight time, and remarks.</p>
<p>A flight schedule shall be maintained and reported daily in the following form. The flight schedule daily report shall include the following statistical data for the current month and fiscal year: total number of flights, total flight hours, total hours flown for Aircraft Services, total hours flown for Programs, and total hours flown for Reimbursable Projects. The body of the report shall contain the following information: current calendar day and next calendar day itineraries for all aircraft assigned to AOC, location of each aircraft, phone number of aircraft location, crew location, task code and project name for aircraft mission if assigned to a project, a color coded aircraft status (green for up and red for down), notes concerning the aircraft status, crewmember positions, and assigned personnel. Additionally, the flight schedule daily report shall include remarks entered at the time of the generation of the report. The ability to print the flight schedule daily report in a legible font on no more than two 8.5x11 pages, shall be provided ( an example of a flight schedule report is attached). If a crewmember qualification is expired and the crewmember has been assigned to a flight, a warning shall be issued at the time of the generation of the report. The aviation data management system shall allow the entry of the flight schedule and generation of the report directly through a local or remote connection, and then automatically send an email including the flight schedule daily report to a customizable distribution list.</p>
<p>The aviation data management system shall be able to accommodate the data currently stored in ELOG (the flight management Microsoft Access database) and use it effectively in the forms and reports described herein. The structure of the ELOG database is provided in the following documents which are separate attachments:<br />Diagram for Electronic LOG (ELOG) Database 091007.pdf<br />Definition for Electronic LOG (ELOG) Database 091007.pdf<br /><br />The aviation data management system shall be able to track medical, flight, and ground training qualifications of AOC employees and aircrew, and provide automated email warnings of approaching and passed expiration dates for training qualifications.

A quoter who meets the requirement of this factor will receive further consideration. <br /><br />The quoter must provide a timeline for completing CLINs 0001, 0002, and 0003. The Government requires delivery to be made according to the following schedule which is based on the anticipated award date of April 29, 2011. <br /><br />Required Delivery Schedule:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: Initial Operating Capability: May 27, 2011<br />CLIN 0002: Data Management System Design Services: August 26, 2011<br />CLIN 0003: Final Operating Capability: September 30, 2011</p>
<p>FACTOR 3 - KEY PERSONNEL: This factor will be evaluated by the variable decisional rule. In the trade-off process, this rule uses distinctions based on merit. NOAA will evaluate the experience of the proposed key personnel (Project Manager) to determine the extent to which his or her background, education, work experience, and accomplishments demonstrate his or her ability to effectively perform the role for which he or she is proposed.</p>
<p>The quoter shall provide evidence that the proposed key personnel (Project Manager) to be assigned to this project has knowledge and experience of an aviation data management system.</p>
<p>FACTOR 4 - PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The past performance information will be evaluated on quality of product or service, cost control, timeliness of performance and business relations, to determine its relevance to the current requirements and to the extent to which it demonstrates that the quoter has successfully completed contracts which are of similar scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to the aviation data management system requirements. If a quoter has no relevant past performance history, a quoter must affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance history. The Government will assign a neutral rating to quotes with no relevant past performance.<br /><br />Quoters shall provide past performance information regarding contracts which are similar in nature to this aviation data management system requirement and which it has performed in the last three (3) years. The contracts may include those entered into with Federal, State and local governments, and commercial businesses, which are of similar scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to the aviation data management system requirements which is described in the RFQ.</p>
<p>Quoters shall submit at least three (3) past performance references. Include the following information for each reference:</p>
<p>(a)Name of contracting activity<br />(b)Contract number<br />(c)Contract title<br />(d)Contract type<br />(e)Contracting Officer, telephone number, and email address<br />(f)Program Manager/Project Officer, telephone number, and email address</p>
<p>Quoters must send Client Authorization Letters (see attached) to each reference listed in their quote to assist in the timely processing of the past performance evaluation. Quoters should send the Client Authorization letters electronically to their references with copies to the Contract Specialist on or before the due date for submission of quotes. A Past Performance Questionnaire (see attached) will be used to collect information on a quoter's performance. The Contract Specialist will send the Past Performance Questionnaire to each reference listed in the quote.</p>
<p>Technical, delivery schedule, key personnel and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. As the technical ratings become more equal, price becomes more important. Conversely, as price proposals become more equal to one another, technical proposals will become a more important determining factor. NOAA will evaluate the quoter's proposed prices for fairness and reasonableness in relation to the RFQ's requirements.</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Amendment notice (May 4, 2011): This solicitation is amended to add additional CLINs to the requirement for the specialties of audiology and behavioral health. Acknowledge consideration of this amendment and date in proposals submitted.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) and is unrestricted. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-50, March 16, 2011. The Government intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a single Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract with one (1) base year and two (2) option years. The subsequent contract will be awarded using FAR Part 13.5 procedures.<br /><br />This solicitation is being reissued pursuant to the policy memorandum dated 24 November 2010 by the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, titled "Improving Competition in Defense Procurements." The previous solicitation number was W91QUF1106C001 with a closing date of 26 April 2011.<br /><br />This solicitation is for a non-personal health care services contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical, professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The contractor indemnifies the Government for any liability producing act or omission by the contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Government requires the contractor to maintain medical liability insurance, in coverage amounts which are not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services, contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. The minimum of $3,000 shall be ordered on this contract and the maximum contract amount over the life of the contract, including all options if exercised, is $400,000. The minimum contract amount of $3,000 may be met by one or more orders during the base year of the contract.<br /><br />Primary place of performance is Togus VA Hospital, Augusta, ME, with periodic performance at various armory locations throughout the State of Maine. The capability of contractors to provide mobile-based medical services for any and all specialities in the contract is desired. Description of requirement: The Maine Army National Guard (MEARNG) requires Periodic Health Assessments (PHA) to include: dental screening and treatment, immunization updating, physical exams, phlebotomy, vision screening, womens health screening and MEDPROS and DENCLASS systems updating of service members during a one (1) year base period beginning 2 June 2011, the anticipated award date, with two (2) option years exercised at the discretion of the Government. The government may inspect facilities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. (MEDPROS and DENCLASS are available through the Army Medical Operation Data System [MODS] at www.mods.army.mil.) Performance Standards: In accordance with the Performance Work Statement, the contractor shall provide, in a fixed or mobile setting, all management, labor, material, personal equipment, certifications and supplies necessary to provide Medical services, dental examinations, dental treatments, health and dental record updating, MEDPROS and DENCLASS updating. <br /><br />The first anticipated task order against the resulting ID/IQ contract is planned for 4 June 2011 for a PHA/PDHRA event.<br /><br />Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors---Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Award will be made based on an evaluation of the criteria of price, past performance and technical capability. Provision for Evaluation: Award will be made to the contractor whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government. In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.304 and 15.305 and the clause at 52.212-2, the Government will consider the following for award: 1) Price; 2) Past Performance; 3) Technical Capability. A consideration when evaluating technical capability will be continuity of personnel offered by the contractor. Continuity of personnel will limit the need for constant training of new personnel month to month. Past Performance and Technical Capability, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The offeror must demonstrate in the proposal the capability to meet all contract requirements through past performance at similar events (assessing military members for medical fitness to standards in accordance with Army Regulation 40-501, chapter 3, 7 and 8), either as the prime or first tier subcontractor, and by identification of key personnel that have past performance experience. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price standpoint. Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss, or revise your proposal. Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their proposal. Request for such information does not constitute discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. <br /><br />CLINS renumbered as of amendment posted May 4, 2011.<br />Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs):<br />Priced 0001, Physician Services<br />Priced 0002, Physician Assistant / Nurse Practioner Services<br />Priced 0003, Registered Nurse Services<br />Priced 0004, Phlebotomist Services<br />Priced 0005, Dentist Services<br />Priced 0006, Optometrist Services<br />Priced 0007, Audiology Services<br />Priced 0008, Behavioral Health Services<br />Priced 0009, Mobile medical/dental exam facilities<br />Priced 0010, Army Contractor Manpower Reporting Requirement (yearly requirement).

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) cancels Request for Proposals (RFP) H92222-10-R-0016, Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR) in its entirety.&nbsp; No award will be made as a result of this RFP.&nbsp; The Government has reassessed the evaluation criteria that would render best value awards for the PSR.&nbsp; The current PSR RFP evaluation criteria falls short in accurately assessing the quality and capability of the proposed weapons and therefore it is in the Government's best interest to cancel the RFP.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall scientific and/or technical merit, including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, and understanding of the technical and operational approach for evaluation of the technology; (2) The effort's potential contribution and relevance to the U. S. Air Force's Full Spectrum Cyber Operations Technology, to include testing of prototype capabilities and Information Assurance requirements; (3) The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge; and (4) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs, and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: For classification guidance see section IV paragraph 5. "Classification Guidance for White Paper Submissions"</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET, TOP SECRET (TS), or TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access at the appropriate level at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html .</p>

The requirements are more fully described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  In order to determine which vendors have the required capabilities and expertise for the SOW requirements, the FAA requires interested Vendors to explain and describe their capabilities and recent past experience in performing in ALL functional areas listed in the attached OES SOW in their response.  The response should pertain only to contracts of a similar size and complexity as that represented per the draft statement of work provided with this announcement.  For purposes of this assessment, be advised that the estimated value of this procurement is $41M for a period of 5 years.   
This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.3.11.  Interested parties are advised that:
 This is not a SIR or Request for Proposals; The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals; The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred  in preparing the response to the market survey; and Any costs associated with the market survey response submittals are solely at the interested party's expense.
Details of this announcement are listed below:
1.  PurposeThe purpose of this Market Survey is to: (1) Ascertain industry capability and capacity levels for both small and large businesses relative to the functional areas cited, and to improve the Government understanding of the current marketplace to identify qualified and capable sources to perform the services described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  (2) Survey the marketplace to assess the level of interest among qualified service providers (small or large businesses) of the required services.
2. Description of the Required ServicesThe FAA ATO Finance Services Office of Enterprise Solutions Group's primary objective is to select and implement resource management efficiencies via performance-based business solutions and targeted acquisitions.  This is accomplished through studies and analyses of resources, systems, policies, procedures, technical operations, and organizational structure.  This, in turn, leads to more comprehensive acquisition planning, resource planning, and business process re-engineering.
The contractor will provide a broad range of support services relating to Staffing Standards and Schedule Optimization Analysis, Resource Planning and Analysis, Financial Analysis, Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), Acquisition Planning, Implementation and Transition, Performance Metric Development and Monitoring, Strategic Planning and Policy Development. The requirements are more fully described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  
3.  NAICS CodeThe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these requirements is 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a size standard of $7 Million. 
4.  Responses to the Market SurveyInterested parties should submit the following information in response to this Market Survey by May 23, 2011.
(a) A one-page letter of transmittal. (b) A statement of capabilities and past experience not to exceed eight pages (12 point Times New Roman font or similar with 1 inch margins or greater) that address your company's capabilities and past experience for each of the following nine functional areas:  
-  Contract Management-  Staffing Standards and Schedule Optimization Analysis, -  Resource Planning and Analysis, -  Financial Analysis, -  Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), -  Acquisition Planning, -  Implementation and Transition, -  Performance Metric Development and Monitoring, -  Strategic Planning and Policy Development 
Your response should address each of the eight functional areas in the same order as shown above and should address both your capabilities and capacity.  Capacity should be addressed in terms of the size of your company (FTEs and revenue) as well as in the specific past experiences (previous contracts) described in the response for each functional area.  For any of the eight functional areas where your company has no capability, capacity and/or past experience the response should clearly identify this lack of capability, capacity and/or past experience.  
The response should also address:  
 A list of contracts under which your company has provided these types of services in the past 5 years including the name of the contract, client, your company's staffing level on the contract (# of FTEs), contract total price or value, your company's percentage of the total staffing on the contract, and your company's role on the contract (prime or subcontractor).  Number of years your company has been in business. Geographical areas where your company can provide the noted services without charging the government any long distance travel costs.   The government plans for all work to be accomplished in the Washington DC Metropolitan area and does not intend to pay long-distance travel expenses. (c) A completed and signed Business Declaration Form attached to this Market Survey.
For purposes of this market research effort, should a response be vague or unclear with respect to capability, capacity and/or past experience in any of the eight areas, the government will conclude that the responder lacks capability and/or capacity in that specific area to perform these services at the noted anticipated size and level of complexity (as depicted per the draft SOW and estimated value).   
If any of the information submitted is considered to be proprietary or business sensitive, the submitter is responsible for marking it accordingly.

<DESC>Type of Notification:   Request for Proposal (RFP) for Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
NOTE - THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  DOE will only accept proposals from small businesses that do not exceed the small business size standard of $25.5M in average annual receipts under NAICS code 484230 "Specialized Freight (except used goods) Trucking, Long-Distance."
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is procuring the continuation of carrier services for the award of a contract or contracts for the transport of contact-handled (CH) and remote-handled (RH) transuranic (TRU) wastes and mixed hazardous constituents, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and asbestos between various DOE sites across the country and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico.   
The transport of TRU waste is accomplished by contract carriers that transport the waste via public highways on custom designed trailers in Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved packages.  The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract using firm-fixed- price delivery task orders over a five-year contract period, consisting of a one year base ordering period and four additional one-year option ordering periods.  
This procurement will replace two existing carrier contracts that will expire March 2012 and September 2012, respectively.  Two contracts are anticipated to be awarded by March 2012. The carriers are responsible for transitioning the work from the current carrier contractors without interruption, and maintaining the WIPP disposal schedule.
Contractor proposals are requested by May 17, 2011.  THE RFP CAN BE FOUND AT: www.emcbc.doe.gov/WIPP/index.php
Interested parties are encouraged to view the website at www.emcbc.doe.gov/WIPP/index.php regularly for information about this procurement as it will be the primary conduit with which to provide such information.

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) intends to issue a Prospectus soliciting for proposals in response to a business opportunity to operate overnight accommodations, food and beverage, retail, fuel, and firewood services at Kalaloch Lodge within Olympic National Park.
The NPS will issue the Prospectus on Thursday, May 5, 2011, under the terms described in the Prospectus.  The existing Concession Contract between the NPS and the existing Concessioner expires on December 31, 2011.  The Director, pursuant to 36 C.F.R. Part 51, has determined that the existing Concessioner is NOT a preferred Offeror for the Contract to be awarded.  The term of the new Concession Contract will be for ten (10) years.  Any proposal, including that of the existing Concessioner, must be received by the National Park Service, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Attn: Business Management Office, Fort Mason, Building 201, San Francisco, California, 94123 no later than ninety-one (91) days from May 5, 2011, in order to be evaluated and considered for award of a Concession Contract.  The Pacific West Regional Office is moving from Oakland, CA to San Francisco, CA during the period of time in which the proposals are due, therefore the location for which all Offerors submit the proposals must be submitted to Golden Gate National Recreation Area, rather than the address on the inside front cover of the posted Prospectus.
Proposals are due no later than 4:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) Thursday, August 4, 2011.  There is a printing cost recovery charge of $50 per copy to be delivered via Federal Express or $40 per copy if picked up in person.  Checks or money orders (no cash or credit cards accepted) must be payable to the National Park Service; and you must include a business address (no post office box) to receive a Federal Express package.  Prospectus packages will be available by contacting Kimberley Gagliolo, Commercial Services Specialist, Pacific West Region, Commercial Services, via telephone at 510-817-1368 or 510-914-9815 or you may email Kimberley Gagliolo at kim_gagliolo@nps.gov.  The Prospectus will also be available after May 5, 2011, at http://concessions.nps.gov/index.htm.
If you choose to retrieve a copy of the Prospectus from the NPS website please notify Kimberley Gagliolo, so you are placed on the mailing list to receive notifications of any future modifications or other correspondence.  A one-day site visit, as previously announced, is scheduled for Thursday, May 19, 2011.  If you would like to participate in this site visit, you must RSVP to Kimberley Gagliolo (kim_gagliolo@nps.gov) for additional information regarding the time and location of the site visit and to reserve a spot.  Potential Offerors are encouraged to visit the Concession operation and facilities, however the NPS will perform only one site visit on the date identified above.

The Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Norfolk VA intends to negotiate a 100 % small business set-aside Firm Fixed-Price contract for Band Recording  Engineer services at the Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, D.C. for the United States Air Force Band (USAF). The services will be acquired in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13  Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The required services shall support a one year base period of 1 June 2011 through 31 May 2012 and 2 one-year option periods that will conclude on 31 May 2014 along with FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services. All options will be evaluated.
  The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 512210 with a small business size standard of $7.0 million. An amendment will be available for download on or about 5 May 2011 at the following websites: http://www.neco.navy.mil, www.fbo.gov.  Potential vendors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will ONLY be available by downloading the documents at the above web sites.  This office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations.  By submitting a quote, the vendor will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.
  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the quote.  Through its submission, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the Central contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for award to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a vendor ineligible for award.  Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-999-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. The NECO website has a submit bid button next to the solicitation number.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has a requirement for one Engineering Model Main Reflector, three flight Main Reflectors, three flight Cold Sky Reflectors, and the corresponding Ground Support Equipment as defined in the Statement of Work. These items are for the Microwave Imager/Sounder (MIS) payload as part of a larger Class 1 Operational National Program. The Main Reflector is an offset parabolic reflector that focuses scene energy that is collected and processed by the spacecraft's systems. The Cold Sky Reflector is a parabolic reflector that provides a view of cold (~2.7 K) space that is collected and processed by the spacecraft's systems. The measurements from the Cold Sky Reflector enable the systems to calibrate on each scan. The Specifications are export controlled under the International Traffic In Arms Regulation (ITAR). As such, in order to receive the referenced specifications, potential contractors must complete the attached certification with proof of status (e.g. Birth Certificate, Passport, Military ID)&nbsp;as a US Person (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Part 120.15) and submit it via email to Kirsten Pilkerton at kirsten.pilkerton@nrl.navy.mil. Upon confirmation of eligibility and the release of the solicitation, potential offerors will be sent copies of the statement of work and specifications. The statement of work and specifications must be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with applicable US export control laws and regulations. It is anticipated that a&nbsp;Firm Fixed Price&nbsp;contract will be made as a result of the solicitation. NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued. <br />
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm. The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>

<p>The Government considers attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive offer. It will enable the Contractor to become acquainted with the work areas. Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions or miscalculations in offers. It is emphasized that it is more advantageous for each Offeror to have qualified representation at the pre-proposal conference. While the conference will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify the solicitation provisions, nothing said or represented in the conference will be deemed to modify the solicitation requirements unless followed by a written amendment.</p>
<p>BONDING: Bonding will be required.<br />FAR 52.228-1 Bid Guarantee (SEP 96)<br />FAR 52.228-15 Performance and Payment Bonds-Construction (Nov 2006)</p>

<DESC>This Modification adds the following:  Provide your response to barbara.a.young@usace.army.mil and ensure your response is limited to 5 pages.<br><br>The Corps of Engineers Omaha District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the Omaha/Lincoln Metro area.  A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement between a Prime contractor and one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S. C. 158(f).  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor, or certain subcontractors, engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law.   Reference: Provision:  52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement; Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br><br>Request responses to the following questions:<br><br>(1) Should a PLA be executed on selected large dollar contracts in the Omaha/Lincoln Metro area?<br>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<br>(7) What is the time impact of a PLA on a solicitation response?<br>(8) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in selected Omaha District Corps of Engineers contracts?<br><br><br>

DRAFT Statement of Work

1.	Scope

This statement of work (SOW) covers claims support services to fully develop the information and evidence needed to substantiate Veterans' claims for increased disability compensation benefits and deliver to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) claim packets ready for VA to make a decision.  Claims for increased disability that will be developed under this SOW are defined to include any Veteran's application for an increase in the compensation benefit paid for a disability already determined by VA to be service-connected, including claims for a resumption of payments previously discontinued.

Intake of Veterans' claims for increased compensation to be developed by the contractor shall include claims received at VA regional offices located throughout the nation.  

1.1	Background

VA's Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) administers the disability compensation benefit program, which provides a monetary benefit to Veterans who are disabled by injuries or illnesses that were incurred or aggravated during active military service.  These disabilities are considered to be "service-connected."  The amount of disability compensation payable varies with the degree of disability (if 30% or more disabled) and the number of dependents, and is paid monthly.  Veterans may file claims for increased compensation benefits at any time if their service-connected disabilities become progressively worse.  Veterans with certain severe disabilities may be eligible for additional special monthly compensation.  The benefits are not subject to federal or state income tax. 

Frequently, Veterans already receiving compensation will encounter deterioration of existing conditions that require re-evaluation for increased compensation.  Typically, this category of claims is among the least complex to develop, but nevertheless requires significant time and effort to develop complete packages of evidence in order to decide the claim.  Expedited development and claim package assembly by the contractor will reduce waiting times in communications between the Veteran, medical providers, and VA, facilitating timely compilation of fully developed packages that will be used for final evaluation of whether an increased evaluation is warranted.  The work described in this SOW contributes to VBA's mission by directly reducing the time and effort to fully develop claims and make them ready for decision.  

2.	Requirements

2.4	Period of Performance

The contract period of performance is TBD.

2.5	Hours of Contractor Operations 

The contractor, in compliance with Federal Regulations referenced in Section 5.1.4, shall determine work at the contractor site.   

If contractor personnel conduct any business at a VA site, the contractor shall maintain a work schedule that coincides with the schedule of VA.

3.	Deliverables

The contractor shall provide Monthly Status Reports including information as described in Sections 2.1.1.4 above.  The contractor shall provide all deliverables in formats as agreed to by the COTR or Contracting Officer.  Unless otherwise specified, all deliverables shall use Microsoft-Office-compatible formats.  Unless otherwise specified, project management deliverables such as project plans and schedules shall use Microsoft Project.  

4.	Performance Measures
Timeliness and accuracy are measured on a per-claim basis.
It is the Government's intention to incentivize the contractor based upon speed of delivery.  Conversely, the contractor will be monetarily penalized when quality or timeliness fall below contractual standards.

VA will assess the level of performance based on a 100% review of all claims packages received.   This review will be completed within 90 days of receipt of the fully developed claims package. 

4.1    Evaluation of Timeliness:
1)	Timeliness shall be measured on a per-claim basis using VA's tool - VETSNET Operations Reports (VOR).
2)	Time shall be measured in calendar days as:
Timeliness = Date fully developed claim package is submitted to the Government minus the date when established claim is received by contractor
3)	No early delivery incentive will be paid for any case found to have any errors.

4.2	  Evaluation of accuracy:
1)	Contractor accuracy shall be measured as a percentage fully developed claims packages with 0 errors.
2)	No incentive shall be paid for the month if the claims processed for that month do not meet or exceed 98% accuracy.  See Addendum A.	

For all claims pending with the contractor for > 90 days, details regarding status and issues must be presented in the monthly status report until resolved.  Development of claims must be continued at the contractor's development site.

For claims pending with the contractor for >120 days (after an initial report with summary has been submitted to VA at the 90 day timeframe) - the contractor is required to turn over the case back to the Government for development work along with all documentation and information collected thus far.  The contract shall be evaluated for non-performance by the COTR. 

The contractor must initiate contact with the Veteran on all claims within five business days of receipt of the claim. Claims where development has not been initiated within five business days must be presented in the monthly status report (along with reasons).

5.1.4	VA Information Custodial Requirements 

VA information provided to the contractor for either the performance or administration of this contract shall only be used for those purposes. No other use is permitted without the CO's express written authorization. This clause expressly limits the contractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d)(1).

Failure to complete this mandatory training within the timeframe required will be grounds for suspension or termination of all physical and/or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training is completed. 

5.1.7 Contractor Personnel Security/Background Investigation

All contract employees who require access to the VA site(s) and/or access to VA local area network (LAN) systems shall be the subject of a background investigation and must receive a favorable adjudication from the VA Security and Investigations Center (SIC). These requirements are applicable to all subcontractor personnel requiring the same NACI background investigation. 

The level of background security investigation will be in accordance with VA Directive 0710 dated September 10, 2004 and is available at http://www1.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=487&FType=2

The contract employee level of background investigation required for this effort is: NACI

5.1.8 Contractor Responsibilities

The contractor shall bear the expense of obtaining background investigations or reciprocals of previous investigations held that meet or exceed the required investigation level. The cost of the background investigations is as follows: Low Risk (NACI) $231, Moderate Risk (MBI) $825, High Risk (BI) $3,465 or Reciprocals $25. VA will pay for investigations or reciprocals processed through the VA SIC and conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in advance, however, the contractor shall reimburse the full cost of background investigations/reciprocals to VA within 30 days of Bill of Collections received from VA. VA shall send up to three plus one final delinquent notice to the contractor. If the contractor does not adhere to the Bill of Collections, future invoices may be subject to be offset by VA to recoup background investigation/reciprocal costs.

Immediately after contract or task order award, the contractor must submit the completed Attachment B form (VBA Contractor Background Investigation Request Worksheet) to the COTR to begin the background investigation process for all contract employees working on the contract, who will have access to VA facilities, VA systems, or privacy data.

The contractor and contractor point of contact (POC) will receive an email notification from SIC identifying the website link that includes detailed instructions regarding completion of the background clearance application process and what level of background was requested. Reminder notifications will be sent if the complete package is not submitted by the due date.

The contractor shall prescreen all personnel who require access to VA site(s) and/or access to VA LAN systems to ensure they maintain a U.S. citizenship or Alien Registration that authorizes them to work in the U.S. and are able to read, write, speak and understand the English language. 

Contractors who have a current favorable background investigation conducted by OPM or Defense Security Service (DSS) may be accepted through reciprocation. When a previous clearance is currently held, it does not preclude the vendor from submitting a completed Attachment B form to the COTR immediately after contract or task order award for all contract employees working on the contract.
  
Contractor shall not commence performance until the SIC confirms that it has received the contractor's investigative documents, that they are complete, and that the investigation information has been released to OPM for scheduling of the background investigation.   Once the contractor's background investigation has been released to OPM for scheduling of the background investigation or the SIC has confirmed that the verified investigation will be reciprocated, contract performance may commence.  The contractor, if notified of an unfavorable adjudication by the Government, shall withdraw the employee from consideration from working under the contract.  Failure to comply with the contractor personnel security requirements may result in termination of the contract for default. 

If the security clearance investigation is not completed prior to the start date of the contract, the contract employee may work on the contract with an initiated status while the security clearance is being processed. However, the contractor will be responsible for the actions of those contract and subcontract employees they provide to perform work for VA. In the event damage arises from work performed by contractor personnel, under the auspices of the contract, the contractor will be responsible for resources necessary to remedy the incident.

Should the contractor use a vendor other than OPM or DSS to conduct investigations, the investigative company must be certified by OPM/DSS to conduct contractor investigations. The Vendor Cage Code number must be provided to the VA SIC, which will verify the information and conclude whether access to the Government's site(s) and/or VA LAN systems can be.

The investigative history for contractor personnel working under this contract must be maintained in the databases of either OPM or the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO). 

Contractor shall allow VA personnel to visit and inspect contractor facility to review systems, processes and audit any and all documents and information related to the contract.

The contractor agrees to document Technology, Processes, or Process Improvements developed under this contract, and deliver the documentation to the VBA periodically or as requested.   The contractor agrees that VBA has unlimited rights to use and implement technology, and processes developed under this contract.   This includes, but is not limited to: computer software, forms, spreadsheets, process innovations, or other intellectual property developed to support claims processing.

After the COTR has received Attachment B form(s) from the contractor, SIC will send an e-mail notification to the contractor and their POC identifying the website link that includes detailed instructions regarding completion of the background clearance application process and what level of background was requested. SIC will also send reminder notifications to the contractor and their POC if the complete package is not submitted by the due date.

Upon receipt of required investigative documents, SIC will review the investigative documents for completion and initiate the background investigation by forwarding the investigative documents to OPM to conduct the background investigation. If the investigative documents are not complete, SIC will return the package to the contractor with corrective instructions.

VA will pay for investigations and reciprocals processed through the VA SIC and conducted by OPM in advance; however, the contractor shall reimburse the full cost of background investigations/reciprocals to VA within 30 days of Bills of Collection from VA. VA shall send up to three plus one final delinquent notice to the contractor. If the contractor does not adhere to the Bills of Collection, future invoices may be subject to be offset by VA to recoup background investigation costs and may be considered grounds for default.

The COTR will notify and forward the contractor a copy of the Certificate of Eligibility (form 4236) when the investigation has been favorably completed and adjudicated. The COTR will also notify the contractor of an unfavorable adjudication by the Government. 

5.2	Liquidated Damages

<DESC>The Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin has plans to repair the Lab Hood in the Pharmacy IV space at the Clement J Zablocki VA Medical Center.   

The project is for the construction of design modifications to the Oncology Lab hood room (a.k.a., Buffer Room) 4430B.  When construction is complete, the hoods in the room shall pass a certification test by the airflow certification agency, consisting of a smoke test at the hood sash/room interface, and a test of air flow velocities at 6 points along same interface to ensure they are within acceptable parameters of velocity and variability across the opening from left to right.  To date, various configurations of two hoods, one hood, different types of hoods, have all failed to pass the smoke test in particular, and were no better than marginal on the velocity array test.  

The contractor will be working in the vicinity of an occupied and operating hospital.  The contractor will be required to keep roads, walks and entrances to grounds, parking, and to occupied areas of buildings clear of construction materials, debris and standing construction equipment and vehicles.  Submittals regarding staging of equipment, crane placement, storage of supplies, etc. are required.

<DESC>This contract&nbsp;for a follow-on effort to the Lightweight Ceramic Armor Program to continue development and scale-up of the Plasma Pressure Compaction (P2C) ceramic consolidation technology and testing of ceramic-based body armor systems produced using this unconventional ceramic processing technique. The contractor&nbsp;will&nbsp;further develop and demonstrate a unique procedure for producing high-density, curved ceramic plates up to 7" x 8" in size. The high-performance ceramic tiles will be integrated into a proprietary hybrid composite armor system and will be tested to meet Army ballistic specifications. The contractor will be required to demonstrate a consistent ceramic consolidation process featuring reduced time and temperature in comparison to conventional consolidation approaches. This scaled P2C system will allow for consolidation of both nano- and submicron-sized powders. <br /><br />

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) awarded this effort&nbsp;under N00383-06-D-001J, via bilateral modification with The Boeing Company. The requirement is to increase the current Hornet Support Network support to include Expeditionary Field Service Representatives (FSRs) in support of the E/A-18G Growler aircraft stationed overseas. The contractor will be required to provide one FSR team consisting of one each; Airborne Electronic Attack Rep; AESA Radar Rep; E/F/G Air Vehicle Rep; and an E/F/G Avionics Rep. It is anticipated that the period of performance will be eight months, including a six month deployment. This award is based on Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), whereby the supplies or services required are available from only one source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Boeing Company is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer, and supplier of the F/A-18G Growler aircraft and is uniquely qualified to provide the complete range of program support required by the Fleet. The Boeing Company is the only known firm that possesses the technical data, resources, and expertise necessary to fulfill the Government's requirements.

This is scheduled for May 2011. Due to it remote location VAAF has no manned, on site weather forecasting and observation servicers. This is accomplished solely with the AWOS augmented with a radio transmitter. The replacement AWOS, just as the legacy AWOS, doesnit come with transmit capability. This is our responsibility to purchase. It is of the utmost importance and directly related to the Life, Health and Safety of all crewmembers and passengers that fly within VAAF?s airspace that this new AWOS has transmit capability.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 6.303-1

(1)    AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:  

U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs
Center Acquisition Innovation (CAI-DC)
1776 I Street NW
Washington, DC 20420

(2)  	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED:

A sole source requirement for the Department of Veterans Affairs with the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) for a Nuclear Medicine Imaging Proficiency Testing Program.  

(3)  	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:

The nature of the action is to meet the requirements of the Clinical Laboratory Act (CLIA) of 1989.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has had an ongoing relationship with the SNM as a sole source vendor of a nuclear medicine imaging proficiency testing program.  The imaging proficiency program is employed throughout VA's imaging entities and those external medical facilities that provide nuclear imaging services to VA patients via bona fide agreements.  For this program, imaging proficiency is assessed by means of an "imaging phantom."  A phantom may be defined as a specially designed simulator that is imaged to evaluate and analyze the performance of a nuclear medicine imaging device.  The phantom used to evaluate a nuclear medicine imaging device should appear similar to human tissues and organ.  The purpose of the program is to evaluate the adequacy of the technologic capability of the gamma cameras employed, the skill of the technical staff performing the imaging procedure and the expertise of the physician who interprets the nuclear scan and renders an impression. 

The period of performance will consist of a base period of twelve (12) months and four (4) twelve (12) month option periods. 

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  

FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) -- The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies and services available from only one source 

(5)	A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED.  

The specific service that limit the availability to a sole source.  There are companies that manufacture and sale phantoms but only SNM provides the reading, interpretation of results and tracking that is necessary to meet the requirements.  

The Society for Nuclear Medicine (SNM) is the professional association for Nuclear Medicine physicians and technologists.  These unique services are only available through the SNM.  The SNM performs same services to private facilities including other medical facilities and medical teaching facilities. They have 25 years experience in Nuclear Medicine proficiency testing methods (phantoms) and the administration of CME for physicians. A review of phantom-producing companies offer phantoms for equipment only, these companies do not provide acceptance testing, no continuing medical education (CME) offered, no practitioner QA evaluation. SNM provides written results of imaging performance by nuclear medicine laboratory to each participating and written results of physician-specific performance to each participating nuclear physician.  An overall report "Subscriber Performance Review" providing both detailed facility results and summary information will be sent to National Headquarters, Office of the Program Director, Nuclear Medicine and Radiation Safety Service, Diagnostic Services, Patient Care Services. This will include a comparison (if applicable) of the VA's results with the private sector facilities that participated in the particular exercise. 

(6)  	A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLICIZED IN FEDBIZOPPS AS REQUIRED BY FAR Subpart 5.2, AND IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER FAR 5.202  APPLIES. 

A review of companies that manufacturer phantoms lead to the determination that these phantom manufacturers do not provide a nuclear medicine imaging proficiency testing program.  The SNM is the only known company through VA's Nuclear Medicine Program who can provide such services.  SNM is the only known company who also provides these same services to other medical facilities and teaching facilities. 

J&A will be posted to FBO after award.

(7)  	DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ANTICIPATED COST WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION:

This determination will be based on a comparison of the vendor's proposed price to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE), market research, and appropriate price analysis techniques.

The Contracting Officer also reviewed the prior pricing structure for the same services offered in previous contracts to SNM for the same services.  The pricing for the Phantom can be compared to published price lists for similar items and the pricing for services can be compared to commercial price lists for testing and/or quality assurance rates. Based on the market research, IGCE and price analysis, the Contracting Officer anticipates the cost of this procurement to be fair and reasonable.

 
(8)  	A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: 

The first RFI (#VA24410RI0356) was conducted by VHA on 8-20-2010. Responses were due 8-30-2010. No responses were received. This information was posted on FedBizOpps. The RFI remained posted 30 days after the response date.

On 8/20/2010, the second RFI (#VA24410RI0357) was posted on FedBizOpps for the purpose of identifying potential qualified contractors. Responses were due August 30, 2010. We received interest from the following vendors: DCS, INPUT, and Data Dynamics. Each of the contractors did not fully demonstrate qualifications for the requirement. The company INPUT was only interested in tracking opportunities. The RFI remained posted 30 days after the response date.  No additional responses received. 

The VACO contracting office requested capability statements from the vendors. Capability statements were due on 11/15/2010. Capability statements were reviewed. None qualified.

To confirm whether or not this is a sole source requirement, market research (see attached Market Research) was conducted by the contract specialist.  Four phantom-producing companies were reviewed. They were Universal Medical Incorporated, Supertech X-ray (WOSB), Pacific Northwest X-ray, Inc. and Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM).  SNM was the only company that fully satisfied the requirement.  Neither of the remaining companies could offer continuing medical education (CME) nor quality assurance (QA) medical evaluation. Past performance was also lacking. 

On 12/9/2010, this requirement changed to a sole source procurement with the incumbent SNM. On 12/29/2010, the VACO contracting office posted a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to SNM. The notice was posted under Sources Sought Notice number VA-101-11-RP-0015. Responses were due 1/5/2011. One inquiry received, but no solicitation requested. The notice was posted on FedBizOpps and remained posted 30 days after the response date. No capability statements were received.  

The market research revealed that while other sources may have the general technical capabilities to perform similar type of work, only SNM as the incumbent has the technical knowledge, qualifications, experience and past performance necessary to satisfy VA's aforementioned requirements. In particular, the companies lacked continuing medical education (CME) and practitioner quality assurance (QA) evaluation. 

An internet search of Nuclear Medicine Imaging Testing companies also resulted in only one source, the Society of Nuclear Medicine.

 (9)	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Since 2004, the incumbent Society of Nuclear Medicine has been fully performing VHA required services in an outstanding manner.  The program management office (PMO) proposes to enter into another sole source contract with the incumbent Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) for the mandated Imaging Proficiency Testing program. Furthermore, SNM prices are fair and reasonable and well below the current market rate based on the market research for companies capable of offering similar but less phantom medical services. 

The Contracting Officer, based on information from Central Contractor Registration Data, Online Representations and Certifications Application and Excluded Parties List System, has determined that Society of Nuclear Medicine meets the standards for responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.1.

The anticipated performance period will be a base period of twelve (12) months with four (4) twelve (12) month option periods from the date of award.

(10)  A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION.

Sigma-K Corporation expressed interest for future solicitations. 

(11)	A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED.

Due to the nature of this procurement action, no future competitive plans are contemplated.

(12) Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

DEPARTMENTOF VETERANSAFFAIRS

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295
This is a "Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition."  The purchase request 2237 transaction number is 556-11-2-2450-0016.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:   

The Federal Health Care Center (FHCC) has a requirement for CRNA services 40 hours per week Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. or 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (the tour of duty is negotiable).  Plus take call every 5th weekend from Friday at 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Monday and also provide up to 5 days of weekday night call per month from the hours of 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.  On Call Surgical Services has satisfactorily provided these services to the FHCC under contract number VA69D-P-0869 from February 15, 2009 through February, 28, 2011.


3. Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: 

It is recommended to award a firm fixed price follow on contract to On Call Surgical Services for the period of 5/1, through 9/30/2011 with one 6 month option to extend services.  The estimated value for 5/1, through 9/30/2011 is $210,000.  The estimated value for 6 month option period is $210,000.  The total value with option is $420,000.

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 

The VA's statutory authority to make sole-source awards to SDVOSBs is set forth at 38 U.S.C. sect. 8127, Pub. L. No. 109-461, 120 Stat. 3431, 3432 (2006).  This authority allows the VA to award to an SDVOSB on a sole-source basis when:

(1) such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;
(2) the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and
(3) in the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.

5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): 

Currently the FHCC has four operation rooms and only 3.7 FTEE anesthesia staff.  Anesthesia is responsible for covering all surgical cases, ECT procedures, Cardiology procedures, Pulmonary procedures and GI procedures. The FHCC has requested to hire two Anesthesiologists/CRNAs however these requests have not been approved.  

This contract is required to maintain essential and continued anesthesia coverage at the FHCC, North Chicago, IL  This coverage consists of 24/7 anesthesia coverage and is critical to direct patient care.  

On Call Surgical Services is a SDVOSB who has provided exemplary services on contract VA69D-P-0869 from February 15, 2009 through February 28, 2011.

6. Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: 

A Sources Sought was completed which produced one not verified SDVOSB.  The SDVOSB contacted contracting officer by phone in response to the sources sought expressing interest.  However the sources sought specified a response in writing which was reiterated to the SDVOSB.  No written response received.


7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:

The prior contract was awarded to this SDVOSB and determined to be fair and reasonable based on FSS contractor rates.


8. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: 

A sources sought was conducted with one not verified SDVOSB response.


9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Previous recruitment has been lengthy and unsuccessful as this requirement has been identified as a shortage category and difficult to fill.  An Open and Continuous vacancy announcement will be open until the requirement is filled.  This is a critical requirement than cannot be left open during a period of recruitment due to direct patient care needs.  Use of contract staff will be utilized until permanent staff can be obtained.  


10. Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:   


Three FSS contractors are as follows:
Harris Medical Associates, LLC
Staff Care Inc.
Jackson & Coker, LLC

One SBA-certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business SBA-certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business:
Choctaw Enterprises


11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: 

None


12. Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
