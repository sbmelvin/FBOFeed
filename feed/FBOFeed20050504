<DESC>Western Area Power Administration requires a Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract for Light Duty Transmission Line Steel Pole  Structures (Class 2 Equivalent), for its Corporate Service Office (CSO)  located in Lakewood, Colorado; the Rocky Mountain Customer Service Office  (RMR) located in Loveland, Colorado; The Upper Great Plains Customer  Service Office (UGP) with the office located in Huron, South Dakota; and  the Desert Southwest Customer Service  Office (DSR) located in Phoenix,  Arizona.  Delivery of poles may be to the following states:  Arizona,  California, Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New  Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.  Contract will be  awarded for a five year period.  The Government intends to utilize the  procedures in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12 (Acquisition of  Commercial Items) and Part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation) to award using  a best value determination procedure. Estimated contract value is between  $1,000,000 and $2,500,000. Estimated award date is on or about July 1,  2005.  Individual delivery orders will be issued against the contract. The  acquisition is full and open competition.  The North American Industrial  Classification System Code is 331221 and the size standard is 1000  employees. All responsible business sources may submit a proposal which  shall be considered by the agency. The full solicitation 138 pages in pdf  and zip is attached to this announcement. Offerors will be evaluated in accordance with the following process and  criteria:  (1) AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without  discussions with offerors.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain  the offerorâ€™s best terms from a price standpoint.  However, the Government  reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined necessary by  the Contracting Officer. (2) BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD (a) Performance Price Trade-Off (PPT): This acquisition will utilize the PPT technique to make a best value award  decision.  Past Performance is equal to price.  Price and past performance  may be traded off, one against the other, as addressed in paragraph (ii)  below.  The application of the PPT technique in contract award and  selection and approval process is as follows: (i) All offerors will receive a performance risk assessment rating of High  Confidence, Significant Confidence, Confidence, Unknown Confidence, Little  Confidence, or No Confidence. (ii)  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than  the lowest evaluated price offeror or to a higher priced offeror with a  better performance risk rating.  The Contracting Officer shall make an  assessment of the price proposed and the performance risk rating assigned  to determine the best value for the Government. (b)  Past Performance Risk Assessment: (i)     Performance risk will be evaluated in accordance with FAR  15.305(a)(2).  Performance risk is assessed based on recency, relevancy  and quality of performance.  A relevance determination is made based upon  whether an offerorâ€™s performance is relevant to this acquisition in terms  of work, size and complexity.  Past Performance information is not limited  to just that of the offeror.  It may also include predecessor companies,  key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will  perform major or critical aspects of the requirements.  In assessing  performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including:  (a) reviewing the experience listed in the proposal, (b) evaluating the  offerorsâ€™ success in meeting small business subcontracting goals, (c)  seeking additional present and past performance information through the  use of simplified questionnaires, and (d) using data independently  obtained from other government and commercial sources. (ii) The purpose will be to identify and review the recency, relevancy and  quality of the offerorâ€™s work present and past performance, and then make  an overall risk assessment of the offerorâ€™s ability to perform this  effort.  The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating as defined  below.  This risk assessment represents the evaluation teamâ€™s analysis of  the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed  effort based on the itâ€™s demonstrated present and past performance. Rating                                                  Definition Exceptional/High Confidence     Based on the offerorâ€™s performance record  essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the  required effort. Very Good/Significant Confidence        Based on the offerorâ€™s performance  record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the  required effort. Satisfactory/Confidence Based on the offerorâ€™s performance record, some  doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required  effort. Neutral/Unknown Confidence      No performance record identifiable. Marginal/Little Confidence      Based on the offerorâ€™s performance record,  substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the  required effort.  Changes to the offerorâ€™s existing processes may be  necessary in order to achieve contract requirements. Unsatisfactory/No Confidence    Based on the offerorâ€™s performance record,  extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the  required effort. (c)  The following documents will be evaluated for responsiveness,  completeness and compliance with requirements of the RFP.  Incomplete  items may be a basis for rejection. â€¢       A signed copy of the solicitation contract award document, SF  1449. â€¢       Completed bid schedule, Section B. â€¢       Acknowledgment of all amendments, SF 30(s). â€¢       Completed Representation and Certifications, FAR 52.212-3. â€¢       Applicable fill in provisions completed  â€¢       Past Performance Questionnaires and applicable attachments, FAR  52.212-2 (d) Pre-Award Survey of Prospective Contractors: If your response to this  solicitation is favorably considered, a survey team may contact your  facility to determine your ability to perform.  Current financial  statements and other pertinent data should be available for Government  review at that time if not already on file with the office having  cognizance over your facility.  Examples of these areas that may be  investigated and evaluated are listed below: (1)     Technical Capability (2)     Production Capability (3)     Plant Facilities and Equipment (4)     Financial Responsibility (5)     Purchases and Subcontracting (6)     Accounting Systems (7)     Quality Assurance (8)     Transportation (9)     Plant Security (10)  Security Clearance (11)  Labor Resources (12)  Performance Record (13)  Ability to Meet Delivery Schedules (14)  Other as Appropriate Offerors are advised that accomplishment of this survey is a part of the  evaluation process and is not to be construed as an indication that an  Offeror will receive or is in the best position to receive the award. PAST PERFORMANCE:  Past performance shall provide adequate information describing the  offerorâ€™s previous experience in manufacturing and providing light duty  steel structures, or work of a similar complexity and magnitude, both  commercial and government that are ongoing or were completed in the last  three years.  The offeror shall also list all contracts having a similar  complexity and magnitude (maximum of last ten consecutive contracts)  performed within the past three years.  If the offeror has not performed  ten contracts within the past three years having the same complexity or  magnitude as required for this solicitation then please list whatever  contracts performed (maximum of ten contracts).  In addition, past  performance information on contracts not listed by the offeror may be  solicited by the Government.  If an offeror does not have any past  performance information to submit as the entity under which the proposal  is being submitted, then the offeror should submit past performance data  identified above under which the offerorâ€™s key personnel have worked.  The  offeror should provide all information regarding the past performance  efforts applicable to predecessor companies.  If the offeror claims there  is no past performance, then that status must be identified to the  Contracting Officer no later than the date and time due for past  performance proposals from all offerors. (1)  Provide a summary of the previous contracts described above.  Include  information on subcontractors whose effort on this acquisition is  projected to be more than 25% of the effort.  The summary must include: (a)     Name of project (contract number, if applicable) (b)     Name and address of customer or government agency (c)     Name and telephone number of customer contact or contracting  officer (d)     Dollar value and period of performance (e)     Description of work performed (2)     Provide statements, letters, reports, or evaluations from prior  customers indicating the level and quality of past performance on the  above contracts. EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS (1) Initial Evaluation of Proposals - The following steps will occur as  part of the initial evaluation: (a) Offer and Other Documents Reviewed: All documents will be evaluated to  ensure compliance with the solicitation requirements and the offeror's  eligibility for award. Award will only be made to a responsive,  responsible firm.  Questions relating to eligibility due to partnerships,  teaming arrangements, joint ventures, etc., will be referred to the Legal  Advisor or Small Business Administration representative as appropriate. (b) Past Performance Initial Assessment: The ten (10) references provided  by each offeror will be reviewed to identify those most representative of  the requirements.  Five (5) additional references will be required for any  major subcontractors, partners, or joint venture participants.  All  references will be assessed as "highly" representative, "moderately"  representative or "barely" representative. (c) Pricing Data Calculated: Price proposals will be evaluated to  determine the accuracy and reasonableness of the proposed price and the  calculated price to the Government.  Price proposals will be compared to  the Government's cost estimate as one measure of reasonableness. (d) Technical Compliance: Each offer will be reviewed to ensure that all  elements of the specifications have been addressed. (e) Initial Recommendation and Decision: The results of the initial  evaluation will be recorded and presented to the Contracting Officer for a  source selection decision. Offerors not selected will be notified of the  reason for their exclusion.

<DESC>The Contractor shall assess near-term technological capabilities to provide a low cost Associate Intermodal Platform (AIP).  The AIP will improve the Department of Defense (DOD) distribution mission and minimize throughput concerns.  The assessment and end product will provide a proof of concept for the AIP.  Inefficiencies identified in 463L asset recovery in contingency operations will be examined in order to determine if they can be eliminated with AIP.  The AIP, with cargo intact, moves forward into the theater while 463L pallets and nets remain in the Defense Transportation System (DTS) under this study.  It provides potential for expansion to all contingency and exercise operations in all theaters.  Supported Combatant Commanders will be able to determine if substantial benefit will be realized through the 463L AIP by eliminating the need to provide theater management oversight, force protection for recovery teams, and increased inventory for air cargo flow.  United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)/Air Mobility Command (AMC) will be able to determine if substantial benefit will be realized through assured availability of 463L pallets and reduction in cargo handling processes.  This study will also examine means to reduce the manpower-intensive efforts to recover, inspect, and clean 463L assets.  In coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency and AMC, this effort will develop a Concept of Operations for a pilot demonstration of the AIP capability in the DTS.

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Impediments to full and open competition which exist are due to the following conditions: 

A.	Lack of required data.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a delivery order or contract modification for the effort required for the Range Safety System Test Set (RSSTS) Test Equipment (TE) Obsolescence Upgrades.

Since 1994, RCS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tactical Tomahawk missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to perform this effort, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing these requirements in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>General Information For the past 45 years, NASA’s technology achievements have extended the breadth and range of scientific exploration in many fields of endeavor.  NASA has been issued over 6,300 patents; nearly one in a thousand of all patents ever issued by the U.S. Patent Office (since 1790). NASA’s programs have also resulted in at least 1400 commercial products, which have benefited the nation’s economy.  Thousands of lives have been saved through NASA’s programs, e.g. search and rescue, or the quality of life of individuals has been significantly improved (e.g. cool suits).  NASA’s recent innovations embrace over 100 fields of exploration.	Our support for new computer languages and operating systems has enabled advances in computer science.  Our needs for wireless communications have resulted in advances in telecommunications.  Our requirements for surviving space environments and violent atmospheres on faraway worlds as well as reentry to Earth have led to new materials and processes for manufacturing. Measuring (quantitatively and qualitatively) the positive impacts of these achievements is difficult; the agency wants neither to overstate nor understate their value.  Methods to assess the value are often problematic; for example some of the products themselves enabled the development of other products, or conversely NASA’s support or the market penetration of a product may have been of marginal benefit. Structure of Submitted Responses This RFI seeks comments on (a) NASA Spinoffs and (b) NASA Inventions and Contributions. Methods to best measure, analyze and report on the tangible impacts of other programs (e.g. aeronautics; space exploration; earth science; space operations) may be included, but these are not the focus of the requested response. All responses shall be delivered in an electronic format using Microsoft Word.	  Supplemental information may be provided in a narrative format using Microsoft Word with graphics, as appropriate. Font size should be no smaller than 12 point in Times New Roman. The total response should be no more than 3 pages in length including supporting graphics and additional backup material. Input should include the following as a minimum:  For submitted responses, include: •	Submitter name, phone, email, and mail address •	Inputs and suggestions as to how best to inventory, measure and report on the tangible impacts of its technological (hardware, software) achievements, for example:    1.	Economic analysis, market creation, market penetration   2.	Lives saved   3.	Health and quality of life   4.	Educational    5.	Other (defined by respondent) Key words that serve to identify important elements of the input should be highlighted for quick visibility. No Proprietary Concepts NASA reserves the right to use submitted responses for NASA internal planning and analysis concept development activities. Although details of responses are meant only for NASA use, response submitters should not submit proprietary material. Future Use of Responses This RFI is for information and planning purposes.  No procurement is planned as a direct result of this Request for Information. This is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Parties proposing concepts of interest may be invited to submit more detailed information or to discuss their concepts further. No solicitation exists, therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  Failure to respond to this RFI does not mean that a firm cannot respond to a solicitation at a later date.

The following salient characteristics apply: 1) Ability to scan standard microscope slides bearing in-house printed microarrays or commercial microarrays from NimbleGen Biosystems, with non-confocal technology, 2) Ability to accurately and reproducibly scan at 10 micro or 5 micro resolution, to accommodate the above mentioned arrays’ format, 3) ability to scan two channels (laser excitation wavelengths of 532 and 635 nm), 4) High dynamic range of detection, 5) ability to acquire and save single or double-wavelength images of the array for analysis on NCI web-based software, 6) Must fit in a small footprint, not to exceed 16" Wide,  24" Long and 24" High, 7) Must come with software to run scanner, 8) Scanner software must enable on-the-fly feature visualization and histogram generation, for PMT optimization during scanning, and an option for automated PMT gain setting, 9) Machine software must be able to export color images in 24-bit JPEG format for analysis on NCI web-based software, 10)  Microarray analysis software must be able to recognize features that are circular, square or irregular, with some flexibility for imperfect spotting, and to align the spots in terms of row, column and block, 11)  Software must be able to import GAL files that identify the genes represented in all features, 12)  Microarray analysis software must have user-defined manual as well as automatic flagging features for quality control and normalization and, 13) Microarray analysis software must have ability to visualize background pixels and to perform multiple methods of background subtraction. Justification: The Axon Genepix 4000B microarray scanner is required for the use of the NimbleGen arrays, which are being used in current studies, are very specialized in that the size of the oligonucleotide features (5 microns) on their microarrays is so small that only certain scanners have the resolution to allow acceptable imaging and quantification of the signals produced.  The Axon Genepix 4000B microarray scanner is the most compatible scanner in using the NimbleGen microarrays. The existing scanner that NimbleGen scientists are currently using in their in-house microarray service core is the Axon Genepix 4000B. Changing the scanner for future microarrays will change the variables and will interrupt correct interpretation of the studies being currently performed.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Manufaturing Engineering Services (MES) for the conversion of the 14A12 Anti Surface Warfare (ASW) Team Trainer to PC-based consoles and displays to allow for future GRTS incorporation at Fleet ASW School, San Diego, CA.  This sole source award is based on FAR Part 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Anticipated award date is end of June 2005.

This sole source award is based on the following factors:

1.  Budget Risk:  The available funds are limited and will not allow for learning curve costs.  The award must be in a FFP vehicle, any other vendor must accept type of contract.
2.  Schedule Risk:  The time frame of the FFP vehicle is limited as result of bullet #1.  Due to the desire to make these enhancements in the shortest time possible, the original contractor has the most intimate knowledge and personnel assets to achieve this goal. 
3.  Interoperability Risk:  MES’s familiarity with the interface requirements after completing the TDSS Integration affords the government the best value in this situation.  Unless a vendor possesses a similar experience with interface of the existing applications, can perform the upgrades, these requirements will incur cost that will exceed the available budget.
4.  Subject Matter Expertise.  MES has conducted similar efforts on the 14A12J for Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) and have an established and approved lab for safe use and storage of classified code. In turn MES possesses ISD specialists and subject matter experts that are already familiar with this system and the requirements of the customer, reducing confusion and saving time.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information and technical capability statement in response to this notice. Navair Orlando Contracts shall consider all responses. Proprietary data in the responses will be protected where so designated.  Any questions about this notice, please contact Jun Ji, Code 25334 at 407-380-4020 or jun.ji@navy.mil
All other contractors interested in subcontracting opportunities must contact MES directly.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Item: Drilling System, Well, Rotary, Truck Mounted. NSN: 3820-01-246-4276. Quantity: 11. FOB Origin. The offer date is on or about 20 June 2005. Method of Acquisition: Sole Source. This action is to award a Contract for the Service Life Extension Pro gram (SLEP)and the Army RESET Program for the Drilling System, Well, Rotary, Truck Mounted, Air Transportable, 600 Ft. Capacity, Model LP-12, NSN 3820-01-246-4276.  The action for the SLEP Program will take 3 Army LP-12s and make them to a like new conditi on.  The Contractor will also be required to keep as much logistics commonality with the original LP-12 rather than trying to modernize or upgrading the Well Drilling Rigs.  There is a Support Truck as part of the Well Drilling Rig.  This action will only cover the SLEPing of the Well Drilling Rig.  This effort will include the  requirement to RESET 8 each, Drilling System, Well, Rotary, Truck Mounted, Air Transportable, 600 Ft. Capacity, Model LP-12; this includes the Support Truck.  The Army RESET Program  requires a 60 day turn-around from the date of the contract or delivery order.  Because the vehicles repaired under RESET may likely be re-deployed in the near future, the expediency of this effort is critical to the success of the Global War on Terrorism . HQDA Operational Order (OPORD) 04-01, dated 24 Nov 03, cites the necessity for the Army to RESET/Reconstitute units to meet global commitments and contingencies. The requirement is to have units returned to ready to fight status within 120 days of return  of their equipment to home stations.  The system must be repaired to conform to the operational requirements/standards of Technical Manual (TM) -10 and -20 series Preventive Maintenance Checks and Services of TM 5-3820-256-10.  This action is planned on a  sole source basis to George Failing Company, GEFCO.  TACOM proposes to award a Firm Fixed Price 5-year Long Term Contract for this action.  Other interested parties must be able to adequately demonstrate the ability to perform the required work.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to publish the Request for Information (RFI) from an interested bidder and the Government responses. QUESTIONS FROM THE BIDDER: 1. During our visit to the above referenced site, we observed various items of furniture, to include cloth covered chairs, cloth-covered partitians, desks, etc.  What is to be done with these items?  We see no mention of these items to be removed and disposed of or cleaned included in the bid. 2. With reference to reconstruction in the bathroom, do you require green board instead of regular dry wall?  The green board is not specified in the bid documents. 3. We did not see an entry point to the attic (no steps).  We assume that the front ceiling grids must come out to create access to install the boards in the attic.  Is that correct? 4. We observed approximately 5' of wall past the window in the first room.  This is not addressed in the bid documents.  Should this 5' of wall also be removed? RESPONSES FROM THE GOVERNMENT: 1. Furniture will be removed from the building by the Refuge Staff. 2. Water resistant (green Board) is required on the plumbing wall. 3. There is no attic access except through the suspended ceiling.  This ceiling gives access throughout the building.  Recommend removing portions of the ceiling grid in the Multi-Purpose Room to gain attac access.   The reflected ceiling plan on drawing sheet A-2 shows ceiling tiles to be removed for this purpose.  If necessary, the Contractor may remove any additional tiles and grid.  However, the tiles and grid components must be protected. 4. A general note on drawing sheet A-1 states that if more mold damage is found that is not covered in the contract documents, the Contractor is to notify the Contracting Officer  for adjustment (in accordance with contract terms). As a result of this announcement, the Bid Due Date and Time remains the same at May 10, 2005 at 2:00 pm.

Nature of Amendment 05:   This amendment announces posting of the  Government's responses to Business and Industries' questions and comments on  the Revised Draft RFP, dated 22 Apr 2005.  As a result of additional industry  questions and comments, the formal RFP contains minor revisions.  However,  most of the changes were already captured in the significantly revised draft  dated 22 April 2005.  We will not be posting a second revised draft RFP.  The  previously posted revised draft RFP, 22 Apr 005, remains in the Document  Library at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil under the Business Opportunity  entitled "CAPS_A+AS_STEP03-Consolidated acquisition of Profess...". 3.  For your planning purposes, the Formal RFP is anticipated to be posted  within the next ten (10) days (i.e. 04 thru 14 May2005).  It is unlikely that  there will be time to publish the exact RFP posting date prior to the actual  posting.

The first year quantity is estimated at 44 each.  Contract will have 4 Option periods that can be exercised unilaterally by the government. Approximately 48 additional tanks may be acquired using options.  Delivery destinations are varied, with many in overseas locations.  Anticipated award date is Aug 2005.  First delivery will be due NLT 90 days ARO. This activity will acquire the collapsible bladders using Other Than Full and Open Competition (OTF&OC) procedures:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One or a Limited Number of Responsible Sources, and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements Source(s):  American Fuel Cell & Coated Fabrics (AMFUEL)  601 Firestone Dr  Magnolia, AR 71753-0887  (CAGE:  005476) This contractor is the only source available who has the required technical drawings and specifications to meet the needs of the Air Force.  There is incomplete, reprocurable data available for these fuel bladders, it cannot be competed.   These fuel bladders are designed specifically for military use with the C-130 ABFDS system.  They are not commercial items and the government does not have the rights to the drawings nor is it capable of acquiring those rights.  This is a USAF requirement, but foreign military services may receive shipments under the resultant contract.  Option BEQ’s will be listed in the resultant RFP. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>Amendment Number One is issued to provide additional description of the services required and to add Note 22 to the synopsis.  The Department of Homeland Security intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis with Institute for Physical Sciences, Inc., 1365 Beverly Road, Suite 300 McLean, VA  22102 to develop a novel technical capability to expolit extensive, unanalyzed open-source material with a state-of-the-art technical approach that meets the high-priority needs of the US communities combating terrorism at the federal, state, and local levels.  This approach shall employ measures and techniques derived from dynamical network analysis to discern the interests, intentions, and capacities of specific groups that threaten the US.  The goal is to develop a tool to supplement traditional analytic methods, giving the intelligence community the ability to obtain massive human network data on relevant groups automatically.  This approach shall provide the innovative technical means to monitor, analyze, and exploit foreign elities, financiers, operatives, recruiters, technicians, and ideologues through open source and classified holdings.

Background Information
The Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) provides general executive assistance and direction, policy development, administrative management direction and oversight, operational support and liaison services for the 94 United States Attorneys' Offices (USAOs). As part of this mission, EOUSA provides information technology services to the USAOs. Detailed information regarding the mission and functions of the EOUSA can be found on the Internet at http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/index.html.

The Enterprise Case Management System (ECMS) will replace the multiple instances of LIONS with a single, centralized web system. ECMS will operate over the wide area network connecting EOUSA and all USAOs.
Significant requirements analysis and design work has been conducted on the LIONS to ECMS conversion. Some prototyping code for ECMS has been developed.
Note: After receipt and review of the information obtained through this RFI, EOUSA intends to establish a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to complete the ECMS design, system development, and deployment to all 94 USAOs. EOUSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information provided.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV requires an Atmospheric Pressure/Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (AP/MALDI) Source for Waters/Micromass QTOF-II Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer for the NIOSH/HELD/Allergy and Clinical Immunology Branch.

Mass Tech, Inc. is the only vendor worldwide that produces an atmospheric pressure/matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (AP/MALDI) ion source for the Waters/Micromass QTOF-II instrument (SN:UC153) located in the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Branch.  Waters/Micromass does not produce an AP/MALDI source for this instrument 

AP/MALDI is an important and recognized technique for biomolecular analysis.  By coupling an AP/MALDI source to our existing QTOF-II instrument we can interrogate biomolecules with much more sensitivity, mass accuracy, and resolution than by any existing instrumentation.  The AP/MALDI source is necessary equipment for the advancement of several ongoing research projects in the Branch, including tuberculosis profiling and antigen identification and toxic mold research.

This notice is issued for informational purposes only.  Any interested party may identify themselves to the contracting officer no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Submit information to Rebecca Mullenax, MS 1019, Reference:  000HCC36-2005-21313, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less then $100,000.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources exist, therefore, no solicitation will be issued.  If no responses are received within 15 days, award will be made to MassTech, Inc.  Award will be made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(C)(1) without further notices being issued.  All responses received shall be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is currently undergoing significant upgrades to provide new and improved capabilities to the warfighter & civil user communities that include earth coverage Military-Code (M-Code), anti-jam spot beam providing signal power increases, auto navigation (autonav), higher accuracy than the current system, near real time response to misleading signals from GPS space vehicles (SVs), and additional civil signals.  To that end, the GPS Joint Program Office (JPO) is soliciting proposals for various studies, capabilities, and demonstrations to increase the Air Force's understanding and capabilities in the area of satellite control segment architectures.  The Air Force desires a satellite control architecture that is modular, adaptable, and extensible to operate up to 63 satellites.  Innovative and low risk approaches are being sought for satellite control segment software architectures that provide major mission functions and commonality in user interface to the satellite operator.  Satellite operations mission areas that should be addressed include:  1) Telemetry, Tracking & Commanding (TT&C), 2) Navigation (NAV) Mission, and 3) Mission Planning (MP).  Funding of multiple contractors is anticipated, depending on the merits of the contractor proposals and the availability of funding. CONTRACT OBJECTIVES:  See Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) attached. Prospective contractors should submit a statement of capabilities in writing no later than 11 May 2005 with documented evidence of their capability to meet all technical contractual requirements.  Contractors who previously submitted their statement of capabilities for the 18 February 2005 Control Segment Request For Information (RFI) (Ref. #GPS-CS-28) do not need to submit this statement again. The purpose of this announcement is to help the government identify interested potential offerors, or teams, capable of achieving the program objectives within acceptable risks and costs.  The capability package should provide a synopsis of relevant capabilities and past experience with the following information:  1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact, job titles, telephone numbers and email addresses, 2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other, 3) Experience in satellite control segment technologies, and 4) The facilities to work at the appropriate security level.  Interested offerors must submit Statements of Capabilities (SOC) that clearly show that they are qualified to perform this effort.  Responses should also indicate the source's intent to be either a prime contractor or subcontractor.  All responses are to be unclassified and should not exceed five (5) one-sided pages. Respondents interested in being a subcontractor should not exceed two (2) one-sided pages and should briefly identify relevant experience and expertise.  Small Business Offerors are encouraged as one award may be set aside for small business depending on small business response and capabilities; note that small business size standard NAICS 541710 (1,000 employees) applies.  Responses must be submitted by email in electronic form in MS Word or PDF format to victor.deal@losangeles.af.mil with a follow-up signature hard copy of the submission to SMC/GPK, Attn: Carol Laechelt, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1866, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659. All responses must conform to 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  If respondents wish to include proprietary data, they must adhere to DFAR 227.7103-10 Contractor Identification and Marking of Technical Data to be Furnished with Restrictive Markings. This synopsis is for planning purposes only; any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. Additional questions to the Government may be included under separate cover; the government reserves the right to not respond to all questions but will make an effort to respond to questions.  All questions will be considered in future program planning efforts. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this Notice of Contract, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request. The government intends to post draft and planning documents in the GPS Bidders Library as they become available to allow industry to view.  Parties need to register with the GPS Bidder's Library, at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/ to obtain access.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for maintenance and repair of  repairable services for the Consolidated Automatic Support System (CASS) RF Test System, Serial Number SHB011, located at the National Reconditioning Center NRC), Kansas City, Missouri, for the period of one year.  Type of support: 1) Unlimited access to CASS spare parts; 2) telephone support for NRC CASS technicians for CASS hardware repair; and 3) Historical turn around time of next day. The CASS was started by General Electric Corporation, Hewlett Packard and Teradyne.  The three company team never delivered a working CASS and sold out to Lockheed Martin. This system is classed as a Naval Weapons System supporting land and sea based aircraft. This system is not common equipment or used by any commercial repair facilities other than those of the United States Government, namely the National Weather Service (NWS) and the United States Navy (USN). The USN is the exclusive agent of the government, having control of configuration, part standards and software. The purchase of maintenance support, asset quality control, and configuration management is solely the responsibility of Lockheed Martin Inc. under its contract with the Navy. The Navy has asked the NWS to contract directly with Lockheed Martin to obtain these services.  The only common tie between the USN and the NWS involving this equipment is the support needed to maintain CASS assets and configuration control of the system, its software and all individual lowest replaceable parts.  No other source of maintenance is authorized or available for CASS support. The CASS machine in operation at the NRC is a unique electronic tester that is essential to the support of WSR-88D Doppler Weather Radar in service by the NWS.  It is the only CASS located at a non-Navy facility. The government will receive the best value by maintaining CASS utilizing a maintenance support agreement with Lockheed Martin Simulation, Training & Support because they are authorized to exchange parts with CASS users. All CASS assets and test support software remains under the supervision of the Navy in accordance with Navy requirements unique to this system. The government knows of no other qualified source and believes that this item is proprietary to Lockheed Martin Inc.  Any business source, able and authorized to perform maintenance and repair for the above equipment reference herein is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 30 calendar days after its publication. Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding its capability to maintain and repair the specified equipment and certification that they are authorized to repair the equipment.  Interested firms may send an email request to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or send a fax request with an email address to telephone number 816-426-7530 ATTN: Karen Christian. Failure to provide the required information will deem your request non-responsive. This is NOT a request for quote and there is no solicitation. The government reserves the right to solicit quotes based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to Lockheed Martin, Inc., whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the government without further notice. The anticipated award date shall be within 15 calendar days after date of this announcement. The NAICS code for this action is 811213.  This is not considered a small business set-aside. All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. All contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  For information and to register, please access the following websites: http://www.ccr.gov/ and http://www.bpn.gov.  In order to register with the CCR and ORCA to be eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet number. A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at http://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

<DESC>The USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service is contemplating four contracts to perform physicals on approximately 34 of our employees who are assigned field snow survey duties.  There will be one doctor in each quadrant of the state.  Contracts will only be awarded if there are successful contractors in each area.  We would like to find four Service Disabled Veteran doctors to perform these services; however, all sources will be considered.

We would need a doctor to perform these evaluations around October or November of this year.  Please review the paragraphs below to get a feel for what kind of physical we would need to determine physical fitness for duty.

(A) 	An annual physical examination shall be taken by each employee assigned to field snow survey, SNOTEL, and SCAN program duties in remote areas.  Physical examinations must be completed and medical clearance received before an employee participates in field operation duties.  The purpose of this examination is to determine the employee's physical condition as it relates to performing assigned duties of the snow survey program.  The job can be physically stressful and involve vigorous exertion in high altitude and/or extremely cold environments.  The examining physician shall be given an explanation of the requirements of the employee’s duties, and the physician will determine the intensity of an employee's physical examination and the specific medical tests to be included in that examination.  Consideration will be given to the employee's age, medical history and previous exam results, physical condition and general health.  Subsequent examinations will generally be less intensive than a first baseline examination, and will involve fewer tests or procedures.  The following medical tests and evaluations cover health and performance areas that the physician may consider for inclusion in an examination of an employee:

(1) 	Current or past medical condition should be reviewed to determine if any condition might be recurrent or aggravated by the conditions of the work.

(2) 	Cardiovascular fitness.  An EKG should be performed for all employees receiving this physical examination for winter snow surveying activities for the FIRST time.  This will provide baseline data.  Subsequent EKGs may be performed at the physician's discretion.

(3) 	Back problems.  Evaluate for current or potential back problems as determined by the physician.

(4) 	Respiratory system.  Perform a basic pulmonary test for all employees taking this physical examination for the FIRST time to establish baseline data.  A more detailed pulmonary function test should be performed subsequently if the physician's evaluations of the current symptoms warrant such a test.

<DESC>  Sources Sought for a Breathing Device for the Up-Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs)  and Other Tactical Wheeled Vehicles The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, PM Light Tactical Vehicles (PM LTV) Office, Warren, MI is conducting a Sources Sought Market Survey due  20 May 05.    This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP).  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, and is not to be construed as a commitment by TACOM-Warren . Light Tactical Vehicle Program Office is interested in obtaining information on the price, availability, system description, and operational/support concepts of an emergency breathing device/apparatus/system that is readily available for rapid integration into Army tactical vehicles. The proposed breathing device system for the Up-Armored HMMWVs and other tactical wheeled vehicles MUST take into consideration:       (1) The system will be used by soldiers to provide clean, breathable air for short durations (7 to 10 minutes (more desired)) for up to 5 individuals in a panic/emergency situation (assume 95th percentile male soldier) as they egress from their vehic le.  This emergency situation could include an overturned vehicle, in the dark, that is submerged in less than 5m of water.       (2) The device(s)/system may be integrated into various Army tactical vehicles.   Uninjured individuals must have easy/ready access to the system's output devices in all vehicle orientations, and must be easily stored within the vehicles.       (3) The system should be light (less than 20 lbs desired), and minimize vehicle space claims (less than 3 cu ft desired).       (4) Within the crew compartment, the devices(s)/system shall not explode and cause secondary fragments to be ejected as the result of a hazard, projectile, or fragment strike (minimal secondary fragments allowed only for those being carried by the pr ojectile/fragment).  If located outside the crew compartment, the system shall not incapacitate the vehicle's functions if the system is similarly damaged.  Mounting systems that prevent a compromised system or devices from becoming a secondary projectile and a hazard to the individuals are required (integration work with systems integrators may be required).        (5) Supporting the devices(s)/system shall pose minimal logistics burdens upon Army unit maintenance personnel, and shall require no additional personnel augmentation to support the systems.  The supporting devices and training shall be minimized (de sired - less than 2 hours of instruction via CD or instruction pamphlet).  Normal servicing of the system (e.g. recharging) shall be minimal (desired less than 5 minutes per vehicle system).       (6) It is desired that any centralized system allow the individuals to take an air source with them that provides up to 2 minutes (can be deducted from the system duration requirement for that individual, but not compromise the remaining air budget f or the other individuals still using the base system) of clean, breathable air as they perform complex physical maneuvers to evacuate the vehicle (assuming possible loss of use of one limb).  For such capabilities, it is desired that this clean, breathable  air source is not a part of the soldier's individual uniform/equipment during their normal operations outside of the vehicle.       (7) It is desired that minimal crew training is required (less than 1 hour of instruction via CD or instruction pamphlet).  It is further desired that the system require no special certifications on its use by soldiers or maintainers. The responses shall include the following:       (1) General Information: Name, address, phone number, CAGE Code, POC(s), company website, type of business (e.g., small, large, small disadvantaged, women-owned, 8a, etc.).       (2) Contractors experience/familiarity of the Up-Armored HMMWVs and other tactical wh eeled/ground combat vehicles.       (3) Specifications such as weight, performance and ease of installation.       (4) System test results or certifications.       (5) Cost estimate and availability of orders of up to 500 systems per month for an initial total of 10,000+ HMMWV based systems (higher production rate desired).  Additional requirements may follow for additional HMMWVs and other Army tactical wheele d vehicle systems.  Include any possible non-recurring (non-binding) Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) costs associated with a possible integration effort with a vehicle integrator (assume single HMMWV variant).                 (6) Is the breathing device a Commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) item?  Will quantity discounts apply?        (7)  Availability of system/device sets for possible system integration work.       (8) System/device(s) operational and support concepts.        (9) System/device safeguards and safety design features in the event of damage. All interested firms regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this announcement. Information provided by an offeror is for the Governments assessment of breathing devices that may meet the Governments needs for vehicle occupant safety.   Responden ts must label any technical data sent in response to this market survey with restrictive markings, if the response contains any trade secrets, propriety data or other confidential information that the respondents want protected.

<SUBJECT>B--SPECIAL NOTICE: GRASP II-MONTCAR-OCS Methane Gas
<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement.  The purpose of this notice is to announce the intent to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Mr. Barry Dickerson.  This purchase order shall be awarded in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  MMS anticipates awarding said purchase order to Mr. Dickerson for MMS' Resource Evaluation Modeling Technical Support requirement as specified below. MMS has mission critical needs that must be met by a contractor with the requisite knowledge, skills and abilities to work with MONTCAR, GRASP II and the OCS Methane Gas Hydrates model. It is anticipated that MMS shall use Mr. Dickerson's expertise in the use of these models to assist in developing MMS programs and policies, and performing resource assessment and evaluations of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas prospects. MMS currently uses the MONTCAR tract evaluation model, a proprietary, stochastic discounted cash flow simulator to develop the principal input to the government's estimate of the fair market value on which the Bureau's bid acceptance/rejection decisions are based.    MONTCAR has a number of advanced features and capabilities that meet the specific needs of the government in its role as the lessor of the mineral rights.  MMS also uses the GRASP II computer model, a probabilistic resource assessment program that assesses potential hydrocarbon resources in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  GRASP II is not proprietary; however it does contain extensive modules developed in-house by MMS that perform the economic analyses for the resource assessments. The MONTCAR and GRASP II models must continue to be maintained and enhanced and timely user support is critical to address ongoing evaluation needs and issues.  Mr. Dickerson will also act as the Subject Matter Expert for all aspects of the evaluation and assessment of offshore oil and gas prospects and U.S. leasing history and policies. This notice is not a formal solicitation.  This is NOT a request for an IT solution.  This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP).

<SUBJECT>R -- Facilitating the Implementation of Emergency Wireless Communications
<DESC>This notice concerns a proposed SOLE SOURCE modification of EXISTING Contract No. DTFH61-02-C-00015 held by the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) for “Facilitating the Implementation of Emergency Wireless Communications”.  The previously-published award price of NENA’s EXISTING contract is $849,877.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to increase that contract’s existing price, in order to fund the additional work described in the following items a through f.  For the price-increase, NENA will:  (a) Determine Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for which information needs to be developed and counties to contact; (b) Determine elements of needs assessment; (c) Contact state 9-1-1 coordinators, state wireless coordinators and county 9-1-1 coordinators to determine the level of information already available; (d) Contact via e-mail or telephone PSAPs in those counties without 9-1-1 coordinators at the state and county levels; (e) compile the results of the efforts described in the preceding items a through d; and (f) continue to provide updates to the Wireless Deployment Profile and continue to provide technical assistance to stakeholder organizations.  The time frame for accomplishing that additional work is six months.  It is believed that NENA is the only organization capable of performing the additional work just described, because NENA has developed and maintained an E 911 Deployment Database for several years, and it is the only database of its kind.  NENA possesses the baseline data, the experience and expertise, and the established relationships with the entities to be queried to compile the data necessary for the U. S. Department of Transportation to respond to the November 2003 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on E 911 deployment in the most efficient manner possible.   HOWEVER, any organization believing that it can clearly and convincingly demonstrate its ability to perform the contemplated additional work described in this notice----within the needed time frame----must, not later than May 20, 2005, submit a Statement of Qualifications proving such capability to:  Mr. James Mowery, Office of Acquisition Management, HAAM30-D, Federal Highway Administration, Room 4410, 400 Seventh Street, S.

<SUBJECT>B -- TIER 2 EXPLORATORY PROJECT:  ITS TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE PEDESTRIAN INJURIES AND FATALITIES
<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION	
Federal Highway Administration
TIER 2 EXPLORATORY PROJECT:  ITS TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE PEDESTRIAN INJURIES AND FATALITIES

AGENCIES: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), USDOT.
ACTION: Notice; Request For Information.
SUMMARY:  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT), is examining the feasibility of implementing innovative Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that will help prevent pedestrian crashes on roads as part of a wide-scale program.  

The purpose of this RFI is to request ideas containing concepts, as well as associated proof of concept information, for pedestrian crash prevention through the use and incorporation of ITS, particularly at locations where pedestrian crashes frequently occur.  This RFI is only a request for information and is not a request for application or proposal (no funding will be issued to this RFI).

OBJECTIVE:

The FHWA is emphasizing countermeasure systems that can detect a potential crash or conflict between a pedestrian and a motorist and then provide a warning to either the pedestrian or the motorist prior to the crash.  The concepts should be innovative and the systems dependent upon vehicle or pedestrian detection sensors (dynamic systems), but may involve passive systems.  An example of a passive system may be pre-timed or manually-activated flashing beacons at a crosswalk to warn motorists.  An example of a dynamic system would be one where the flashing beacons are activated only when pedestrians are detected.  These are the most basic examples of applying ITS solutions for the pedestrian crash problem.  Advanced solutions may incorporate multiple sensors and even pedestrian walking speed or multiple vehicle speeds.   Solutions should also incorporate advanced logic.  An example of using advanced logic would be a system that can differentiate between a curbside pedestrian waiting to cross a crosswalk from a pedestrian that happens to be walking past a crosswalk with no intention of crossing.

Alternatively, respondents can offer ITS-based concepts that prevent crashes without necessarily warning either pedestrians or motorists.  Examples might include systems that guide pedestrians toward crossings with crosswalks or improve pedestrian conspicuity or visual presence, particularly at night and twilight.  Other examples may include systems that modify motorists’ signal phasing when pedestrians are caught in a crosswalk at the end of the pedestrian signal phase.

This RFI is part of the FHWA’s Tier 2 initiative.  The objective of this Tier 2 initiative is to collect concepts that are shown to be technically and economically feasible and are shown to potentially reduce pedestrian crashes.  The next step toward implementing these concepts is a Tier 1 initiative.  

In a Tier 1 initiative, the FHWA will try to demonstrate the effectiveness of those prototype concepts collected by this RFI by conducting field operation tests, public demonstrations, public implementations at select sites, or by other means.  The goal of the Tier 1 initiative is to analytically prove whether or not a concept is worth deploying on a wide-scale basis.  Respondents whose concepts are selected for further review will be asked to bid for a Tier 1 initiative.

DATES: Responses to this announcement should be submitted on or before 42 days after the posted date of this RFI.  See the "How to Respond" section for electronic access and filing addresses.

POINT OF CONTACT: Ann Do, (ann.do@fhwa.dot.gov, 202-493-3319). Ms. Do is located at the United States Department of Transportation, Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center, 6300 Georgetown Pike McLean, VA 22101.  Office hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.  


BACKGROUND, SUPPORT INFORMATION AND COMMON PEDESTRIAN CRASH SCENARIOS 

The following information is supplied so that respondents can tailor their countermeasure to the specific crash types and causal factors that are most prevalent.  This allows for the countermeasure to have a higher potential for adoption and greater likelihood of acceptance in the traffic engineering and safety communities. 

Pedestrian crashes account for about 80,000 collisions per year, according to General Estimate System (GES) data from 1995 to 1998.  This represents about 1.2% of all crashes reported. Over this time, there were, on average, 6000 pedestrian fatalities per year (on average), accounting for about 15% of all roadway fatalities. A literature review suggests that pedestrian crashes occur at the following locations in order of frequency:
·	Urban mid-block locations
·	Urban intersections
·	Side of the road
·	Parking lots
·	Driveways/alleys

Pre-crash scenarios refer to the actions of vehicles and pedestrians immediately prior to a pedestrian crash.  A review of these pre-crash scenarios from GES data suggests that the most frequent scenario is one where a vehicle is going straight and the pedestrian is either crossing the street legally or illegally. This accounts for about 65% of all pedestrian crashes.  Fifteen percent of the pre-crash scenarios occur when a vehicle is either turning left or right (8.6% and 6.8%, respectively).

According to GES data, 55% of all pedestrian crashes occur at non-junctions, while 40% occur at intersections (or intersection-related locations). Of the non-junction pedestrian crashes, the overwhelming majority occur when a vehicle is traveling straight and the pedestrian is crossing/darting across the road, suggesting that these are midblock collisions. 

From the (Fatality Analysis Reporting System) FARS, it was determined that the pre-crash scenarios for fatal crashes are even more skewed to the vehicle traveling straight.  Turning vehicles represent about 4.1% of the fatal crashes (2.8% for left-turning and 1.3% for right-turning vehicles).  Common scenarios in fatal crashes involve a pedestrian improperly crossing (28.5%); walking/playing/working in the road (27.5%); and darting/stumbling/running onto road (9.9%).  However, the largest group, representing about a third of the crashes, is “other/unknown.”  “Other/unknown” is the result of no eyewitnesses present to account for the pedestrian’s actions.


A literature review  of pre-crash scenarios was used to determine which situations most frequently result in pedestrian crashes.  The following list shows the most common pre-crash scenarios.  The number in parentheses that follows each scenario represents the percentage of all pedestrian crashes that involved that particular pre-crash scenario.

1.	Vehicle going straight and pedestrian crossing roadway at a non-junction (25.9%)
2.	Vehicle going straight and pedestrian crossing roadway at an intersection (18.5%)
3.	Vehicle going straight and pedestrian darting onto roadway at a non-junction (16.0%)
4.	Vehicle turning left and pedestrian crossing roadway at an intersection (8.6%)
5.	Vehicle turning right and pedestrian crossing roadway at an intersection (6.2%)
6.	Vehicle going straight and pedestrian walking along roadway at a non-junction (3.7%)
7.	Vehicle going straight and pedestrian darting onto roadway at an intersection (2.5%)
8.	Vehicle backing up (2.5%)
9.	Vehicle going straight and pedestrian not in roadway at a non-junction (1.2%)
10.	Vehicle going straight and pedestrian playing/working in roadway 
at a non-junction (1.2%)

Examples of right-turn crashes and left-turn crashes are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.  Left-turn and right-turn pedestrian crashes can occur two different ways – 1) with the pedestrian walking towards the motorist from the opposite end of the street; and 2) with the pedestrian crossing the crosswalk from behind the motorist.  Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate the latter case, as this is more dangerous for the pedestrian.

[Figure 1 shows a vehicle stopped, facing north, at a stop sign at a four leg intersection. The opposite southern approach has a stop sign, but the other two east-west approaches do not.  A pedestrian is walking north into a crosswalk starting from the southeast corner of the intersection, directly to the vehicle’s right.  The vehicle is planning on turning right, as indicated by an arrow.]

Figure 1:  Example of a right-turn pedestrian crash
In a common right-turn pedestrian crash, the vehicle involved is stopped at a side street and is looking left for a gap in downstream traffic, whose approach is uncontrolled.  As a result of looking only for an available gap, the motorist does not see the pedestrian entering the crosswalk from the right.  The motorist puts more emphasis on looking for an available gap in traffic than in looking for pedestrians that have the right of way.  Figure 2 shows a typical left-turning crash scenario.

[Figure 2 shows a vehicle stopped in the middle of an intersection, facing east, at a four leg intersection.  The vehicle does not have a stop sign.  The opposite direction traffic does not have a stop sign.  North and South approaches do have a stop sign.  A pedestrian is walking east into a crosswalk starting from the northwest corner of the intersection.  The vehicle is planning on turning left, as indicated by an arrow.]

Figure 2:  Example of a left-turn pedestrian crash
Similar to Figure 1, Figure 2 shows a motorist waiting for a gap in opposing traffic prior to turning left.  The intersection is shown as two-way stop-controlled, but it could also be a standard 3-ball traffic signal, as well.  The left-turning motorist may or may not be stopped inside the intersection as shown in Figure 2, but is facing the same direction as the pedestrian.  Accordingly, the pedestrian comes into the motorist’s field of view from behind or from the motorist’s periphery.  The left-turning motorist is looking only for available gaps in opposite direction traffic and does not see the pedestrian in the crosswalk. 

Other Pedestrian Crash Factors
GES data also contained certain road features relevant to crash analysis. Of the 10 scenarios that contain a vehicle going straight, curves in the road were present in only 4% of the crashes and hillcrests were present in only 1% of the crashes.  

The literature also shows the distribution of speed limits for 5 of the 10 crash scenarios listed above involving a vehicle going straight and a pedestrian crossing at a non-junction - scenarios 1,3,6,9 and 10.  The most frequently observed speed limit in all of these scenarios was 25 mph.  This is intuitive based on the fact that most pedestrians would be located in urban areas where speed limits are lower than rural and suburban areas.  About 2/3 of all crashes in the above-mentioned scenarios occurred at posted speeds between 25 and 35 mph.  A high percentage of crashes in Scenarios 1, 6 and 9 occur at 55 mph (8.2%, 19.8%, and 19.3%, respectively).  While the majority of pedestrian crashes occur at lower speeds, higher speed crashes (40+ mph) are far more likely to result in fatalities.

A review of the distribution of traffic control devices for scenarios that occur at intersections is shown in Table 1.
Table 1:  Distribution of traffic control devices among select crash scenarios
[The X-axis of the table has 6 columns labeled:  “Traffic control device” scenario 2 scenario 4 scenario 5 scenario 7 scenario 8.  The Y-axis has 3 rows labeled “3 ball signal”  “stop sign” “no controls” and “other signs.”  The “3 ball signal” row reads 40.1% 57.7% 61.8% 36% and 7.1%.  The “stop sign” row reads 17.8% 14.5% 18.4% 8.0% 1.9%.  The “no controls” row reads 36.6% 25.9% 18.9% 55.6% 89.3%.  The “other signs” row reads 5.5% 1.9% .9% .3% 1.6%. The last column gives a total for each traffic control device.  For the 3-ball, it is 45.2%, for stop sign it is 15.5%, for no controls it is 36% and for other signs it is 3.3%]


The “traffic control device” in the first column of Table 1 relates to the traffic control that the motorist sees.  The 3-ball traffic signal was the most common control device in scenarios four and five, while in scenarios 7 and 8, the motorist typically had an uncontrolled approach (“no controls”).  The situation usually represents a two-way stop-controlled intersection where there are stop signs on the minor roads, but the motorist on the major road has no stop sign.

Further data were collected with regard to the whether or not the pedestrian was in the crosswalk, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2:  Distribution of pedestrian in or out of the crosswalk for all scenarios
[The X-axis of the table has 6 columns labeled:  “in crosswalk” scenario 2 scenario 4 scenario 5 scenario 7 scenario 8.  The Y-axis has 3 rows labeled “yes”  “no” and “total percentage.”  The total percentage rows all read 100%.  The “yes” row reads 31.2% 46.4% 49.2% 25% 16.8%.  The “no” row reads 68.8% 53.4% 50.8% 75% 83.2%]


In scenarios 1, 3, 6, 9 and 10, virtually 100% of pedestrian were not in the crosswalk at the time of the crash.

Other Contributing Factors and Conditions
The crash parameters above and the following crash contributing factors are useful in developing a crash countermeasure, because they allow for the system to be tailored to the most frequently occurring crash types and causal factors/parameters.  Causal factors were also examined for each scenario.  They were divided up by pedestrian causal factors and by motorist causal factors.  Table 3 shows several contributing factors and the distribution of them for each of the ten scenarios.
Table 3:  Causal factors and conditions for motorists on a per-scenario basis
[The x-axis is labeled scenarios 1 thru 10.  The Y axis is titled “contributing factor.”  Under it, 13 factors are labeled as such:  alcohol/drugs, impaired, driver distracted, driver vision, speeding/reckless driving, signal/sign violation, driver lost control, other violation charged, hit and run, other/clear day, other/adverse day, other/clear nigh, other/adverse night.  The first column reads (in percentages) 6.1, .1, 3, 3.6, 1.6, .3, 0, 8.5, 15, 32.6, 2.8, 21.9, 4.5.  The second column reads 7.2, .1, .8, 5.4, .4, 3.3, .1, .1, 9.7, 22.3, 26.1, 4.9, 15, 4.8.  The third column reads 1.4, 0, 1, 41.8, .2, 0, 0, 3.3, 3.1, 34.3, 1.2, 11.7, 1.9.  The fourth column reads 2.8, 0, 3, 5.1, .8, 8.8, .2, 13.5, 14.5, 32.4, 3.2, 9.9, 6.  The fifth column reads 9.3, 0, 1.1, 1.5, .2, 12.2, .4, 5.5, 22.3, 30.5, 4.9, 7.8, 4.4.  The sixth column reads 14.6, .8, 3.2, 4, .9, 0, .2, 4.1, 27.8, 12.8, 2.5, 24.9, 4.3.  The seventh column reads 1.3, 0, .2, 34.4, 0, 0.3, 0, 4.8, 1.8, 34.5, 1.9, 15.9, 4.9.  The eighth column reads 8.6, 0, 4.9, .7, .3, 0, 0, 11.6, 26.9, 24.4, 2.8, 11.4, 8.6.  The ninth column reads 16.3, 1, 9.8, 1.4, 8.6, 0, 9.5, 9.9, 23.7, 11, 0, 8.7, 0.  The last column reads 8.3, 0, 6.4, 4.2, 0, 0, 0, 21.6, 20.1, 23.7, 0, 14.9, .7]


“Impaired” refers to the motorist having a physical impairment unrelated to drugs or alcohol (e.g. drowsy, handicapped, etc.).   Also, there is a large percentage of crashes labeled “other.”  For these crashes, no causal factors were determined or reported by the police reports.  The “other” categories show that adverse environmental conditions are only a small factor in contributing to pedestrian crashes.  The table shows that a large number of crashes in scenarios 3 and 7 are caused by motorist’s obscured  vision.  Sign/signal violation (or other violation) occur for a large number of crashes only for scenarios 4, 5 and 10.  This can be seen more clearly in Figure 3.

[Figure 3 shows a stacked bar chart with all 10 scenarios on the x-axis and relative frequency on the y axis.  The legend has blue for sign/signal violation and red for other violation.  Scenario 1 shows about .5% sign/signal violation and about 11% for both violations types combined.  Scenario 2 shows about 5% sign/signal violation and about 16% for both violations types combined.  Scenario 3 shows about 0% sign/signal violation and about 8% for both violations types combined.  Scenario 4 shows about 11% sign/signal violation and about 27% for both violations types combined.  Scenario 5 shows about 12.5% sign/signal violation and about 21% for both violations types combined.  Scenario 6 shows about 1% sign/signal violation and about 10% for both violations types combined.  Scenario 7 shows about 1% sign/signal violation and about 8% for both violations types combined.  Scenario 8 shows about 0% sign/signal violation and about 13% for both violations types combined.  Scenario 9 shows about 0% sign/signal violation and about 16% for both violations types combined.  Scenario 10 shows about 0% sign/signal violation and about 23% for both violations types combined. All the scenarios show that 3% of crashes are due to stop sign/signal violation and that 14% of all crashes had some motorist violation associated with them.]

Figure 3:  Frequency of violations per crash scenario

It can be seen in Figure 3 that violations occur in scenarios 4 and 5, but also are heavily represented in scenarios 2, 9 and 10.

Table 3 shows that speeding, loss of control, and reckless driving are responsible for only a small percentage of the crashes in these 10 scenarios.  A significant proportion of the causal factors are represented by alcohol/drugs, hit and run, and other/clear (no causal factor found and weather was not a factor); it is unclear whether ITS technologies will be able to reduce crashes due to these causal factors.  Hit and run crashes were included in this to make this list complete, but clearly no causal factor can be attributed to the motorist in a hit and run crash if no witnesses were present.

Causal factors for pedestrian are also described.  Table 4 lists them by scenario.

Table 4:  Causal factors for pedestrians on a per-scenario basis
[The x-axis has all 10 scenarios.  The y axis is titled “contributing factor.” It has 4 labels:  Alcohol/drugs, impaired, improper crossing, and all other pedestrians.  The first row reads, in percentages as follows:  9.9, 9.5, 3.9, 3, 2, 10.5, 3.1, .6, .7, 0.  The second row reads .4, 1, .3, .6, 0, 1.8, 0, .8, 0, 0.  The third row reads 44.5, 17.1, 8.7, 8, 9.5, 0, 8.1, 16.7, .5, 0.  The last row reads 45.1, 72.3, 87, 88.4, 88.5, 87.7, 88.8, 81.9, 98.8, 100.]

“Improper crossing” refers to a pedestrian that is crossing either outside of the crosswalk or crossing when the pedestrian signal indicates that a crossing is unlawful.  Improper crossings are represented heavily in scenarios 1, 2 and 8.  Alcohol is a most represented in scenarios 1, 2 and 6, but it may prove difficult to alert or warn a pedestrian with an ITS-based solution if they are intoxicated or otherwise encumbered.  The last row - “all other pedestrians” - means that no causal was attributed to the pedestrian or none was identified.

Atmospheric conditions were also reviewed and summarized in Figure 4.  

[Figure 4 shows a stacked bar chart with each scenario on the x-axis and the proportion of crashes that occurred in the four following conditions:  night/adverse, night/clear, day/adverse, and day/clear. The following percentages are listed for each scenario in that same order.  Scenario 1:  7.8, 37.5, 3.9, 50.8.  Scenario 2:  8.5, 27.4, 8, 56.1, Scenario 3:  4.6, 21.8, 3.3, 70.3, Scenario 4: 9, 19.1, 6.9, 65.1, Scenario 5:  6, 20.3, 7.7, 66, Scenario 6:  7, 52.4, 4.8, 35.7, Scenario 7:  4.9, 22.2, 5.3, 67.6, Scenario 8:  19.8, 18.4, 7, 54.7, Scenario 9:  5.1, 34.3, 5.2, 55.5, Scenario 10:  .7, 33.6, 1.7, 64.1]

Figure 4:  Percentage of crashes by daytime and by weather condition for each scenario
Clear weather was reported when 87% of the crashes occurred.  Also, 64% of the crashes occurred in the daytime.

RFI RESPONDENTS REQUIREMENTS

Expected respondents include private industry, individuals, Universities, public agencies or research groups.  Respondents should submit  an information package of their concepts with supporting information to defend their concept.  Examples of supporting information can be found in this section of the RFI.

This FHWA initiative is focused on detection-and-warning systems, however, any system that detects the pedestrians/vehicles and prevents a crash will be considered.  The system need not warn a motorist or pedestrian, but could potentially alter a traffic signal.  Such a system would usually apply only at signalized intersections, and would not be applicable to mid-block crossings.  However, mid-block crossings occasionally have traffic signals or other warning beacons, that can be modified based on pedestrian presence or other factors.

The innovative concepts should present the crash scenario and/or type that each is addressing.  Respondents should be able to demonstrate how their product and concept will prevent or reduce crashes and show how the system will work in its entirety. Respondents should provide the following information, along with the concept:
·	Functional specifications and performance requirements	
·	System and technological needs (e.g. does the technology currently exist) 
·	Commercial availability and timeline
·	System details
·	Supporting data (if available)
·	Deployment potential
·	Brief economic analysis

The above bullets are discussed in more detail below.

Functional specification and performance requirements:
FHWA would like respondents to describe each concept’s functional specifications and performance requirements.  Functional specifications refer to the individual sub-functions that inter-relate to form a working concept.  Respondents should describe how the system works as a whole and how each component of the system is inter-related to perform the function that the concept is proposing.  For example, if a system were to simply detect a curbside pedestrian and display an overhead warning to approaching motorists, the overall system at a minimum, would be comprised of a detection sub-system, a warning sub-system, and also a communication sub-system between the two.  However, there may be additional sub-systems that facilitate or back up the communication process.  In addition, any logic that may be programmed into either of the sub-systems should also be explained. 

Performance requirements refer to the specifications of individual components.  For example, if a system includes a pedestrian sensor, the respondent should provide its range of detection, accuracy levels, etc.  Alternatively, if a system includes a display for communicating information to a pedestrian (or motorist), then the respondent should indicate the range of view for the display.  Similarly, if a warning were audible, the respondent should include decibel levels and show that it can be heard above typical road noise levels.  These are only examples; all components should have estimated performance specifications listed.

System and technological needs:
Respondents can provide concepts that are a combination of off-the-shelf products, are producible as one complete system, or concepts that are theoretical in nature.  Should the respondent’s concept include performance specifications that are not currently attainable in commercially available products, respondents should document these specification shortcomings.  Respondent can optionally offer alternative methods to accomplish the necessary functions that cannot be satisfied using commercially available products.

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems
necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

2. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

3. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically
destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

SELECTION INTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS: Personal interviews may be scheduled for firms slated as most highly qualified. Firms slated for interviews may be asked to explain management and design team components, QC process; and to provide design solutions to actual/hypothetical projects, etc. Elaborate presentations are not desired. 

Site visits will not be arranged during this period. Debriefing requests will not be entertained prior to 45 days after the submittal due date. It is the Government’s intent to incorporate Look-Up Tables into the contract as mandatory payment provision.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.   Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

              NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

I.  SCOPE OF WORK
Background

The USAID Europe and Eurasia Bureau (E&E) is involved in a comprehensive program of assistance to the states of the former Soviet Union and to Central and Eastern Europe.  E&E’s strategy focuses on three core areas: economic restructuring and growth, democracy and governance and the social dimensions of transition.  In addition, USAID develops cross-sector approaches to address critical obstacles and changing circumstances in the region.  During 2003–2004, these include:   systematically addressing corruption and conflict in program analysis and design; further developing social sector initiatives to broaden the benefits of reform and thereby sustain public support for it; and raising the profile of values inherent in transition programs. .

Three essential elements of E&E’s assistance to the region include helping to establish full democracies rooted in good governance and anticorruption, nurturing vibrant market economies, and supporting the emergence of a responsive social safety net to meet the needs of the people, especially those disadvantaged during difficult times of transition.

Within E&E, the Office of Democracy, Governance and Social Transition (E&E/DGST) provides the Bureau and the USAID field missions in the region with technical and strategic expertise on policy and strategies; program design, development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation; and program management for democracy and governance and social transitions, especially marginalized populations, health, labor and social safety nets.  The Office has three teams; Social Transition, Health and Democracy.  The teams serve as the Bureau’s key technical liaison in their respective fields with other USAID Bureaus and Offices, U.S. government agencies (particularly the Department of State and Department of Justice), international donors and external stakeholders.

E&E recognizes that corruption constrains progress in all development sectors and subsectors, including democracy, rule of law, health, social transition, economic growth and energy.  E&E anti-corruption assistance is cross-cutting by supporting reforms intended to combat corruption within individual sector and subsector assistance programs.   E&E’s strategic approach in combating corruption utilizes USAID’s Anti-Corruption Strategy, as well as the Bureau’s programming emphasis on sector reforms that enhance Transparency, Accountability, Prevention, Education and Enforcement.  

E&E countries frequently suffer from poor governance and public administration practices, particularly in executive branches.   Recent changes in leadership in certain E&E countries, including Georgia and Ukraine, have enhanced opportunities in reforms and practices that enhance good governance within executive branch bodies.  Areas that may require assistance include developing procedures and practices that assist officials in: establishing priorities for policy formulation amidst competing priority needs and public expectations;  supporting and monitoring the implementation of new policies and reforms; ensuring the accountable performance of duties by officials and staff, including the proper handling of resources entrusted to them; establishing appropriate information flows vertically and horizontally within and across government bodies; and enhancing  information flows  to media and citizens.   
       
Position Overview

The incumbent is a member of E&E/DGST’s Democracy Team.  As part of the Democracy Team, S/He has primary responsibility for providing technical advice to the E&E Bureau, State Department, USAID field offices in the E&E region, and other units of USAID in all areas related to good governance and anti-corruption, including anti-corruption issues and efforts that impact progress in democracy, health, social transition [and economic growth] areas.   The incumbent works closely with other E&E sector specialists, the E&E Program Office,  and others in the Agency or Bureau involved with anticorruption, especially coordinating with DGST’s Senior Rule of Law Advisor. 

The incumbent also plays a critical role in defining and formulating the strategic focus and content of USAID’s anti-corruption assistance in E&E countries such that it complements programs implemented by other USG departments, including the Department of Justice and the Department of State/International Narcotics and Law Enforcement.  S/He represents the E&E Bureau in discussions regarding USAID/E&E anti-corruption and good governance assistance programs with the Office of the Assistance Coordinator for Europe & Eurasia at the Department of State.   S/He serves as an interlocutor among the E&E Bureau, USAID’s DCHA Bureau, State Department, and the Department of Justice    
The advisor is responsible for developing and/or managing regional projects to assist in development of good governance models and regional cooperation among states in pursuit of government reforms and, where relevant, issues pertaining to accession to the European Union or other international bodies.

The incumbent also assists USAID field offices in the region in responding to appropriate foreign government requests for consultation and technical assistance supporting good governance at any level of state government and combating corruption.


Duties and Responsibilities

a)  Provide Bureau leadership in the analysis of governance/public administration and corruption in the region.  This includes assisting USAID missions to formulate good governance and anticorruption strategies for individual countries; reviewing strategies submitted; leading and participating in governance and anticorruption assessments; directing good governance and anticorruption contract and/or grant evaluations; reviewing unsolicited proposals; and responding to Congressional inquiries.

b)  Serve as a senior advisor to the Europe and Eurasia Bureau with regard to the status of good governance and major anti-corruption initiatives in the E&E region, including activities of other USG agencies, host governments, other donors and non-governmental organizations.  With an in-depth knowledge of USAID's good governance and anticorruption programs across the region, represent the Agency in inter-agency and international forums.

c)  Represent Bureau and Agency interests and best practices to senior–level and other host-government officials, as well as to NGO, business, and other host country stakeholders.  Coordinate and liaise with other USG agencies and donors from other countries.

d)  Design new project components and activities to be implemented by Missions or contractors and/or grantees. This includes preparing scopes of work, requests for proposals/applications, Acquisition and Assistance requests, decision memos, Congressional Notifications, and inter-agency agreement letters.

e)  Travel within the E&E region to provide hands-on consultations, strategy formulation, assessments, and monitoring of on-going good governance and anticorruption activities.  Represent the Bureau and/or the agency at international conferences and workshops relevant to governance and anticorruption.

f)  Provide briefings to U.S. and foreign officials, Congress, and other donors on USAID programming in the region.    

g)  As needed, act as Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for assigned contracts and grants, including day-to-day responsibility for monitoring implementation of activities, tracking financial issues, processing obligation actions and other requests to OP under the contracts/grants, and responding to requests for approvals of individual activities.


Supervision

While the incumbent works under the direction of the Democracy Team Leader and coordinates with the Senior Rule of Law Advisor on Anti-Corruption, he/she needs to demonstrate a high degree of autonomy and responsibility.  As a recognized authority in the analysis and evaluation of programs and issues, the incumbent is subject only to administrative and policy direction concerning overall project priorities and objectives.  The incumbent is typically delegated complete responsibility and authority to plan, schedule and carry out major projects concerned with the analysis and evaluation of programs or organizational effectiveness.  Analyses, evaluations and recommendations developed by the incumbent are normally reviewed by management officials only for potential influence on broad agency policy objectives and program goals.  Findings and recommendations are often accepted without significant changes.

Required Skills and Qualifications
The Senior Governance/Anticorruption Advisor must be an individual with sound judgment, excellent writing and communication skills and have a well-developed understanding of U.S. foreign policy interests and the role USAID programming can play in the development of democracy. The successful candidate must be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice.  Since work often involves changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual must be someone who is highly flexible and able to work on multiple tasks simultaneously.

The facility is expected to enable the Naval Academy to effectively compete with major collegiate athletic programs, and other U.S. military academies (U.S. Military Academy at West Point & the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado).  Therefore, the Government is seeking a facility design that is architecturally and aesthetically unique and superior; functionally outstanding for athletes, spectators, and broadcasters; and conducive to effective showcasing and multi-media broadcasting of athletic events on a local and national level.

Since the Naval Academy is a National Trust Historic Landmark District, the design and construction must be sensitive to the history and traditions of the Naval Academy.  The design will undergo stringent local, State, and National historic preservation reviews as part of the design/build process. The facility must also comply with DOD anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) criteria.

This is a design-build project that will be procured utilizing a two-phase process per FAR Part 36.  The estimated cost of construction is $45,482,000.00.

Evaluation of Past Performance will be a subjective assessment.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services as well as fair and reasonable pricing.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s record of conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship, and will evaluate the offeror’s record on cost control/change orders and adherence to contract schedules.  Subcontractor management, safety management, and other quality control programs will also be reviewed.  The Government will examine the offeror’s record for reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to customer satisfaction, and in general, the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer. Offerors may be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the offeror’s response will be taken into consideration.  A review of CCAS and ACAS may be performed.

Of the total subcontracted effort, the targets are a minimum of 15.3% to SDB firms, 13.8% to WOSB firms, 3.1% to HUBZone Small Business firms, and 3% to SDVOSB firms.  Large business firms will be evaluated against these targets with more credit given to firms who exceed these targets.  Factor 6 – (Design Solution).  Provide schematic building design drawings, schematic building elevations, schematic building section, site plan (s), perspective/axonometric sketch, study model and additional site, floor plan (s). All drawings shall illustrate the incorporation of the Anti Terrorism Force Protection requirements. PRICE.

Provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items (1/99), do not apply to this acquisition.  The evaluation process to be used is described below:
  
Evaluation Process: Award will be made to the responsible contractor whose offer conforms to this request and is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government considering price and non-price factors.  Accordingly, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the low Offeror based on the following criteria:

Technical Proposal
Total Evaluated Price Proposal

Technical Proposal is significantly more important than price and consists of the following factors:

Factor A – Past Performance 50%
Factor B – Technical Merit 50%

Technical proposal shall not exceed 20 single sided pages of 8-½ X 11-size papers with 12 pitch.  Brochures or other pre-printed material may be submitted.  If pre-printed material is submitted it is required to be included in the 20 pages.  

The Technical Proposal will be evaluated using the following rating criteria:

Exceptional (E) – The proposal exceeds the requirements and provides an exceptional or outstanding approach that fully satisfies the Government requirements. A complete understanding of the solicitation is demonstrated.  Award could be made without exchanges with the Offeror.  The Contractor demonstrates an excellent Experience Modifier Rate (EMR) and OSHA Incident Rate.

Acceptable (A) – The proposal fully satisfies the requirements and demonstrates a good understanding of the solicitation. All elements are adequately addressed. Minor weaknesses may be noted, however, award could be made without exchanges with the Offeror. The Contractor demonstrates an acceptable EMR and OSHA Rate

Marginal (M) – The proposal does not fully meet the requirements. Minor deficiencies are identified which could indicate an insufficient understanding of the requirements.  With minor revisions or clarifications the proposal has a reasonable chance of becoming technically acceptable.  The Contractor demonstrates a marginally acceptable EMR and OSHA Rate.

Unacceptable (U) – The proposal fails to satisfy the requirements and the approach contains an unacceptable level of risk to the Government.  Major deficiencies have been identified which would require major revision or re-write.  Without major revision or re-write the proposal does not have a reasonable chance of becoming technically acceptable. The Contractor demonstrates an unacceptable EMR and OSHA Rate

Factor A – Past Performance:  The Government will evaluate the quality of the Offeror’s past performance.  The Government will consider recent, relevant sources, context, and trends. Past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the Offeror to successfully meet the requirements as set forth in this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to obtain information in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources.  Offerors must provide the following information regarding past performance:  submit information on up to three projects that demonstrate performance on work that is similar in scope, size (or larger) and complexity to the work described in this solicitation.  Past performance information must include: location where work was performed, point of contact and point of contact telephone number, and contract number.  Include construction awards, customer letters of commendation, etc., with point of contact and telephone numbers.  Submit Experience Modifier Rate and OSHA Incident Rate for the past three (3) years.  If there are extenuating circumstances concerning your rating, provide background information and references for validation.

Factor B – Technical Qualifications: Offeror must submit the design layout of the proposed work, material to be used, and the technical solution for the overall work completed. Provide surface preparation requirements and installation details from the manufacturer of the proposed roofing system.  The Government requires a ten (10) year warranty on the roofing system.  Warranty periods offered in excess of the minimum specified will receive favorable consideration.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement is a sole source notice constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Requirement for mission unique consoles (RF-19-S-USB) from MARCO, Inc., Birmingham, Alabama.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: After reviewing other vendors product MARCO was the only vendor that had a standard product that met the specifications of our existing console design in our MDC at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).  This console design is critical to our launch operations.	MARCO's product accommodated the current Enhanced Telemetry Display System (ETDS) and equipment used for operations. A change to another vendor's product would require a recertification of the new product to ensure it meets all requirements.  This product also fits the size and spacing requirements of our existing facilities.  Any change in size would impact the available space in the MDC and require a reevaluation to ensure all life safety codes and fire codes are still met. Any new product would also need to be evaluated for operations and ergonomic function.  This product is part of a time critical cutover of our MDC at KSC.  There is a limited operational window for the installation of this equipment. Given the current time constraints a design and build type of this procurement, it is not feasible to integrate another console design into the existing console design and would impact our operations, if procured from another vendor.  This determination was made after an extensive canvassing of various technology industry personnel for alternative suppliers and yielded no other competitive suppliers of the referenced product.  It is in the best interest of NASA to sole source this procurement to MARCO who has the only standard product that meets the requirements of an existing console design and time requirements of the fully operational MDC. The provisions and clauses in this solicitation are those in effect through FAC 01-26. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.   The NAICS Code (334310) and the small business size standard for this procurement is 500 employees.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer of mission suitability, which shall be considered by the agency.  However, based on the information above, the government does not anticipate any offers that can meet the requirements. Delivery to KSC is required within the government's schedule.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Offers for the items(s) described above are due by COB, 5:00PM. EST on May 06, 2005 to OP-LS, KSC, FL 32899, solicitation number NNK05LA66P, FOB destination to KSC, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>PNNL will need a web-based software tool to facilitate managers to take systematic and proactive measures to (i) document existing internal controls; (ii) assess the adequacy of internal controls in programs and operations; (iii) separately assess and document internal control over financial reporting consistent with the requirements of OMB Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Internal Control; (iv) assist in identifying needed improvements; (v) managing corresponding corrective action; and (vi) report periodically on the status of internal controls. 

The software needs to support the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s Enterprise Risk Management Integrated Framework (COSO-ERM) for internal controls and the audit requirements similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for Internal Controls.  Accordingly, the software should ideally allow the organization’s objectives, risks to those objectives and risk response to be captured.

Key benefits to be derived from this software include ease in documenting Internal Controls and the Control Environment, effective management of the Internal Control assessment process including identification Internal Control deficiencies, corrective actions and reporting.  By implementing the use of this tool, a reduction in annual cost of assessing and reporting on Internal Control required by OMB Circular A-123 should be achieved.  
	
In addition, the software will be expected to provide internal control documentation required by other audit agencies such as DCAA, Department of Energy Inspector General as well as others.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. NNA05109810Q-DAF TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR SIMLAB SIMULATION PARTICIPANTS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions that have been submitted. Questions and Answers Q:  The response date stated on the solicitation says May 12th but in the body of the request (page 4) it says May 16th, which is correct? A: Question is addressed in Amendment 1. Q: On page 3 of the solicitation, it reads The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 488190 and $6M respectively.	Does this mean that the small business annual revenue must not exceed 6 million dollars, or is this referring to something else? A: Annual Receipts - Gross receipts are averaged over a concern's latest three (3) completed fiscal years to determine its average annual receipts.  "Receipts" means the concern's gross or total income, plus cost of goods sold, as defined by or reported on the concern's Federal Income Tax return.  The term does not include, however, net capital gains or losses, or taxes collected for and remitted to a taxing authority if included in gross or total income.	The concern may not deduct income taxes, property taxes, cost of materials or funds paid to subcontractors.  Travel, real estate and advertising agents, providers of conference management services, freight forwarders, customs brokers and tour operators may deduct amounts they collect on behalf of another.  If a concern has not been in business for three (3) years, the average weekly revenue for the number of weeks the concern has been in business is multiplied by 52 to determine its average annual receipts.  For more information about size standards see:	 http://www.sba.gov/size/index.html    Q: Is there a time frame from when these RFQs are submitted to when the RFPs will be requested? A:  This Combined Synopsis/Solicitation is the only document that will be issued requesting quotes for this procurement.   The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on May 2, 2005.

RE: Questions & Answers -

QUESTION #1:  The Statement of Work SCOPE (Paragraph 1.0) states "This statement of
work (SOW) defines the effort required for product evaluation and product
demonstrations for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) property management
system."  In addition the SOW explains the requirements for the product
demonstration, testing, evaluation, and the proposal requirements.  The
evaluation criteria also cover the ability to meet the technical
requirements, past performance, and price.  The SOW, Attachment A does not
provide information regarding the requirements for overall implementation
and integration of the solution into the NSF environment.  Therefore, are
the firm fixed price costs that you require in the PRODUCTION SCHEDULE  for
the Base Period 6/1/05 - 5/31/06 "Installation, Data Migration, Training"
for the product evaluation portion of the solution?  Also, are these 3
areas (Installation, Data Migration, Training) the only areas you require
to be priced?

ANSWER:  The line item "Base Period   6/1/05-5/31/06 “Installation, Data Migration, Training   $___________" is revised to include only training on the proposed system.  Base Period – Training $___________".


QUESTION #2:   The Statement of Work, Evaluation Criteria (Paragraph 3.3) states "The
Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.
Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications
to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not
later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 23, 2005.     Such
capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of
determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive
basis.     A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed
effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this
notice, is solely within the discretion of the government."  Based upon
this statement has a determination been made (as of this date) by the
Government to not compete the proposed effort?

ANSWER: See Amendment to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation 02 - Posted date on 04/07/2005 for your answer to the above question.


QUESTION# 3:  Based upon the answer to question # 2. "Will the existing data need to
be transferred into the new system? If so, what format will that data be
received? Existing data would need to be transferred. NSF's system
integrators will be able to convert this data in accordance with the
vendor's specifications."  Is this stating that NSF has already determined
their Systems Integrator for this solution, or can a software vendor submit
with a Systems Integrator as the Prime?

ANSWER:  NSF intends to procure integration services separately.  See answer to question #1.

Through two separate three-week training programs, Central American, Dominican Republic and Andean information technology (IT) managers from traditional manufacturing and services sectors will receive training in the use of IT to improve efficiency and productivity and increase their customer base, with emphasis on supply chain management and the integration of IT into “back office” operations.

The objective of the program is to provide fellows with the tools and perspective to make informed decisions about acquiring, implementing, and planning for the integration of both existing and emerging information technologies into their home companies.

II.	SCOPE OF WORK

The Contractor shall be required to provide Information Technology Management Training for two sessions of the 2005 program.  The Contractor shall design, develop and provide training for a two day orientation to be held on June 6th and 7th, and a one day the wrap-up session on June 24, 2005 for the first session and September 6-7 and 24 (September dates to be confirmed) for the second session.  Each training program shall consist of a two day Orientation session and a one day Wrap-up session.  Each day shall be a minimum of eight hours per day (excluding lunch hour) 

The Inter-American E-Business Fellowship Program provides training through site visits, seminars and roundtable discussions to mid-level Information Technology Managers for small and medium sized businesses from Central America and the Andean region.  The purpose of the fellowship is to learn how U.S. companies are using information technology to better run their businesses.  The three week fellowship will begin with two days of training to give fellows a framework for the following 2 weeks of site visits, seminars and roundtable discussions.  

Approximately 30 fellows (15 in each session) will participate in the two-day orientation program in Washington, D.C.  Following the orientation, fellows will spend 2 weeks visiting U.S. companies where they will be exposed to various aspects of e-business and IT implementation.  Finally, they complete their training with a one-day wrap-up session.

For the June session, fellows will spend a week in Washington, DC and then travel to Seattle, WA and San Jose, CA for site visits with companies such as: Qualcomm, Global exchange, Computer Associates, Microsoft, Expeditors, Weyerhaeuser, Hewlett Packard, and the San Jose Entrepreneur Center and IT Incubator.  The Contractor shall not be required to travel with the program participates.  The wrap up session conducted by the Trainer will complete the participants training program.  

The Government reserves the right to modify the training materials and format for the second session depending on the outcome and evaluation of the program by the participants.  

Fellows – For the June session, the fellows are 15 IT managers from small and medium sized enterprises in Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama and Nicaragua.  They come from a wide variety of industries including: Information Technology, Banking, Furniture Manufacturing, Handicrafts, Textiles, Insurance, Appliance repair service and education.  The Contractor will be provided with profiles of the group.  The September fellows will be selected in June and will be from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.

Orientation

During the Orientation, the Trainer will be required to:

Establish a framework or context for the following 2 weeks of site visits.  Immediately following the training session fellows will visit many U.S. companies to learn how they are using information technology to better run their business.  The training session is expected to give the fellows the necessary tools to take full advantage of these site visits.  To prepare the fellows for these site visits, the orientation session must address the following:

•	Issues and trends in Information Technology

•	Key Information Technology management issues such as identifying your IT needs, e-commerce buying and selling, back-end operations (accounting, inventory, etc.), knowledge management, evaluating and selecting the best software for your needs.

•	Case Studies:  Best practices of top performers in e-business and how to apply these best practices to the small and medium sized business. 

•	Provide feedback regarding each fellow’s own business situation.

•	During the fellowship, fellows will be required to develop an “E-Change Plan” for their company.  As part of the wrap up session fellows will present their e-change plan to the trainer and group for feedback.  (Fellows will be encouraged to bring their own laptops and may choose to conduct PowerPoint Presentations; however, Trainer will not be required to provide any sort of hardware to the fellows.)  During the initial training, the Trainer must present this assignment to the fellows.

•	Prepare fellows for completion of their assignment during the following weeks.

•	Establish format for developing individual “e-change” plans and discuss how to overcome the obstacles to e-change.

•	Prepare fellows to gain the most from the site visits.  E.g. steps they can take to implement an e-change plan once they return; leading discussions that help the fellows understanding the IT challenges that face them and identifying their IT priorities.

Schedule

Monday June 6: The trainer will provide a short, broad overview of e-business.  The Contractor will engage the fellows in a discussion about their “home business” goals and objectives and key management issues in the implementation of IT, while providing a context in which to view the upcoming days’ workshops and roundtables.  Trainer will also discuss the need to develop a technology related business plan and lay the groundwork for presentation on day 2 of assignment.  Past experience indicates that fellows are especially interested in case studies.

Tuesday June 7: The trainer will: 
1)	Lead fellows in a goal-oriented discussion on how to make the most of their time at the U.S. host companies.

2)	Present the fellows with a two-part assignment that they will work on during the next 2 1/2 weeks.  It is intended that the majority of their efforts will focus on Part 2 of the assignment.

Part 1:  The fellows will create an inventory of innovative uses of IT at the host companies, with a “best practices” focus.  Fellows will use this inventory to apply best practices to a clearly defined problem in their particular business.

Part 2:  The fellows will develop a plan for IT-related improvement/changes in their home companies.  The discussion should include a thorough exploration of 1) who the stakeholders are and their interests; 2) how to assess their home company’s IT-readiness; 3) issues to be considered in both developing and managing an IT-implementation plan.

Friday June 24 - Wrap-Up Session

Fellows will present Part 1 of their assignment to the trainer and the group of fellows.  Trainer will facilitate session.

Fellows will present Part 2 of their assignment to the group and the trainer.  They will critique each other and will discuss each plan’s feasibility.  The trainer will moderate the oral presentations and will assist fellows in setting realistic targets and assessing their organizations’ readiness to implement e-change.

The Contractor shall provide an oral evaluation of each fellow’s e-change presentation.  The evaluation will include a discussion of realistic measurable goals and timelines for fellows in accomplishing e-change.

Materials –Commerce will reproduce the materials if the trainer provides a copy of the PowerPoint Presentation and any additional materials for distribution one week prior to the training.  Commerce will provide A/V equipment for PowerPoint presentation.  Trainer is NOT expected to provide any equipment to the fellows.

Language – English language fluency is required to participate in the 2005 E-Business Fellowship Program and all training and materials will be provided in English.

At the end of each session, the Contractor shall be required to develop and provide an evaluation sheet for each participant to complete.
