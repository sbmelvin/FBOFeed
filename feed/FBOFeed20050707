<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services from Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas (Dr. Hamed Sari-Sarraf) on a sole source basis.

Period of Performance: September 1, 2005  - August 31, 2006.

Professional services are required over a 12-month period for the creation of a system for the segmentation of objects in biomedical images by shape.  As part of NLM R&D work to create a Content-Based Image Retrieval System for biomedical images, several segmentation algorithms for spine x-rays have been previously developed, using different segmentation methodologies.  These algorithms have been valuable testbeds for understanding the interaction among algorithmic approaches and parameters, vertebral shape modeling, and statistical pixel characteristics of an important national collection of spine x-ray images collected in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II).   However  NLM now intends to build upon these previous efforts by removing some of the limitations of these initial systems, adding additional capability, and integrating all of the methods into a "shape segmentation system" that will afford the user a menu of shape segmentation methods available under a common interface.  It is the intent of NLM to use this shape segmentation system as a component in a future CBIR system.  In addition, this system, or one or more of its segmentation methods, will be used as a tool for segmenting a large collection of spine x-ray images.

Task description: Subtask 1: 	Review government-provided concepts for integrated shape segmentation system and production level segmentation system, and provide expert feedback and recommendations.  Review initial set of new vertebrae shape models provided by the government and provide technical critique of the feasibility of supporting these models in the TT Group.  Provide technical feedback on any Standard Interface Requirements (SIR) and Standard Segmentation Format (SSF) requirements provided by the government.  Create initial design concepts for the integrated segmentation system.  Conduct research into further improving segmentation performance for the spine x-ray images. Subtask 2: 	Implement integrated segmentation system at first level  capability (possibly partial functionality).  Review refined vertebrae shape models, and SIR/SSF requirements and provide technical analysis and feedback.  Provide initial test results using one or more of the TT Group methods and using refined vertebrae shape models.  Continue research into further improving segmentation performance for the spine x-ray images, including implementation of optimized segmentation. Subtask 3:  Implement integrated segmentation system at initial version of full functional capability, although possibly without optimized spine x-ray segmentation.  Continue research into further improving segmentation performance for the spine x-ray images, including implementation of this optimized segmentation.  Provide test results for multiple spine x-ray images, including both cervical and lumbar spines, for all of the TT Group methods.  Identify a method or methods most suitable for incorporation into the production level segmentation system and implement any required changes to make this method operate efficiently in the production system. Subtask 4: Incorporate new optimized spine x-ray segmentation into the integrated segmentation system.  Test all methods in the integrated system on spine x-rays, other non-spine grayscale images, and color images.  Test the optimized spine x-ray segmentation on a significant number of spine x-ray images, including both cervical and lumbar spine images.  

For subtasks 1-4, the Contractor will use digitized x-ray images made available by the government.

Texas Tech University is uniquely qualified for this work because of the expertise and experience of the principal investigator below (Dr. Sari-Sarraf) in the specific area of image segmentation combined, with his extensive educational background and research experience in advanced image processing and numerous other technical publications, and the support of the facilities and staff of the Texas Tech Computer Vision and Image Analysis Laboratory (CVIAL). Dr. Sari-Sarraf has been the principal investigator for all of the segmentation methods that are the focus of research and development for the proposed contract work.

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisitions of Non-Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services from The Curators of the University of Missouri, Rolla, Missouri (Dr. R. Joe Stanley) on a sole source basis.

Period of Performance: September 1, 2005  - August 31, 2006.

Professional services are required over a 12-month period for the analysis, design and development of techniques for (1) illumination normalization of uterine cervix images, (2) unifying and extending spine x-ray classification work to make it independent of shape resolution, and (3) medical validation of segmented vertebral shapes. The Communications Engineering Branch (CEB) of the National Library of Medicine conducts research and development into the archiving and retrieval of biomedical multimedia information using technology such as Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), which allows the retrieval of images by features such as shape, color, and texture of regions of interest within the images. Normalization of illumination across images is a prerequisite for effective retrieval for images with color and texture features. Digitized uterine cervix images are available in pairs for each visit of the survey participant. Many images exhibit uneven or high dynamic range in illumination across the image. In some cases pertinent pathology is in shadow. It is necessary to normalize the images for these conditions as well as automatically lighten the shadows where possible. NLM also maintains digitized spine x-ray images from second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II). Prior work on classifying segmented vertebral boundaries for pathology needs to be unified and extended to allow shapes of different resolutions. Varying degree of detail is available at these resolutions and can help improve image retrieval experience. Modified code should also be compatible with current network oriented CBIR system being developed at NLM. The work will also build an extended reference set of segmented vertebrae from the digitized images by collecting from at least two medical experts' segmentations of vertebrae for 5000 shapes from approximately 1000 images of the digitized spine, according to specifications and methodology negotiated with the government, including both cervical and lumbar spine images from the NHANES II data set. 

Task description: Subtask 1: 	Implement an extended capability of illumination and color normalization on uterine cervix images.The investigator shall continue the illumination normalization work previously done by (a) extending the algorithm capability to normalize color and luminance across image pairs as well as across the collection to improve retrieval quality; and (b) lighten shadow regions to (i) improve feature computation and (ii) assist in visual analysis. It may be necessary to share results from this work with other Government contractors. If such a need arises, the Government shall specify the appropriate interface formats. In addition, for the core task, the Government shall provide images, information about computed features, and any other guidance as necessary. Subtask 2: Extend capability of classification algorithm for digitized spine x-ray images. The investigator shall update earlier work on classification of segmented vertebral shapes for presence / absence of anterior osteophytes, disc space narrowing, and subluxation and spondylolisthesis to include shapes of different resolutions. NLM currently uses a variety of resolutions for vertebral shape data ranging from 9 point coarse boundary outlines to more than 400 boundary points. Classification algorithms developed earlier do not support this variety and are not suitable for use in a network oriented CBIR system. Proposed task will include updating the algorithms and making it usable in a system setting. The Government shall provide necessary information to make it suitable to interface with the system.
Subtask 3: Collect spine x-ray reference segmentations. The investigator shall, through the involvement of board certified medical experts, build an extended reference set of segmented vertebrae from the digitized images. The Government shall provide the investigator with segmented boundary shapes. The investigator shall collect from at least two board certified medical experts, reviews on segmentations of vertebrae in approximately 1000 images of the digitized spine, according to specifications and methodology negotiated with the government. The reviews will include validation with corrections, if necessary, of existing segmented boundaries, 9-point landmark markup validation, and pathology detail (anterior osteophytes, disc space narrowing, subluxation and/or spondylolisthesis, and other observations, if any) for 5000 vertebrae from images be provided by the Government. Both cervical and lumbar spine images and segmentations will be included. The protocol for segmentation review and the software will be provided by the Government. It is expected that the medical experts will have available to them the necessary hardware (512MB RAM, late model PC running Windows XP SP2) for the task.

Evaluation Criteria: (1) The investigator shall have at least 5 years experience as a researcher in advanced technical applications for biomedical processing, and shall have demonstrable expertise (by conference and technical journal publications) in the areas of advanced image processing, including biomedical image segmentation; artificial neural networks and classification methods, and the application of such methods to the classification of biomedical pathology in human subjects; and hands-on software skills in MATLAB and C/C++. (2) The investigator shall have demonstrable expertise in the application of advanced image segmentation and classification techniques to the NHANES II digitized x-rays. (3) The investigator shall have access to at least two board certified medical experts in the field related to the topic of research..

The University of Missouri-Rolla is uniquely qualified for this work because of the expertise and experience of the principal investigator below (Dr. Joe Stanley) in the specific area of feature classification of digitized spine x-rays [1-4] and prior published work in color normalization for medical images [5-9], combined with his extensive educational background and experience in advanced image processing.

Principal Investigator: Dr. R. Joe Stanley is on the faculty of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Missouri-Rolla. Dr. Stanley is uniquely qualified for this work, based on his professional training and over 6 years experience in both academia and the private sector. Dr. Stanley was principal investigator for the image recognition program at Systems & Electronics, Inc. (SEI) in St. Louis, Missouri from May 1999 - July 2000. As principal investigator, he oversaw research and software development for postal and medical imaging-based systems, including systems to perform semi-automated human white blood cell differential counting and automated pill recognition. Dr. Stanley's work resulted in two patent applications. He completed his doctoral study at the University of Missouri-Columbia (UMC) under fellowships from the National Library of Medicine and the National Cancer Institute in a medical informatics training program. While at UMC, he received first and second place awards in student paper competitions at national conferences in 1998 and 1996, respectively, for his research in automated human chromosome image analysis. He also received the Outstanding Graduate Student Researcher Award from the Department of Computer Engineering and Computer Science at UMC in 1997. Dr. Stanley has demonstrated experience in successfully collaborating with medical experts. Specifically, in prior research projects (human chromosome image analysis and white blood cell image analysis), collaboration with a medical expert, i.e. pathologist, was used for data acquisition, data interpretation and technical expertise in algorithm development.

Presently, Dr. Stanley is investigating image processing and pattern recognition techniques in three research projects: (1) Image Processing and High-Throughput Microarray Data. Dr. Stanley serves as the principal investigator for this research project. His role is to develop algorithms for image registration and feature extraction to evaluate paired grayscale microarray images; (2) Multi-Modal NDE Development for Corrosion Detection and Analysis. This project builds on a number of recent SBIR programs as well as the Enhanced Equipment for Material Thinning (TCORR) and Structural Repair of Aging Aircraft (SRAA) programs to develop a multi-modal approach for corrosion detection. Dr. Stanley serves as principal investigator for the data fusion component for this project. His role is to develop algorithms for fusing multiple sensor information sources, including microwave, eddy current, and ultrasound to improve the detection and characterization of corrosion in sample structures; (3) Dermatology Image Analysis. Dr. Stanley collaborates with Dr. Randy Moss and Dr. William V. Stoecker at the University of Missouri-Rolla in the development of image processing and pattern recognition techniques to detect malignant melanoma in dermatology images. Dr. Stanley's contributions include the development of techniques to locate and remove hair from dermatology images and to locate and segment key dermatology image features for the detection of melanoma.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY – The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the National Association of State EMS Directors (NASEMSD), 201 Park Washington Court, Falls Church, VA  22046-4527. The Public Health Service Act, Title XII - Trauma Care, Section 1201, P.L. 101-590 authorizes HRSA to lead in the development of effective, comprehensive and inclusive statewide trauma systems. One of  HRSA’s roles is to highlight best practices and to create a model for State trauma systems. The purpose of this procurement is to provide HRSA (a) meeting time at The National Association of 	State EMS Directors Annual Meeting to showcase HRSA’s New Model Trauma Systems Planning and Evaluation (MTSPE) tool to State EMS Directors and State Trauma System 	Managers,(b)a model template for a State Trauma Plan based on the MTSPE,(c)written guidance on how a State can transition to the new plan. This Plan and Guidance will become the companion tool document for the MTSPE. In addition, this procurement will provide(d)a multidisciplinary meeting (12 total) of EMS directors, State Trauma Managers, and representatives from the ACS trauma system consultation process to discuss the MTSPE and review the draft MTSPE Template and Transition Guide. The NASEMSD will(e) offer for electronic view the revised draft MTSPE to the total NASEMSD membership and will provide(f)a final document incorporating comments.(g)The NASEMSD will offer the final MTSPE Template and Transition Guide to the total NASEMSD membership and will provide a (h) direct link from the NASEMSD website to the HRSA Trauma-EMS Systems Program website.(i)A final report will be due.
This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions. The period of performance for this project is one year. In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file. HRSA’s target audience is the Directors of State EMS programs and Trauma Systems Managers. The NASEMSD is the only national organization for EMS Directors and it has a membership that is made up of State EMS Directors. Most State Trauma Systems Managers report to the State EMS Directors, therefore the organization is uniquely positioned to disseminate information to the EMS community and to coordinate State EMS Managers in developing and accepting a universal EMS. In addition it is deemed the only source to complete all tasks because it is sponsoring a national meeting at which HRSA can buy presentation time to reach the correct audience, and it has proprietary rights to membership information to whom HRSA wishes to disseminate the new EMS tool for review and comment. 

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statement or proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Other factors impacting the Government's rights under a prospective lease, such as, the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.  Space must be situated in Cheshire within a two-mile radius of the confluence of Routes I-84 and I-691.

<DESC>The Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS), Little Rock, Arkansas, plans to negotiate a sole source contract with Louise E. Parker, PhD of Boulder, CO to obtain her services as a consultant in organizational behavior. The HSR&D Field Program is participating in the QUERI Service Directed Project MNT 03-215, entitled "Expanding and Testing VA Collaborative Care Models for Depression" (also known as ReTIDES). HSR&D will be studying 2 components of this project - (1) "Building and Evaluating an Organizational Bridge - Study Goal 2A" and (2)"Developing Readiness and Sustainability Tools - Study Goal 2C". These components will require the services of Dr. Louise Parker because of her prior role in the other VA QUERI studies leading to the ReTIDES study and her expertise in qualitative and quantitative social science techniques including ethnographic observation and interviewing, qualitative textual analysis, survey design and analysis, and experimental design and analysis. Dr. Parker has over 20 years of experience conducting qualitative studies of health care provider roles, attitudes, and behaviors. She was involved in the initial development of the collaborative care model. The Government believes that Dr. Parker is the only responsible source that can provide the service required because of her background and experience with the research project. Changing variables can interrupt the current research and could be detrimental to the work that has already been conducted regarding this project. The contract period will be from date of award through September 30, 2005 with two (2) one-year options. This announcement is a 100% small business set-aside, NAICS Code 62112, size standard $8.5 million.

<DESC>The VA Network 22 Logistics Office intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Charles River Labs, 251 Ballardvale St., Wilmington MA 01887, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition. Charles River shall provide specified strains and stocks of barrier reared and maintained rats and mice including, but not limited to the following: INBREAD LEWIS RATS VAF Female/Male in Grams, Sprague Dawley Rats Female Male VAF, Retired Breeders Littermates, Lactiating Rat with Litter, Inbred Rats - Fisher CDF Female/Male VAF. These mice and rats shall be supplied at the specified age, weight or sex, shipping and crates, or surgically altered as required for Gastroenterology Research as requested to meet the needs of the VA Long Beach Healthcare System investigators for ongoing research projects. The Contractor shall be regularly engaged in the breeding, raising, and shipping of the rats and mice. The rats and mice supplied under this contract shall be maintained in the Contractor's facilities. The Contractor shall be accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care or shall be eligible for accreditation. The period of performance will be for one twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for four (4) additional twelve (12) month periods. It is believed that Charles River is the sole source for this requirement because of the following: VA Long Beach Healthcare System investigators have established baseline research data using animals that were consistently obtained from Charles River. Deviations in the procedures used by different vendors to house, breed, feed, water, handle, monitor health, perform timed matings, ship, etc. result in production of animals that may slightly or significantly change response to different types of experimental manipulation. Furthermore, the cost to the Government to re-establish baseline data using mice and rats acquired from a different source would be prohibitive and potentially unsuccessful. Also, if another source were used to acquire animals for these studies, it would be necessary to duplicate some portions or all previously conducted studies, thus necessitating inappropriate utilization of greater numbers of animals. The North American Classified System Code is 112990, size standard $0.75M, will be used for this requirement. All proposals received by 4:00 PM Pacific Daylight Time, July 21, 2005, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquires will only be accepted by facsimile at (562)961-1378. See Numbered Note 22.

<CONTACT>Sheri' DellaSilva Contracting Officer 9077863436     sheri_dellasilva@fws.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Alaska Region, has the need for a wildland fire risk assessment for Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.  The Service would like to identify wildfire risks  to people, their communities and other resource values within and adjacent to Refuge land in Alaska by conducting a landscape level wildfire risk assessments on Alaska wildlife refuges that would include communities, private property, cultural  resources and Refuge infrastructure. A wildfire risk assessment would aid  in planning and implementing suppression actions, managing wildland fires for resource benefits and planning hazard reduction activities within or adjacent to refuge land. Contractor would develop a spatial representation of factors that influence the probability and consequences of wildfire within Alaska Wildlife Refuges.   This spatial probability and consequence rating for Refuges from wildland fire will be derived from analyzing  three major components: Ignition Probability, Fire Behavior and Suppression Response Capability. The final rating will incorporate values that are significant within Alaska Refuges: Ecosystem Integrity, Wildland Urban Interface/Intermix, Native Allotments and Cultural and Subsistence Resources and Air Quality. Individual ratings for each raster cell will be based on existing biophysical databases and the application of sub models (e.g. rate of fire spread calculated using the Canadian Fire Behavior Prediction System and spatial fuel inventory data).

Reference FAR Clause 52.246INSPECTION OF SUPPLIES FIXED(AUG 1996), paragraph (i) (1) AND (2), inspection of material to source sampling, the following clause titled: IDENTIFICATION OF QUALIFIED LABORATORY AND SOURCE SAMPLING is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this contract:

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSCPOL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                     ].

* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
	TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                  ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to schedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

(h)	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.	

Additional Requirements:

DPSCM 4155.3 TOXICITY REQUIREMENT - The contractor is responsible and must assure that all components are made from non-toxic materials.  The government reserves the right to verify that components are non-toxic in accordance with the following:

<DESC>This project will be accomplished through the use of a stewardship contract, which authorizes BLM to enter into a service contract allowing for the value of vegetative material removed to be applied as an offset against the cost of services received (Public Law 108-7).  The purpose of this hazardous fuel reduction project is to utilize a stewardship contract to create a fuel break around the LBC Messina Dr Submidision which is surrounded on three sides by Bureau of Land Management (BLM) managed land. The project objective is the creation of the fuel break would reduce stand densities enough that it would be difficult for the residual stand to support a crown fire.  The fuel break would also have down woody debris, slash and any ladder fuels removed to further aid in reducing fire rates of spread, intensity, and resistance to control.  Mechanical fuel reduction methods would be utilized to perform this work.  The treatments would be completed while protecting adjacent private structures and cultural resources located on federal land from damage or loss.  The project area is 43 acres of BLM managed land. Location of this project:  Lower Blackfoot Corridor, Messina Dr Subdivision, Missoula County, Montana.

<SUBJECT>A--FY 2005 NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (NRA) MOTIVATING UNDERGRADUATES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (MUST)
<SOLNBR>NNH05ZHH001N

<DESC>NASA Headquarters Office of Education, Higher Education Division, is releasing a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) soliciting proposals to help coordinate and administer the Motivating Undergraduates in Science and Technology (MUST) program. MUST is a competitive scholarship program intended to guide underrepresented and underserved U.S. students toward NASA-related science and engineering careers. The MUST program will provide tuition scholarships and funding for research opportunities to underrepresented and underserved U.S. citizens, enrolled in STEM disciplines at accredited institutions of higher education (university, college, or community college) degree programs of engineering and science.  MUST one-year competitive scholarships that are annually renewable for up to three years will be provided to second-year students who have committed to pursue studies in NASA related fields, and to a limited number of incoming first-year students who have successfully completed NASA research and education programs. As outlined in the Vision for Space Exploration, the NASA Strategic Plan, and the NASA Education Enterprise Strategy of 2003, a strategic goal of NASA’s mission is “to inspire and motivate students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.” MUST is a focused program to attract the “best and brightest” science and engineering students into the NASA workforce. By targeting students who are members of underrepresented and underserved groups, MUST addresses the critical shortfall of qualified minority scientists and engineers in the NASA workforce. The period of performance for the award resulting from this solicitation will last up to thirty-six (36) months.  The anticipated start date for these awards is September 30, 2005.  NASA expects to award one grant under this announcement.  The estimated annual value of award to an individual university or nonprofit organization is up to $2,000,000. This $2 M annual award must cover scholarship funding support of up to $10,000 per academic year per student participant and up to $6,000 per student participant annually to support NASA research experiences, including internships and/or other NASA research and education programs.  The $2 M of funding will also cover the MUST administrative costs identified by the proposing organization. Contingent on the availability of funds, progress, and continued relevance to the NASA mission, NASA anticipates continuing support at approximately similar funding levels through the first program cycle. Participation in this program is limited to educational institutions serving underrepresented students, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCU), and nonprofit institutions.  Partnerships among these educational and nonprofit institutions are strongly encouraged to apply.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for an upgrade to the existing dual RF, 24 channel GSS6560 GPS Simulator.	This system is required to be compatible with the existing test scenarios and test data generated as part of the GPS receiver test programs currently in progress at the Johnson Space Center.  This GPS Simulator shall provide a 48-channel configuration that allows for 12 L1 channels on each of 4 RF outputs.  Due to the fact that this GPS Simulator will be used in an integrated Guidance, Navigation, and Control hardware simulation, the capability to drive the GPS Simulator inputs from an external source will be required.  The RF signals produced by the GPS Simulator will be required to have user defined multipath error model parameters.	In addition to the multipath errors, Selective Availability, Ionosphere range biases, and Troposphere range biases errors also need to be produced as part of the signal generator output.   NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Spirent Federal Systems.  Due to the proprietary nature of the GPS Signal Generators design, Spirent Federal Systems is the only vendor authorized to perform hardware and software maintenance of the GSS6560 systems and no other supplies or services will satisfy agencey requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on July 14, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The expected result of this project is to mechanically alter fuel loadings on approximately 411 acres within pre-commercially thinned stands located on the Wallowa Valley Ranger District. The stands consist primarily of lodgepole and ponderosa pine species. The tree spacing ranges between 10 to 12 feet. Material to be treated is composed of pre-commerical thinning slash created between the years of 1997 to 2003. Trees thinned ranged in size from 18 inches tall up to the maximum cut DBH of 6 inches. Fuel amounts vary but are estimated at 0 to 2 feet in depth for a total of 5-10 tons/acre. This material is identified as fuel model 11 as defined by the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report, PNW-52 1976.  Treatment units are located on all aspects and located between 4200 feet and 5000 feet elevation. Treatment unit slope varies from 0 to 30% with an approximate average of 15%.

<RESPDATE>072205
<ARCHDATE>08222005
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 421490   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a  written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The current NAICS code is 423490 for this requirement. (the previous NAICS code from 1997 was 421490, which is also listed in the synopsis).  The specifications for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) are as  follows:    Synopsis: An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an advanced technology, multipurpose swimming robot that can effectively measure environmental parameters used to access ecological health and species-habitat interactions in aquatic environments.  AUVs  can be configured with a  variety of sensor packages to measure water quality, with video cameras to map habitats and biota (e.g. shellfish), and with side scan sonar to acoustically image seabed properties in both shallow and deep environments. This instrument will be a key component in a variety of research projects at  AED in the Habitat Effects Branch, which currently is conducting research in support of the Aquatic Stressors Framework's plan for Altered Habitat Research and focuses on coastal marshes, estuaries, and near shore habitats at the scale of habitat elements and habitat mosaics up to and including  entire coastal ecosystems.   The Aquatic Stressors Framework states that spatial habitat mapping will be a "vital tool" in application of the stressor-response models, and thus habitat mapping of shorelines, lakes, estuaries, and sub-estuaries should be a part of the quantitative research involved  in creating the models.  AUVs are ideal tools for assessing and mapping habitats and biota over large spatial scales and at speeds comparable to the rate processes of interest.  By outfitting the AUV with a video camera, side scan sonar unit, CTD and dissolved oxygen probe, real-time measurements  of habitat quality and quantity (e.g. bottom topography, presence of shellfish beds, dissolved oxygen levels, stratification, seagrass bed areal extent and level of patchiness) can be collected relatively rapidly.  The habitat and biota data collected by the AUV will be essential for ground  truthing, over large spatial scales, the habitat alteration (stressor)-species response models and habitat suitability indices currently under development by the Habitat Effects Branch.  This instrument will contribute to research that will (1) synthesize habitat quantity, quality, or arrangement  (stressors), and (2) quantitatively relate these habitat alteration stressors to fish, shellfish, or wildlife (responses), thus supporting the Altered Habitat Research Plan's APM 5 (Report characterizing relationships of between abundance, quality, and arrangement of various habitat types ad  selected biotic assessment endpoints in coastal systems) and APM 6 (Synthesized quantitative species-habitat relationships suitable for developing regional habitat-based bio-criteria for shorelines, lakes and estuaries).  As dissolved oxygen level is an assessment endpoint for the Watershed  Diagnostics Branch, the AUV, equipped with the fast-response dissolved oxygen sensor, will be a valuable research tool for this branch as well (APM- Report on the sensitivity of food web responses to nutrient loading coastal systems). In addition, the potential exists for the AUV to be used as a  tool for large scale monitoring and assessment efforts in a range of habitats in support of the Coastal Assessment (Goal 8) and Aquatic Stressors (Goal 2) research efforts. Furthermore, we can conceive potential uses of the AUV at Gulf Ecology Division (GED), Mid-Continent Ecology Division (MED),  Western Ecology Division (WED) and by EPA regions and partners.   General Specifications: o	The AUV must be easily lifted by two people, deployable from a small-craft or from shore, and therefore must be small and light (see specific specifications list). o	The AUV must be modular in design  allowing simple assembly and disassembly and be comprised mainly of commercial off-the-shelf components. o	All of the source code for the AUV's instrumentation control and navigation software, and detailed schematics of all electronic circuits must be provided to enable field troubleshooting.  A  troubleshooting guide is also required. o	The modular hull sections must be lightweight and constructed of materials immune or highly resistant to corrosion.  All pressure containers must be sealed with o-rings. o	The AUV must be fully operational in water temperatures ranging from -1.6?C to 35?C  and remain unharmed for storage, and operational for testing in air temperatures ranging from -10?C to 45?C.   o	A connection to the central processing computer must be externally available through an underwater connector. o	A graphical user interface (GUI) must be provided for planning of safe  mission waypoints and to monitor the mission progress.

<SUBJECT>35--Remove and Replace Existing Variable Temperature Shed (VT Shed) Door
<SOLNBR>RFQ-OH-05-00141
<RESPDATE>072505
<ARCHDATE>08252005
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Tharp, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2092
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Richmond Instruments & Systems, Inc. for Removal and Replacement of an existing Variable Temperature Shed (VT Shed) Door under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   Variable Temperature SHEDs are required to be sealed well enough to retain 97 to 103% of a 2 to 6 gram injection of propane after a 22 to 35 deg C cooling and heating temperature trace over a 24 hour period.   The existing VT SHED has a  guillotine type door with inflatable seals between the door's inside surface and the SHED.   This design allows the seal to press the door away from the SHED itself.  Because of minor alignment tolerances of the original door frame installation, approximately 14 years ago, the existing door has  been irreparably warped about a 0.25 to 0.50 inch by the pressure of the inflatable seals and the SHED can no longer pass the Federal Register +/- 3% retention requirements.   Richmond Instruments will remove the existing door, seal and frame.  They will dispose of the existing 1000 lb. door along  with the guillotine frame, saving the electric motors, the inflatable seal and hardware from the door, if possible.  They will then install the new VT Shed Door and mechanically seal.  Finally they will integrate a new "outer rim seal" door with the SHEDs existing software controls and safety  interlocking software and prove the SHEDs capability to pass Federal Register Variable Temperature SHED calibration requirements and perform FR Variable Temperature Evaporative Emission tests. It has been determined that Richmond Instruments is the only firm able to remove and replace the existing  VT Shed Door since they are the original manufacturer.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the services of removal and replacement of the VT Shed Door may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  Such  documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be  considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

<SOLNBR>RFQ-OH-05-00142
<RESPDATE>072205
<ARCHDATE>08222005
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 421490   Minimum Specifications for Mobile, High Speed Foyer Transform In-Fared (FT-IR) Spectrometer This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information  included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The current NAICS code is 423490 for this requirement. (the previous NAICS code from 1997 was 421490, which is also listed in the synopsis).  The  specifications for the Mobile, High Speed Foyer Transform In-Fared (FT-IR) Spectrometer are as follows:   Background: One of the primary missions of the Landscape Characterization Branch (LCB) of the National Exposure Research Laboratory's Environmental Science Division (NERL-ESD) is the research  in advanced remote sensing technologies for environmental monitoring and characterization. NERL-ESD has a role to test and validate these technologies against a variety of applications, including: o	Biomass burning emission characterization and chemical speciation. o	Characterize emissions from  industrial chemical plants and CAFOs in support of regional clients such as Air Permitting and Planning divisions. o	Research in emission fluxes from CAFO, municipal landfills, and waste treatment facilities. o	Validation of data obtained by earth observing remote sensing satellites, such as the  NASA EOS systems. o	Homeland security related events including: o	emergency response to accidental releases or a terrorist release of chemical or biological agent - the library of chemical candidates includes all known chemical and biological agents.  Sampling of gaseous emissions is a difficult  task that is often dangerous to implement and the results uncertain due to the sampling instruments and protocols involved. Emission sources are often in hazardous areas and are hard to access for sampling or sensor placement. Emergency responses to chemical releases require real-time analysis and  reporting, which is often not achievable using direct sampling techniques. Stand-off sensing technologies allow for remote sensing of chemical emissions from distances up to 1km and beyond in some cases. Recent advances in sensor technologies including miniaturization have produced very accurate  systems that can discriminate thousands of chemical species in real time without active illumination sources or specialized reflectors. These systems are relatively easy to use and are very portable, requiring only small amounts of liquid nitrogen for cooling. The system proposed on this request  can be configured to collect data from airborne platforms such as helicopter, or on the ground using a telescope lens. Minimum Specifications: The requirements for this order consist of the design and development of a  fast-scanning and portable FT-IR spectrometer system. The system is required  to be a highly portable FT-IR spectrometer capable of calibrated absolute emissivity measurements, and is proven in rugged geophysical and remote sensing applications. The system shall consist of a small compact packaging, rugged and reliable performance, and low power consumption. This mobile,  high speed FT-IR spectrometer has to be capable of deployment on fixed wing aircraft, or a helicopter platform.  The contractor will need to provide a proven design and be able to demonstrate successful remote detection of chemical plume species under a variety of environments. 1.   Computer and  Sensor: The spectrometer shall be integrated with a computer for system control and data analysis. The computer shall be capable of running all spectrometer control functions as well as being able to performing data analysis operations. The integrated computer shall enable housing of the A/D board  within the unit and provide a ready-to-go portable workstation, including the keyboard and display. The entire system shall be able to run on standard wall power and also use a 12 volts supply and inverter adequate for the power consumption requirements. 2.  Detector: The detector shall be a  single pixel LN2 cooled two-color InSb/MCT detector. 3.  Blackbody Calibrator:  An on-board warm/cold blackbody will be incorporated into the system, to enable on-the-fly calibration of the instrument.  This blackbody shall be between the interferometer and the outward looking telescope. 4.    Fore-Optics and Sighting: The system shall have a 4" diameter Cassegrain type telescope which shall provide a 1.2? field of view (FOV). At a standoff distance of one kilometer this shall be able to provide targeting of an area approximately 21 meters in diameter. The telescope shall include,  through-the-lens viewing for boresighting. 5.  Software:  The following levels described shall also be provided in this deliverable: Level 1:  Acquire Sample and Reference Data and Subtract or Ratio. This shall give a raw spectrum of the species of interest with the background removed.  If the  Radiance was not used for the Sample and Reference data before the background removal, the software shall have the ability to use the blackbody to measure the instrument transfer function and to produce radiance measurements. Level 2:  Correlation of Level 1 Measured Spectrum with a Known "Target"  Spectrum.  A calibration of the instrument transfer function is needed for target species with broad peaks or with multiple peaks in order to derive radiance values. Spectral detection algorithms are performed on Radiance rather than on raw intensity data. The software shall possess a technique to  correlate these with the use of internal blackbodies measurements to an external blackbody. Orthogonal Subspace Projection (OSP) will be used to remove from 3 - 6 backgrounds from a sample scan. OSP addresses the issue of "known" backgrounds.  The OSP algorithm shall allow for the specification of  several backgrounds at once. All items shall be delivered to the U.S. EPA, 109 TW Alexander Dr., RTP, NC 2771 no later than 120 days after award.  FOB point shall be destination.  The following clauses apply to this request for quote:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items;  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items, and the specific evaluation criteria is as follows: (1) Technical acceptability of the item offered to meet the Government's requirement and (2) Technical acceptability shall be evaluated on a pass or fail basis.  Offers shall provide descriptive technical  literature in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the items offered meet the minimum requirements specified above;  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations & Certifications- Commercial Items, shall be completed by offeror and submitted with quote, unless the offeror's registered with CCR; FAR  52.212-4, Contract terms & Conditions- Commercial Items;  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms & Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-MILSATCOM-72
<RESPDATE>092004
<CONTACT>Charles Briggs, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 336-4748, Fax (310) 336-4075, Email charles.briggs@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Joint Program Office (MJPO) intends to acquire continuing MILSATCOM space communications support for Fiscal Year 2005 in general systems engineering, simulation and modeling, analysis tools maintenance and upgrades, and systems integration.  The currently envisioned effort is primarily for the secure/survivable Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite program and required interfacing systems. AEHF is the follow-on to the Milstar system, which augments and improves on Milstar capabilities and expands the MILSATCOM architecture to enable Transformational Communications and Network-Centric Warfare. Contracted effort shall provide general systems engineering support for the AEHF program, including ongoing efforts in the areas of design, development, test, computer simulation/verification, manufacturing, and integration of the AEHF system. Contracted effort shall include support for AEHF backward compatibility requirements and related operational issues on Milstar; the payload subsystem; payload-to-terminal interface requirements, including acquisition and tracking, access control protocols, resource management, and assured access; information assurance concepts, including the key management plan and architecture, key authentication, key distribution, AEHF COMSEC/TRANSEC System products/schedule/issues, and cryptographic key management for test assets; foreign disclosure related tasks to support the International Partners, including redaction of technical documents, processing and coordination of foreign disclosure material; verification, system test, and test program coordination; AEHF training; Milstar-to-AEHF transition and concept of operations development; and advanced studies and concept development. Contracted effort shall maintain and upgrade the AEHF MILSATCOM End-to-End Simulation Environment (AEHF MEESE) software/hardware tools, developed by LinQuest Corporation under Air Force contract F04707-98-C-0046 and Army CECOM GSA contract GS-35F-0357-J, and potentially the Milstar MEESE. The contractor shall update AEHF MEESE software, firmware and hardware to emulate AEHF payload and terminal designs. The contracted effort shall add new functionality required to perform system-level analyses supporting systems engineering activities, such as system performance evaluations of end-to-end satellite links, adaptive antenna performance, independent verification of system capabilities to provide confidence for sell-off of system communications performance requirements, system anomaly resolution and impact assessment studies, and proof of concept demonstrations for advanced studies and concept development. Contracted effort shall provide systems integration to ensure an independent systems integration assessment is conducted for the end-to-end MILSATCOM systems. Systems integration will include, but not be limited to, the Space Segment, Command and Control Segment, terminal cryptographic and key products suppliers, acceptance and testing organizations, and war fighter end users requirements. Effort will include analysis of system interdependencies, development and delivery of integrated system schedules, technical compliance analyses, analysis of interface control documentation, test planning and reports, and briefings. The effort will also include the development of a systems integration process description and a risk management framework, and support to end-to-end inter-segment systems engineering, system level requirements allocation and configuration control, systems level verification and validation, and system security engineering. Extensive systems engineering experience, knowledge, and background dealing with DoD-specific capabilities in the EHF secure satellite communications field and a minimum Government security clearance of Secret are mandatory. Familiarity and experience working with DoD customers, to include the Air Force Space Command, MJPO, Army, Navy, and Air Force Terminal Program Offices (TPOs), is required to resolve terminal to payload requirements issues. Training in international programs security requirements and international security and technology transfer/control; familiarity with National Disclosure Policy (NDP-1), the Air Force Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letter (DDL), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR); and experience in processing Exemptions to the ITAR and the process of formulating Technical Assistance Agreements (TAAs) between US contractors and foreign governments and their contractors is required. This program effort is an extension of the MILSATCOM support contract currently being performed by LinQuest Corporation, a small business. It is anticipated that only the incumbent contractor has sufficient relevant experience to meet the requirements of this acquisition. This notice is primarily intended for subcontracting opportunities. However, interested parties must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) 10 calendar days after this announcement is posted, demonstrating knowledge in the requirements areas described above. The SOC shall not exceed 10 pages in length. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute a RFP. The Government will not recognize any direct costs associated with submission of a SOC. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the type of procurement. Submit all responses to: SMC/MCK, Attn: Charles Briggs, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467 A-8, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659. The period of performance is one year from 1 Oct 04 to 30 Sep 05. The Government's ROM estimate for this work is $5.2M. Government-wide numbered notes 22 and 26 apply. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman for the Space and Missiles Systems Center is Mr. Patrick Devine, SMC/DS, at (310) 363-3571.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>W912P6-05-Q-0018
<RESPDATE>071405
<ARCHDATE>09122005
<CONTACT>Linda L. Zamarocy, 312-846-5374
<DESC>By way of this notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announces its intention to award a sole source contract to National Audubon Society (NAS)/Chicago Region for planning recommendations for th e restoration of grassland bird habitat at the Orland Tract of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County.   The work consists of the preparation of plant community maps and maps of the 2005 nesting locations of grassland birds, the description of 2 alternative plans and the identification of a preferred plan that includes a recommended species lists for planting , development of alternatives, an invasive species removal plan, and mapping. NAS/Chicago Region is uniquely qualified to prepare a vegetation/grassland bird restoration plan for the site.  No private sector organizations have attempted this type of project in the region.  NAS/Chicago Region recently completed the planning and imple mentation of a revegetation project at a nearby mile-square site, Bartel Grasslands, which supports many of the above species.  Numbers of nesting grassland birds increased notably since the project.  At Spring Creek Valley Forest Preserve a NAS/Chicago Re gion project is underway and a number of rare species have already returned.  The director of the organization designed and supervised the successful 1,000-acre vegetation and grassland bird restoration at Nachusa Grassland in his earlier position as Scien ce Director at The Nature Conservancy/Illinois.   They are the only group available that has knowledge and experience in the combination of the restoration of native vegetation to sites in the Chicago region with the restoration of habitat for these very s ensitive, legally protected, bird species.  Orland Tract has Land & Water Reserve Status under the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission, which offers stringent legal protection.  There is also considerable interest in the site and any restoration activitie s from concerned and active stakeholders that include birders, site volunteers, and the City of Orland.  Work there, including surveys and mapping, must receive a permit from the forest Preserve District of cook County as the owners and managers of the sit e.  National Audubon Society/Chicago Region has been granted the requisite permits because of field investigations performed on the site over the last 3 years.  Earlier efforts by governmental agencies to restore habitat for these species have had limited success.  It is thought that incorrect vegetation structure may have been the cause.  For these reasons NAS is the one responsible source who can satisfy our agencies requirements. The performance period is for approximately 18 months.  It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a firm-fixed priced Purchase Order.  This notice is NOT a Request for Quotations; therefore NO solicitation documents will be issued.  Award is an ticipated on or about July 15, 2005. The Point of contact for this contractusl action is Linda Zamarocy, Contract Specialist at Telephone Number (312) 846-5374 or Fax Number (312) 886-5475.

<DESC>This modification to the previous announcement changes the dates as indicated in this revised announcement (only the dates are changed).  The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Woods Hole, MA has a requirement for fishery observer services. The Contractor shall collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data at sea through interviews of vessels captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear and collection of samples. Data collected includes data on the vessel, crew, fishing practices and cost of operation. This data is necessary for the management of fisheries occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas beyond the EEZ. The work requires deploying trained NEFSC certified observers to meet coverage levels prescribed in sea day schedules developed by NMFS/NEFSC.  NEFSC will train the contractor’s observers once the contract is awarded as needed and at the Government’s expense.  The Contractor shall support, as specified, the observers during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy observers to ports from which fishing vessels depart. This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for observers, reimbursing vessel operators for observer meals, and reimbursing observers for travel expenses. Vessels operate out of ports from North Carolina to Maine in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions. Typically, trips are 1- 5 days in duration. Vessels are generally 30-100 feet in length. Crew members and observers live and sleep in close quarters, often in damp conditions and share common facilities. Because of the size of the vessels, motion sickness can be debilitating for some individuals. Observers must be willing to travel occasionally to cover locations other than their home ports.  The Government estimates 12,000 sea days per year.  The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract.  The contract award date is anticipated to be November 1, 2005 with a period of performance of five (5) years thereafter.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation will be available on or about August 1, 2005 through the Government’s website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  The estimated due date for proposals is September 15, 2005.  A preproposal conference and site visit, if determined to be necessary, will be conducted at NEFSC Woods Hole, MA on or about August  18, 2005.  The basis for proposal evaluation will include, in descending order of importance:  Technical Requirements, Past Performance, Corporate Experience, and Key Personnel, and technical, when combined, is significantly more important than price.  This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6 million.  This acquisition is being conducted using FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items and Part 15 – Contracting by Negotiation.  Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps register to receive notification feature which provides notification when the RFP becomes available for download and all postings associated with the solicitation.  Each potential offeror is responsible for checking this website to gain all the updates/amendments to any and all documents.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.  No telephone, facsimile, or written requests will be accepted.  All responsible, responsive sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Agency.  Questions regarding this solicitation should be address to Lynne.B.Phipps@noaa.gov.  See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>This Amendment to Pre-Solicitation Notice FA7000-05-R-0025 is hereby issued to acknowledge that the solicitation will be issued as an RFQ vs. a formal RFP.  Due to internal system errors, an "R-type" solicitation number for RFP vs. a "T-type" solicitation number for RFQ was initiated.  However, this is not accurate and this amendment is issued to correct that misconception.  A letter RFP will not be issued.  Instead, an SF 1449 RFQ FA7000-05-T-0123 will be issued in its place.  All steps and procedures are in compliance and accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR Part 12 and 13.  


The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a sole source commercial purchase order to Agilent Technologies, Inc.  The requirement is to replace the eleven [11] year old LC/GC/Mass Spectrometer for the Chemistry Department at USAFA CO.  The Department of Chemistry has an important need for an ESI/MALDI LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System to meet the requirements of large molecule inorganics or organometalics, nonvolatile molecules and protein/peptide analysis in advanced chemistry courses and work being done in the chemistry research center.  Time-of-flight mass spectrometry [TOF MS] was developed in the last 1940’s, but until the 1990’s, its popularity was limited.  Recent improvements in TOF technology, including orthogonal acceleration, ion mirrors [reflections], and high-speed electronics, have significantly improved TOF resolution.  This improved resolution, combined with powerful and easy-to-use electrospray [ESI] and matrix-assister laser desorption ionization [MALDI] ion sources, have made TOF MS a core technology for the analysis of both small and large molecules.  Most of the introductory organic or analytical chemistry courses work with volatile organic compounds that can easily be analyzed on Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometers [GCMS.  As chemistry courses advance into courses such as Biochemistry, Macro Biochemistry and Materials Science studies larger and more complex molecules are studied.  To work with these large molecules, a new type of sample introduction process is needed to transfer, separate and inject Liquid Chromatography [LC] into a mass spectrometer [TOF MS].  As well as being an extremely sensitive detection system [TOF MS] can separate large proteins and peptides, like RNA and DNA for example.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 421490   Minimum Specifications for Mobile, High Speed Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FT-IR) Spectrometer This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional  information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The current NAICS code is 423490 for this requirement. (the previous NAICS code from 1997 was 421490, which is also listed in the synopsis).  The  specifications for the Mobile, High Speed Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FT-IR) Spectrometer are as follows:   Background: One of the primary missions of the Landscape Characterization Branch (LCB) of the National Exposure Research Laboratory's Environmental Science Division (NERL-ESD) is the  research in advanced remote sensing technologies for environmental monitoring and characterization. NERL-ESD has a role to test and validate these technologies against a variety of applications, including: o	Biomass burning emission characterization and chemical speciation. o	Characterize  emissions from industrial chemical plants and CAFOs in support of regional clients such as Air Permitting and Planning divisions. o	Research in emission fluxes from CAFO, municipal landfills, and waste treatment facilities. o	Validation of data obtained by earth observing remote sensing satellites,  such as the NASA EOS systems. o	Homeland security related events including: o	emergency response to accidental releases or a terrorist release of chemical or biological agent - the library of chemical candidates includes all known chemical and biological agents.  Sampling of gaseous emissions is a  difficult task that is often dangerous to implement and the results uncertain due to the sampling instruments and protocols involved. Emission sources are often in hazardous areas and are hard to access for sampling or sensor placement. Emergency responses to chemical releases require real-time  analysis and reporting, which is often not achievable using direct sampling techniques. Stand-off sensing technologies allow for remote sensing of chemical emissions from distances up to 1km and beyond in some cases. Recent advances in sensor technologies including miniaturization have produced  very accurate systems that can discriminate thousands of chemical species in real time without active illumination sources or specialized reflectors. These systems are relatively easy to use and are very portable, requiring only small amounts of liquid nitrogen for cooling. The system proposed on  this request can be configured to collect data from airborne platforms such as helicopter, or on the ground using a telescope lens. Minimum Specifications: The requirements for this order consist of the design and development of a  fast-scanning and portable FT-IR spectrometer system. The system  is required to be a highly portable FT-IR spectrometer capable of calibrated absolute emissivity measurements, and is proven in rugged geophysical and remote sensing applications. The system shall consist of a small compact packaging, rugged and reliable performance, and low power consumption. This  mobile, high speed FT-IR spectrometer has to be capable of deployment on fixed wing aircraft, or a helicopter platform.  The contractor will need to provide a proven design and be able to demonstrate successful remote detection of chemical plume species under a variety of environments. 1.    Computer and Sensor: The spectrometer shall be integrated with a computer for system control and data analysis. The computer shall be capable of running all spectrometer control functions as well as being able to performing data analysis operations. The integrated computer shall enable housing of  the A/D board within the unit and provide a ready-to-go portable workstation, including the keyboard and display. The entire system shall be able to run on standard wall power and also use a 12 volts supply and inverter adequate for the power consumption requirements. 2.  Detector: The detector  shall be a single pixel LN2 cooled two-color InSb/MCT detector. 3.  Blackbody Calibrator:  An on-board warm/cold blackbody will be incorporated into the system, to enable on-the-fly calibration of the instrument.  This blackbody shall be between the interferometer and the outward looking  telescope. 4.   Fore-Optics and Sighting: The system shall have a 4" diameter Cassegrain type telescope which shall provide a 1.2? field of view (FOV). At a standoff distance of one kilometer this shall be able to provide targeting of an area approximately 21 meters in diameter. The telescope  shall include, through-the-lens viewing for boresighting. 5.  Software:  The following levels described shall also be provided in this deliverable: Level 1:  Acquire Sample and Reference Data and Subtract or Ratio. This shall give a raw spectrum of the species of interest with the background  removed.  If the Radiance was not used for the Sample and Reference data before the background removal, the software shall have the ability to use the blackbody to measure the instrument transfer function and to produce radiance measurements. Level 2:  Correlation of Level 1 Measured Spectrum with  a Known "Target" Spectrum.  A calibration of the instrument transfer function is needed for target species with broad peaks or with multiple peaks in order to derive radiance values. Spectral detection algorithms are performed on Radiance rather than on raw intensity data. The software shall  possess a technique to correlate these with the use of internal blackbodies measurements to an external blackbody. Orthogonal Subspace Projection (OSP) will be used to remove from 3 - 6 backgrounds from a sample scan. OSP addresses the issue of "known" backgrounds.  The OSP algorithm shall allow  for the specification of several backgrounds at once. All items shall be delivered to the U.S. EPA, 109 TW Alexander Dr., RTP, NC 2771 no later than 120 days after award.  FOB point shall be destination.  The following clauses apply to this request for quote:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to  Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items, and the specific evaluation criteria is as follows: (1) Technical acceptability of the item offered to meet the Government's requirement and (2) Technical acceptability shall be evaluated on a pass or fail basis.  Offers shall  provide descriptive technical literature in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the items offered meet the minimum requirements specified above;  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations & Certifications- Commercial Items, shall be completed by offeror and submitted with quote, unless the offeror's  registered with CCR; FAR 52.212-4, Contract terms & Conditions- Commercial Items;  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms & Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.

Description
DESC: This amendment to Request for Information (RFI) Reference-Number-AFCA11005200 is intended to clarify the previous RFI.  Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  The government is currently conducting a market survey and analysis of government-off-the shelf and commercial-off-the shelf products that can meet the requirements for the Air Force Enterprise Information Technology Service (AF EITS) Storage initiative.  This effort is part of the Air Forces Net-Centric Computing initiative.

Documents mentioned in the previous RFI cannot be released at this time and will not provide any additional insight to answering the RFI questions below.  The subject documents either belong to another agency, are For Official Use Only, or are haven't been approved yet.  This RFI is simply a barometer to determine if our architecture is in line with industry projections for the future.  This architecture will be the basis of all future storage solutions, Requests for Proposals and Statements of Work.

To clarify the Air Force's DESIRED END STATE, we are targeting a Global Air Force Storage Capability that: 

1. Virtualizes storage
2. Supports a heterogeneous vendor environment

Technical POC/Program Manager, Mr. Jonathan C. Gregory, AFRL/IFEC, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-4294, email:    Jonathan.Gregory@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of information and sensor data analysis technology and associated sensors that will overcome deficiencies and enhance capabilities in existing and planned systems that support law enforcement and corrections efforts and the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center Northeast (NLECTC-NE.) The NLECTC-NE's mission is to work with government, industry, and academia to identify, evaluate, develop, demonstrate, and assess technology applications for law enforcement and corrections agencies. These efforts include, but are not limited to, concealed weapons detection, audio processing, video surveillance, facial recognition, timeline analysis, communications, communications and information systems interoperability, command and control, mobile and wireless computing, computer forensics, cyber crime, digital evidence handling, school safety, Integrated Border Enforcement Team (IBET), information management, and information storage, retrieval and exploitation. High level overviews of areas of interest for this BAA are in the following paragraphs.  Concealed Weapons Detection (CWD) using either active or passive sensors is a priority for military personnel performing peacekeeping missions, law enforcement officers, and security personnel. Of interest are low cost technologies that can provide portable concealed weapons detection to include weapons with little or no metal content and explosives. Technology which could perform this at a standoff distances of at least ten meters and/or operate autonomously for weapons screening is also of interest.  Also of interest are technologies to perform Through the Wall Surveillance (TWS) and Personnel Location and Tracking (PL&T).  This includes the ability to detect, track and identify moving and stationary targets through building materials and rubble in the case of Urban Search and Rescue (US&R).  Technology development may include those generate a floor plan from outside of a structure as well.  The development of audio processing technologies to allow speaker identification, elimination of noise and/or multiple voices, enhancement and identification of background noise. Video surveillance technologies and tools to enable the acquisition, processing, storage, and enhancement of video data to support law enforcement activities, e.g., facial recognition, identification of individuals, vehicles, events, and interactions.  Timeline analysis technologies to provide both pattern/trend analysis for investigations, and to enhance logistics and planned coverage of regions for increased effectiveness of law enforcement resources. Timeline analysis tools to allow the user multiple customizable ways to display location, time, interaction and event data.  Communications research, development and demonstration of voice and data communications for public safety applications. Communications support voice, data, and "broadband" data (such as real-time video, geographic/map data and overlays, etc.), and can be transmitted via landline, radio frequencies, and/or microwave frequencies, both clear and encrypted. Mobile and wireless computing to provide a local data processing capability giving those in the field users a more responsive and interactive data accessing environment.  Geographic information tools and technologies are increasingly important for law enforcement in coordinating the response of resource and in the analysis of data and discovery of trends/patterns. Geospatial systems integrated into communications networks would assist command and control capabilities by directing messages to those elements which where able to effectively respond. For example, it could increase efficiency by providing information to those who need it, while filtering irrelevant information.  Interoperability is a key element of law enforcement/public safety operations. It is the ability to share/disseminate information to those who need it without impediments created by differing systems, offices, or organizations. Research and analysis of interoperability issues are critical to address early on to provide roadmaps for development and implementation which reduces the conflicts experienced when interfacing with dissimilar systems.  Enhancement of communications systems is an area of interest in this BAA. Communications systems can include private land mobile radio (LMR) systems, commercial services, and/or specialized systems such as wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and satellite communications. Advanced technologies including, but not limited to, software defined radios, voice over IP (VoIP), wireless LAN, 3G wireless data, ultra wideband communications, and mesh networks have the potential to significantly enhance law enforcement and public safety communications; part of this effort is to accelerate the process of transferring these technologies to the law enforcement/public safety market.  Computer Forensics, Cyber-crime: Perform applied research and prototype development in the digital forensic sciences for mission time-critical needs of military and civilian operational networks with spin-offs for the statute-driven law enforcement approach. Explore and apply scientifically proven methods to gather, process, and interpret digital evidence to 1) describe cyber-attack activities, enabling post-attack critical information data and infrastructure restoration, 2) correlate, interpret, and predict adversarial actions and their impact on military operations, and 3) ensure digital data scenario evidence has provable integrity appropriate for military defensive and offensive operations and, possibly, criminal investigations.  Information storage, management, retrieval, and exploitation are technologies that law enforcement, corrections, criminal justice, and public safety agencies increasingly rely upon. The information must be maintained securely while still allowing timely access and updating by multiple agencies/organizations. These systems also need to go types beyond the traditional text based systems to encompass additional and new data types, e.g. audio, video, geospatial. These systems must be able to integrate into the modern computing/networked environment.  Assessments of state-of-the-art of the technologies above will be performed and provided for law enforcement and corrections agencies. Technology demonstrations/evaluations will be accomplished in a real world environment.  Best practices and lessons learned of those evaluations will be fed back to technology development programs and disseminated to the criminal justice community.  In some cases, AFRL Rome may be able to provide further information. Contact the technical POC. The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to five (5) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution.

<DESC>Task Title:
Evaluating Access to MEDLINE® via Handheld Computers in the Clinical Setting.

Background:
Medline Database on Tap (MD on Tap) is a research project of the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine. The first test bed and freely available public client software were released in May 2003.  The MD on Tap project seeks to discover design principles for the delivery of on-line information to mobile healthcare providers at the point-of-care via wireless handheld computers. 

Healthcare providers, especially younger clinicians, residents and medical students, are increasingly adopting the use of handheld computers for access to a variety of information sources. The handheld computer hardware, operating systems, peripherals, communications and input modalities are all in flux, with each new generation of device boasting improved performance and usability.  Providers of online information resources, such as NLM with its MEDLINE database, need to employ well-founded design principles to effectively serve mobile healthcare providers over the wide and changing handheld computer platforms available. 

The MD on Tap system consists of client applications for Palm and Pocket PC wireless (802.11b/g compatible) handheld computers. These applications support real-time search of and retrieval from MEDLINE. The clients communicate over the Internet with an intermediate http server that communicates with the National Library of Medicine’s PubMed via the entrez e-utilities to execute MEDLINE searches and retrieve citation data. The intermediate server records de-identified transactions received from clients. Through analysis of these stored transactions we have learned several aspects of aggregate user behavior regarding searching MEDLINE with a small device. However, the analysis does not fully relate the query terms and retrieved citations to the clinical scenario being addressed. Careful manual examination can occasionally infer the clinical question being asked, but with insufficient confidence to determine if the question was answered by the citations retrieved. 

Purpose of this contract task:
The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to extend the research work of the MD on Tap project by conducting a structured evaluation of the MD on Tap system through real-time use of the system in a clinical environment in which many questions are raised at the point-of-care. NLM is interested in knowing the clinical scenario in which questions arise, the nature of the clinical questions that arise, the occurrence of MEDLINE citations that address those questions and the ability of the MD on Tap system to assist the clinician to quickly find relevant, high quality MEDLINE citations at the point-of-care.

Description of Services:
NLM expects to secure the services of a trained medical doctor (hereafter referred to as a medical practitioner or practitioner) with access to a variety of clinical care environments in a teaching hospital that has wireless Internet access via an 802.11b/g compatible networked infrastructure on most of the wards, for a ten week process evaluation and technology assessment of the use of handheld computers (or “PDA”s) by clinicians in their ability to provide real-time information at the point-of-care. The practitioner is also expected to have access to and some familiarity with wireless PDAs using either the Palm Operating System or the Pocket PC operating System. These elements are necessary for the desired explicit evaluation of the use of a handheld computer application, MD on Tap (for Medline Database on Tap), for real-time access to MEDLINE to answer clinical questions raised at the bedside, evaluation of the ability of the MD on Tap application to be an effective interface to MEDLINE in clinical settings, and evaluation of the role of MEDLINE in answering such questions. The successful contractor will provide the combination of all of the stated elements. The combination of all the elements is necessary. A clinical care environment in a teaching hospital is necessary to insure an environment in which a variety of clinical questions are likely to arise at the point-of-care. A trained medical practitioner with broad medical expertise is required to describe the clinical scenario, recognize the clinical question and be able to categorize it by Evidence Based Medicine category, generate a suitable MEDLINE query using the MD on Tap PDA client application, and identify MEDLINE citations that address the clinical question within the bounds of the clinical scenario. Wireless Internet access in most of the hospital wards at the bedside is necessary to support real-time use of the MD on Tap application, which requires wireless access to the Internet. The 802.11b/g LAN is required to insure sufficient communication bandwidth for fast interaction between the wireless PDA and the NLM servers. Wireless PDAs with either the Palm OS Operating System or the Pocket PC Operating System are required to support the MD on Tap client application. In addition, the successful contractor will be responsible for providing the medical practitioner and the teaching hospital with an IT support person(s) dedicated at least part time solely to support wireless PDA operation and network connectivity related issues.


Review and Award Process:
The review and award process will follow a two-step process: 1. A Request for Information (RFI) - Search for Sources will be conducted: Any offeror or group wishing to participate in the competition process MUST reply to this search for sources. Potential sources for this work must describe the teaching hospital environment in which the task will be conducted: the composition of Medical teams making rounds in the hospital, the frequency of such rounds, the wards in which rounds are made. Potential sources for this work must also describe the nature and extent of the wireless infrastructure in the hospital and the IT support available for the infrastructure. Potential sources for this work must also describe the qualifications of the medical practitioner who will be using the wireless PDA and the MD on Tap application. A Technical Evaluation Group (TEG) will evaluate the potential sources on their existing facilities, IT support, and expertise of the proposed medical practitioner. NIH personnel reserve the right to visit potential sites as part of the search for sources; however, a site visit is not required for a future award. 2. A Request for Quotes (RFQ) will be issued for the data generation and reporting task. Only sources identified as competitive through the search for sources will be solicited for quotes for the data generation and reporting task. The TEG will be convened to make the award for the data generation and reporting task. This award will be executed quickly through a Simplified Acquisitions Mechanism under FAR Part 13. 3. The work will be coordinated with research personnel at NLM who will monitor data generation and assure the task is progressing smoothly.

Task Description:
NLM proposes to contract for data generation and reporting specifically to address three questions: 1) What questions do clinicians raise at the point of care? 2) For what scenarios is MEDLINE useful for answering those questions? 3) How well does the MD on Tap application facilitate finding relevant, high-quality evidence from MEDLINE? Toward that end, this task will consist of providing one medical practitioner and appropriate IT support, to accompany a general/internal medicine Medical team on all teaching hospital and clinic rounds for eight weeks. This practitioner will have a strong background in clinical medicine with sufficient experience to understand the clinical scenarios presented, the questions raised and the quality of potential answers to the questions. This practitioner will not be the attending physician or an essential member of the Medical team.  During rounds whenever the Medical team fragments the practitioner will stay with the attending.  On these rounds, the practitioner will be equipped with a wireless PDA set up to access the wireless network at the hospital and with the MD on Tap application installed. The practitioner will note (on the PDA) all questions raised, including those for which the practitioner knows the answer, but not including questions concerning data in the patients’ records. The practitioner will also note the scenario for those questions, and, using the MD on Tap application, search for MEDLINE citations that address the question. Citations judged to be useful will be saved on the PDA. The MD on Tap intermediate server will recognize and store transactions from the practitioner’s PDA. 

Using a special desktop computer web-based program already developed at NLM, the practitioner can review the stored transactions at a later time to be reminded of the scenarios, questions and relevant citations. An example of the transaction review display is available at http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/mdot/EvalDocs/Attachment1-xactTrackExp1.doc. In combination with the notes taken during rounds, the practitioner may use the transaction review to assist in writing and submitting electronically a daily summary of the clinical activity, including a brief clinical scenario for each MEDLINE search session. As part of the summary, the practitioner will indicate one or more EBM clinical tasks (Diagnosis, Treatment, Etiology, Prognosis) for each question posed at the scenario and citations judged to be useful in answering the question. NLM software will associate the summary information with the MEDLINE search sessions.  NLM staff will check the summaries for consistency, corroborate the practitioner’s opinion regarding relevancy and quality of the selected citations and contact the practitioner by telephone or email to correct discrepancies or missing information.  An in-house program will analyze the MEDLINE search queries to group the search terms into one or more Semantic Groups (Disorders, Anatomy, Intervention, Drugs, Groups, Other). Thus for each scenario NLM will have on record one or more clinical question. For each question NLM will have on record the EBM task category and one or more MEDLINE searches. Associated with each search will be one or more semantic groups and one or more citations (if they exist) that the practitioner judged to be useful.

The practitioner will use the daily summaries for a final qualitative and quantitative assessment of the ability to find relevant evidence in MEDLINE. Over the course of the eight weeks, the practitioner will identify the features of MEDLINE searching (for example: limits, clinical queries), and the current features of MD on Tap (for example: history, EBM clusters) that are most useful for quickly finding useful citations, and any additional features that could facilitate that process. The practitioner’s opinions can be substantiated by the stored records of the features that were actually used. Additional in-house developed software will analyze the transactions and sessions for several measures including time and number of transactions needed to find relevant citations, semantic types of query terms most useful in finding relevant citations, and semantic types that appear frequently over the course of the study. 
 
NLM is specifically seeking a contractor that can provide the experienced medical practitioner, the teaching hospital environment and the wireless 802.11b/g compatible infrastructure.

Deliverables:
&#61607;	The successful contractor is expected to generate many real-time MD on Tap search sessions per day at the point-of-care and manually record the associated clinical scenarios and clinical questions. The search transactions will be recorded automatically by the MD on Tap system intermediate server. Summaries of the clinical scenarios and clinical questions will be submitted electronically by email each day using the format and extent of content shown as an example at http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/mdot/EvalDocs/Attachment2-DailySumExp.xls.

RFI Evaluation Criteria:
Responses to the Request for Information (RFI) that constitutes the search for sources will evaluate: 1. The stated qualifications of the proposed medical practitioner that will conduct the field work including the practitioner’s experience in the practice of Evidence based Medicine, and the ability of the proposed practitioner to devote the required amount of time to the data generation and reporting task independent of other duties while in the teaching hospital environment. 2. The described clinical care teaching environment; the size of the teaching hospital; the likely composition of the Medical teams with whom the practitioner will be making rounds.  Are there a sufficient number and variety of patients to assure that a large number of clinical questions will arise at the point-of-care over the proposed 8 weeks of fieldwork? Are the medical students and/or Residents encouraged to pose questions? How many patients is the proposed practitioner likely to see per day while on rounds?  On average, how many clinical questions are expected to arise per day at the point-of-care while the teams are making rounds? 3. The described existing 802.11b/g wireless infrastructure in the clinical care teaching environment, and the ownership of wireless PDAs with the Palm Operating System or the Pocket PC Operating System. In how many wards is wireless access to the Internet available at the point-of-care? How many wireless PDAs are currently being used in the proposed clinical care environment? How many technicians are available to support the 802.11b/g wireless infrastructure and the wireless PDAs? Because this contract is not intended to provide funds for new equipment acquisition, the responders should describe their current capabilities for wireless Internet access and support for both the infrastructure and the wireless PDAs. 

NLM reserves the right to include a site visit as part of the RFI evaluation.

<CONTACT>Kevin Kartchner, Staff-Lab Purchasing, Phone 5058459175, Fax 5058445266, Email khkartc@sandia.gov - Kevin Kartchner, Staff-Lab Purchasing, Phone 5058459175, Fax 5058445266, Email khkartc@sandia.gov
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia), a government-owned, contractor-operated facility located on Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has a requirement for both a 20" actuator system and an airgun system, both of which are to be used in mechanical-shock testing operations in Building 6570 within Sandia's Tech Area III.  Sandia has basic designs for both systems, having itself developed the design concept for the actuator system and having contracted with Seco-Dyn, Inc. of Ontario, California for the design concept for the airgun system.  It is Sandia's intention to issue a formal solicitation sometime around August 1, 2005, then to issue a contract sometime in September 2005, for (a) detailed designs (based on Sandia-provided specifications) for both the actuator system and the airgun system, and (b) options for fabrication and installation of the systems at Sandia.

(Current versions of the system specifications, in Microsoft Word format, can be obtained by e-mailing Kevin Kartchner, Sandia Contracting Representative, at khkartc@sandia.gov .)

After awarding the contract, Sandia will require the conceptual designs to be delivered no later than November 30, 2005, and the final detailed designs to be delivered no later than  November 2006.  However, due to matters related to the availability of funding, fabrication of the systems cannot commence prior to January 2008, whereas delivery, installation, and acceptance must occur no later than October 31, 2008.  Therefore, Sandia shall retain the right to exercise its options for fabrication and installation at Sandia through February 29, 2008.  Given the considerable passage of time between the anticipated date of contract award and the date by which Sandia must exercise options, Sandia will not require firm fixed-price quotations for fabrication and installation.  Rather, Sandia will require a comprehensive engineering estimate for both systems, which it will use as a baseline in negotiating a final price with the supplier at or about the time it exercises its options.

The purpose of this sources sought notice is to assist Sandia in preparing a list of qualified suppliers to whom to send the formal solicitation.  Interested suppliers, after having obtained and reviewed the specifications, should submit to Sandia a statement of qualifications (SOQ), consisting of no more than ten (10) pages, that describes the supplier's experience and capabilities in terms of designing, fabricating, and supplying similar systems.  Suppliers must submit their SOQs to Kevin Kartchner at khkartc@sandia.gov no later than July 22, 2005.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego, Det Seal Beach, is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of the Naval Facilities Expeditionary Logistics Center (NFELC), Port Hueneme, CA.  NFELC is seeking to identify potential sources and technical information for packaging concepts and techniques to enhance the way they currently inventory, pack, transport, use and store Naval Construction Force (NCF) Table of Allowance material.  This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind.  Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirement.  Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as the Government may use any information received.  The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-deve! lopmental item solutions or commercial items that can be easily modified to meeting existing Government requirements.  If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist,  the Government may entertain the procurement of developmental items based on the information received as a result of this market research.  The NCF is transforming its mobility packaging with initial efforts directed towards improved packaging of a Modular Core Air (MCA).  Representative items include spare parts, tools and tool kits, camp support equipment (tents, messing, hygiene, security) and field operational consumables.  Multiple modes of transportation are envisioned, as such, packaging should be compatible with 20-foot ISO containers, TRICON air transport 463L pallets. The packaging enhancements should address multiple aspects, which include but are not limited to the following: Packing efficiency – reduction of the total volume of packing materials such as pallet boxes or other protective packing.  The intent is to maximize the usable volume of the different type containers noted above and or reduce the time required to move material/repack from one transport mode to another. Inventory management – the ability to readily access and determine the contents (inventory) of packed items within the larger shipping configurations (ISO, TRICON, etc.)   Accessibility – the ability to rapidly access all items within the MCA.  The intent is to be able to access any of the packing boxes within a container without necessarily removing the entire contents of the container.   Integrity – the ability to retain all necessary items in a single location to maintain functional integrity to assemble or use the item (i.e., tent poles, pegs, skin, lights and heater in a single box) Security – the ability to maintain control of the contents of the packing boxes from pilfering/theft.  The ability to protect certain items/materials from environmental contamination such as rain or blowing sand. Durability – the ability to reuse the packing boxes for repacking upon mission completion and returning to stock.  The boxes should be able to withstand the normal handling of military cargo operations such as forklifts, cranes and roller conveyors in various cargo decks. Materials – non-wooden packing is desired due to environmental impact of both domestic and foreign insects, fungi. Collapsible – the ability to fold/disassemble boxes into a smaller volume for storage or return shipment is desired. In support of the assessment of feasibility, the following areas are of particular interest to NFELC:  materials of construction, weight limitations, internal and external dimensions (line drawings requested), weights and options. To facilitate vendor understanding of the Navy’s requirements, a single MCA will be unpacked and available for viewing at Naval Base Ventura County, Port Hueneme, from 19 to 21 July 2005. Site visits must be coordinated through Dan Divittorio, who can be reached by e-mail at Daniel.divittorio@navy.mil and by phone at 805-982-4759. Responses to this RFI shall include a brief description of the company, a statement of capabilities relevant to the requirement including brochures and any other documentation that will clearly demonstrate capabilities and characteristics of your packaging concepts and techniques, and examples of previous experience that demonstrates capability to execute the requirement.  Include a point contact with name, title, phone, fax and e-mail address.  In addition to the capabilities information, responding parties must also indicate their business size and ownership status, i.e., large, small, SDB, 8(a), SDVOSB, WOSB, VOSB, HBVCU/MI or HUB Zone.  Include the applicable CAGE and DUNS numbers.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations document (FAR) subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and following the simplified acquisition procedures in FAR part 13.5.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

Solicitation number HC1047-05-R-4035 is being issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-04.  The North American Classification is 541710 and the Size Standard is 107,812 employees.  The requirement is solicited on an open market basis for potential set-aside to a small business.  If two or more business firms submit responsive proposals the requirement will be set-aside to small businesses and award be made to that small business offering the lowest price.  Should fewer than two small businesses submit responsive proposals the requirement will be deemed unrestricted and award will be made based on the evaluation factors noted below.

The following FAR and DFAR clauses apply:

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items.
FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items
FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items

This procurement is estimated to be $132,000.00, including labor, travel, and materials.  The period of performance is one year.  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Joint Spectrum Center (JSC), is seeking sources that are capable of designing and evaluating protocols for wireless ad-hoc networks that enable efficient spectrum utilization while providing adequate Quality of Service (QoS) required for mission critical applications.

Recent advances reported in the technical literature outline a general framework for cross-layer optimization in wireless networks, which considers joint optimization of signal power levels, instantaneous data rates, routing, antenna weighting, link scheduling, and other parameters that can be used to increase wireless system capacity and reduce unintended interference..  Of particular interest is the development of advanced ad-hoc wireless protocols that intelligently manage the trade-offs between efficient spectrum utilization and QoS.  Sources must be familiar with such recent advances and be able to concretely demonstrate how a cross-layer optimization framework can be applied to the joint design of protocols for routing, scheduling, data rate, power control, and frequency spectrum allocation, within a framework of an accurate network model which captures network-wide interference.

The proposal should focus on the Spectrum-network Management convergence that enables efficient spectrum utilization while providing adequate QoS required for mission critical applications in light of the transformation to network-centric operations.  The proposal should address one or more (but is not limited to) the following areas: (1) interaction between routing, scheduling, and frequency assignment to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Department of Defense spectrum use, (2) capability to cope with network dynamics when unexpected external interference or node mobility causes changes in connectivity, and (3) method for determining of candidate routes, scheduling and frequency assignment algorithm.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   overall scientific or technical merits, innovativeness of approach/techniques, plan of execution and principle investigator, and realism of the proposed cost.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  Proposals are due by 10:00 AM EST on 25Jul05 and must be submitted by email to Franklin Wheeler, Jr. at franklin.wheelerf@jsc.mil.  Inquiries regarding the solicitation will only be accepted via email.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).   Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to:  Commandant (G-CPM-S/3) 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is for FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710-Chemical Research and Development Laboratories or Services  The solicitation number is PR-NC-05-10467, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-04.   A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. This procurement is for Development of a Standardized Approach for Evaluating Environmental Chemicals with Low Solubility (Highly Non-polar) in the Estrogen Receptor (ER) Competitive Binding Assay. STATEMENT OF WORK: Background and Purpose: The U.S. EPA is currently implementing an Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) that is designed to detect chemicals that alter the estrogen, androgen, and thyroid systems in human, fish and wildlife (http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/oscpendo/index.htm).  To date, the U.S. EPA has implemented the program on three fronts: (1) Establishing procedural rules and policy for program implementation; (2) Developing a strategy for how to prioritize chemicals for screening and testing; and (3) Developing protocols to conduct specific assays, evaluating their effectiveness, and ensuring that the assay can be performed reliably and consistently in different laboratories.  The project proposed under this contract will support the latter of these three activities by developing a standardized approach for evaluating environmental chemicals with low solubility in the estrogen receptor (ER) competitive binding assay. An ER competitive binding assay using rat uterine cytosol is currently undergoing evaluation for use in the Tier I Screening Battery of the Agency?s EDSP.  http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/oscpendo/assayvalidation/status.htm. To date, under the direction of the Office of Science Coordination and Policy (OSCP), an optimized protocol for this assay has been developed and pre-validation studies demonstrating its potential use for detecting environmental chemicals that can bind to the ER have been completed.  It is apparent from the previous studies that a standardized approach for evaluating environmental chemicals with low solubility should be included in the final protocol.   The incorporation of these methods is critical to ensure that the structurally diverse group of chemicals that will likely be tested using this protocol will be properly evaluated. Thus, the purpose of this contract is to  (1) Identify the limit concentrations for at least two chemical solvents (ethanol and DMSO) for the ER Competitive Binding Assay undergoing validation for the Agency?s EDSP;  (2) Develop a tiered approach for determining the best solvent and the limit of solubility any given test chemical;  (3) Compare ER binding affinity for a set of test chemicals using ethanol and DMSO as solvent;  and (4)  Demonstrate the utility of the standardized approach for a set of structurally diverse chemicals with low solubility and low binding affinity.   Data from these studies will be submitted to the OSCP for use while preparing the working protocol for the final validation studies for the ER Competitive Binding Assay.  Contractor Requirements:  Contractor Requirements-The contractor shall conduct the experiments using the protocol for ER Competitive Binding Assay (rat uterine cytosol) that is currently undergoing validation for the U.S. EPA?s EDSP.  The general protocol for this assay is available at:  http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/methods/endodocs/final/erbndbrd/erbndall.pdf (Appendix B5, 1-14), but a final protocol will be distributed at the time of contract award.  The Scope of Work shall be completed through multiple tasks, and written deliverables (electronic and hard copy) documenting the findings.  Completion and approval of each task shall be required before proceeding to the next task.   Problems or technical difficulties shall be reported immediately to the U.S. EPA technical point of contact.  Government Responsibilities: EPA shall provide the contractor with the test chemicals for Task IV only.  Chemicals (approximately 15) shall be distributed at least 1 month prior to the scheduled start of Task IV.  Upon receipt of the results from each task, EPA shall examine the data and provide feedback to the Contractor within 30 days.   Reporting Requirements:  The contractor shall file a report within 30 days after the completion of each task.  However, if the contractor has specific technical questions/issues,  unaudited reports/data may be submitted earlier to obtain feedback from EPA.  The report shall consist of a hard copy and an electronic version of the data, graphs, analyses, and conclusions.  Formats for electronic data shall be submitted in a lotus or excel spreadsheet suitable for further data analyses.  Graphs shall be submitted as PRISM, Lotus Freelance, Powerpoint, and pdf files.   The time frame for each task is as follows: Tasks I and II (2  months);  Task III (2 months); and Task IV (6 months).   Quality Assurance (QA): Quality Assurance Documentation shall be submitted to the U.S. EPA Project Officer within 60 days after the effective date of the contract.  A hybrid version of the Quality Management Plan and the Quality Assurance Plan (see EPA website) may be submitted to meet this requirement. No work involving direct measurements or data generation, compilation of data from literature or electronic media shall be initiated under this project until the EPA Project Officer has approved the quality assurance documentation.  Additional QA guidance documents can be found on the internet at http://es.epa.gov/ncer/guidance/qa.html.   Delivery Schedule: Tasks I and II (within 2 months after the effective date of the order), Task III (within 2 months after the completion and acceptance of Task 1), and Task IV (within 6 months after the completion and acceptance of Task III). All final reports and data shall be due with the completion of Task IV.   Equipment: The contractor shall provide all necessary equipment for the project. EPA shall provide the selected chemicals for Task IV in accordance with "Government Responsibilities" found in previous section.  Security:  Although the research to be conducted under this award is not considered to be of a sensitive nature, it is expected that data safeguards shall be incorporated under the study design.   Place of Performance:  The submitted proposal shall indicate where the studies are to be conducted, and the U.S. EPA reserves the right to conduct periodic site visits and QA audits at the research organization.   Period of Performance:  The period of performance shall be 10 months from the effective date of the award. Task I:  Identify the limit concentration for at least two chemical solvents (ethanol and DMSO) for the ER Competitive Binding Assay.  It is known that high concentrations of solvents such as ethanol can coagulate protein and destroy the ability of a receptor to bind and retain ligand.  Thus, the maximum concentration of each solvent that can be used under any specific set of assay conditions should be identified in order to prevent interference (e.g., reduction) with maximal ER binding.   Using the same protocol currently undergoing evaluation by the U.S. EPA?s EDSP, carefully demonstrate the limit concentration for each solvent (e.g, using increasing concentrations of ethanol or DMSO, determine the maximal concentration of solvent for which no inhibition of ER binding is detected).  (Note: The general protocol for this assay is available at: http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/methods/endodocs/final/erbndbrd/erbndall.pdf   (Appendix B5, 1-14), but a final protocol will be distributed at the time of contract award.).   Full ER competitive binding curves shall be conducted in two runs for each solvent (with two replicates for each solvent concentration ranging from 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 5, 10, and 15% solvent per total volume in each assay tube).  The report shall include all raw data, graphs of competitive binding curves, the limit concentration for each solvent. In addition, electronic copies of all data and graphs should be submitted.  Data shall be submitted to the U.S. EPA technical point of contact.   Task II: Develop a tiered approach for determining the best solvent and the limit of solubility for any test chemical.  It shall be noted that the chemicals that will be tested using the ER competitive binding assay will encompass a broad group of structurally diverse chemicals. The solubility characteristics of a particular test chemical, ranging from polar to highly non-polar, will limit the maximal concentration of the chemical that can be tested in the assay.  The objective of this task shall be to develop a tiered approach for (1) determining the best solvent (Note: Order of solvents tested should be water, ethanol, and then DMSO as specified by ICCVAM?s Expert Panel Report (Section 2.1.3) http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/methods/endodocs/edfinrpt/edfinrpt.pdf ) for any given test chemical, and (2) identifying the maximum concentration of the test chemical that can be used in the assay without disrupting ER binding kinetics.   An example of a tiered approach developed for the NTP, NICEATM, ICCVAM, NIEHS?s  In Vitro Cytotoxicity Validation Study may be found at the following web site:  http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/methods/invidocs/phIIIprot/solphIII.pdf.  However, it is anticipated that the approach for the ER Competitive Binding Assay will also include preliminary information of the physical properties of the test chemical (e.g., partition coefficients, hydrophobicity, solubility, etc.), as well as indicators that a chemical is precipitating out after being added to the assay tube/buffer (e.g., U-shaped curves with increasing chemical concentration; solubility test using light scattering technique and Nepheloskan instrument).  The report for this task shall include a flow chart demonstrating the approach for (1) determining the best solvent as evidenced by allowing the highest limit concentration of the test chemical (but not to exceed 1mM); and (2) determining the maximum concentration of test chemical that can be used in the assay without chemical precipitation following addition to the assay tube and an overnight incubation at 4 C.   Task III: Compare ER binding affinity for a set of test chemicals in ethanol and DMSO.  The objective of this task shall be to determine whether or not the IC50 for a test chemical is likely to change significantly when different solvents are used.  ER competitive binding curves and IC50s shall be compared for a set of 5 ? 8 test chemicals when ethanol and DMSO are used as the solvent (Note: EPA shall select the chemicals to be used in this task).  The chemicals selected for this task shall have known ER binding affinities (ranging from high to low). Duplicate curves (2 runs) shall be conducted for each test chemical with each solvent; test chemical concentrations will range from .1nM ? 1 mM (in duplicates).   The report shall include all raw data, graphs of competitive binding curves, and the comparison of IC50s. In addition, electronic copies of all data and graphs shall be submitted. Task IV: Demonstrate the utility of the standardized approach (developed in Task II) using a set of structurally diverse chemicals.  This task shall include a set of 15 chemicals that will be distributed by the U.S. EPA to the contractor.  Competitive binding assays with full concentration curves shall be conducted in two runs with duplicates at each concentration for each chemical using the best solvent.  For this task, some of the chemicals will have limited solubility in ethanol (e.g., limit concentration will range from 1 -10 uM), but inhibit binding 10 - 40% at the limit dose (determined from previous testing).   For these chemicals, DMSO shall be tested to determine if a higher limit concentration can be obtained. If so, then a Ki experiment will be conducted for those chemicals at the limit dose using the alternate solvent.  General methods for the Ki experiments are reported in Laws et al., 1996. (Toxicology. 112(3):173-82), but a final protocol shall be distributed by the U.S. EPA at the time of contract award.  The report shall include all raw data, graphs of competitive binding curves, Ki experiments, and the comparison of IC50s. In addition, electronic copies of all data and graphs shall be submitted. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:  Chemicals for task III shall be purchased by the contractor at an estimated cost of $100 or less per chemical.   Proposal Instructions and Evaluation Criteria: The Government intends to award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable proposal offers the ?Best Value? to the Government.  ?Best Value? will be determined based on (1) technical capability, (2) past performance and (3) price.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations. 

The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) is within the DRM Division and was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response mechanism.

Q2:  Can you provide a stronger detail on the coverage requirements.  Industry wide there is not one carrier offering ubiquitous coverage CONUS wide.  Most cover the top 200 MSAs or more.  How detailed would the proposal coverage requirements need to be?  A map?  Coverage by locations etc?  Can you be more specific?

A2:  The primary coverage is at Patuxent River, MD and the surrounding area, other NAVAIR sites such as Lakehurst, NJ, Orlando, FL, Cherry Point, NC, and China Lake, CA, and other large metropolitan areas in CONUS.  The synopsis/solicitation indicates local and nationwide service plans.  The synopsis/solicitation also delineates the specific requirements.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to include a map of the current coverage that they provide.  The synopsis/solicitation specifies the government’s requirement in detail and the response to the government requirement is the responsibility of the contractor.

Q3:  Will the award be sole source or will the award be issued to more than one vendor?

A3:  The acquisition was published as a full and open competition in accordance with the synopsis/solicitation.  The government, however, is anticipating a single award to one recipient.

Q4:  Can you say which provider you are currently using?

The incumbent is:

Arch Wireless
1800 W. Park Dr., Suite 250
Westborough, MA 01581-3989

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR CNC, 5-AXIS, BED-TYPE MILLING MACHINE.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions that were asked before the due date. Question  1.It states on line item marked 6 that spindle motor shall operate on 480 VAC, 60Hz 3 phase Power. Is it acceptable that the seller provide a transformer that has primary power of 480 VAC, 60 Hz 3 phase and a secondary power of 200/220 VAC 60 Hz 3 phase motor. This is very standard for the machine tool industry.  Answer  1.The intent of this requirement is that the user will only provide 480V power to the machine.  It may be transformed as necessary at the machine by the seller. Question 2.In line item 13 it states a CNC screen size of 11 inches is required. Standard CNC screen size is 10.4 “. How is the 11 inch size requirement measured? Is 10.4 inch screen size acceptable? Answer  2. A screen size of 10.4" is acceptable. Question  3. In line item 17 it states the machine is to be installed in a minimum of 5 days.  This is a large machine and requires much leveling, alignment and laser calibration for this reason can the installation number of day’s requirement be extended to 14 to 21 days? Answer  3.The requirement states a minimum of 5 days will be included.	The seller may extend the period as required but may not offer less than 5 days. Question  4. In line item 21 it states the machine is to be delivered to Marshal Space center ARO 60 days. Is there any flexibility on this time period? Judging from the specification this machine will probably have to built by any machine builder so delivery could be any where from 6 to 8 months. Answer  4.  The requirement stands. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on July 8, 2005. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
