<SUBJECT>R -- Poverty Reduction by Increasing the Competitiveness of Enterprises
<SOLNBR>388-06-001
<CONTACT>Joseph McGee, Regional contracting Officer, Phone (880) (2) 885-5500 ext 2583, Fax (880) (2) 882--3648, Email jmcgee@usaid.gov - Shafique Nazim, Acquisition & Assistance Specialist, Phone 880-2-885-5500, ext. 2335, Fax 880-2-881-5050, Email snazim@usaid.gov
<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Office of Acquisition and Assistance in Dhaka, Bangladesh, intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals from qualified organizations interested in implementing the Poverty Reduction by Increasing the Competitiveness of Enterprises (PRICE) component, also referred to as a sub-activity, of USAID’s Economic Development and Growth with Equity (EDGE) activity.

USAID/Bangladesh acknowledges that a vibrant private sector is essential to economic growth and poverty reduction. Furthermore, USAID contends that in order to address Bangladesh’s daunting level of poverty, economic growth must be tempered with a focus on equity. 

The PRICE sub-activity will be the principal mechanism by which USAID provides technical assistance to the private sector. The PRICE implementer will work in collaboration with various non-governmental organizations, and relevant Government of Bangladesh (GOB) ministries, including the Ministry of Commerce. The PRICE implementer will work with a range of enterprises within a minimum of six sub-sectors with the intention of increasing access to new, profitable markets, leveraging finance, improving workforce skills, expanding the presence of embedded business development services, encouraging applied research and increasing the use of information and communications technology (ICT) as a productivity-enhancing tool.  

PRICE is one sub-activity of the USAID/Bangladesh’s broader Economic Development and Growth with Equity (EDGE) activity.  To achieve broad-based economic growth requires effective engagement of the public and private sectors. Consequently, the EDGE activity consists of two, complementary implementation subactivities:

1.	Poverty Reduction by Increasing the Competitiveness of Enterprises (PRICE), 
2. 	Policy Analysis, Monitoring and Assessment (PAMA).

As previously stated, PRICE is designed to ensure interventions support pro-poor economic growth. The PAMA sub-activity involves strengthening the development and reform of pro-poor and pro-business policies and regulations in Bangladesh. The PAMA and PRICE implementers will be expected to work in concert to ensure interventions are effective and measures to promote equity are adopted within each assisted sub-sector.  Potential offerors are invited to go to www.usaid.gov/bd/proposal_resources.html (Proposal Information webpage) for an extended narrative on the EDGE activity, its components and relevant background reports and studies.

The PRICE contract’s period of performance is expected to be five years with a total estimated ranging between $24,000,000 and $26,000,000.  USAID encourages the participation of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns as the prime contractor or as subcontractors in the implementation of this proposed award.  

Organizations expressing interest in this contract competition should do so online by clicking on “Register as Interested Vendor” and filing in the Registration Form. Accordingly, there will not be a separate attachment to the RFP of a list of interested parties. 

The RFP is expected to be issued before the end of February 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Service Administration. Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued and posted on the website along with the RFP. Offerors are encouraged to check the FedBizOps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) periodically.
