<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  FAR 13 applies.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation M67854-05-R-5169 is a Request for Proposal (RFP) and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03 and Defense Acquisition Circular 91-13.  NAICS Code is 336112.  This is not a small business set aside.  DPAS Rating is: DO.  The purpose of this electrical lift actuator or “actuator” is to lift a rocket rail to the appropriate launching angle for M58 munitions deployment.  The actuator will be powered by ABV power, which is supplied by a 28 VDC generator and 24 VDC batteries meeting the requirements of MIL-STD-1275B.  The actuator will be connected to that system by a power!  line which may introduce up to 4.6 volts drop. The actuator shall be capable of providing 4400 lb peak force during acceleration, followed by a 3200 lb sustained force. The running velocity of the actuator shall be approximately 0.35 inch per second or greater (permitting a 10-inch lift to firing position within 30 seconds) with 19.4 volts applied to its terminals. Proportionately slower operating speed with lower voltages is acceptable, provided the actuator does not stall at an applied voltage of 13.4 volts (MIL-STD-1275B low battery condition less 4.6 volts line loss). Maximum current draw shall not exceed 40 amperes during the initial acceleration period. Maximum current draw during the sustained thrust period shall not exceed 35 amperes. Minimum extension shall be 26.5 inches, and the stroke shall be a minimum of 13.8 inches. The actuator shall not require a brake, but shall be capable of retaining its extension with power removed, while supporting a 3200 lb static loa! d plus a vibration load as specified by MIL-STD-810F (tracked vehicles). The bottom of the actuator shall have a tab and pin mechanical interface that mates to a CLEVIS, Drawing 82A5052A0108.  The top of the actuator shall have a tab and pin mechanical interface that mates to a LINEAR ACTUATOR ATTACHMENT ASSEMBLY, Drawing 10810007.  Drawings package can be requested from Ms. Hake at 703.432.3693 or requested via e-mail from peggy.hake@usmc.mil.  Maximum width measured parallel to the clevis pin shall not exceed 8.5 inches. Maximum depth measured perpendicular to the clevis pin shall not exceed 8.1 inches. The actuator shall be capable of operation in an ambient temperature of -25oF to +125oF (threshold), +150oF (objective). The actuator shall contain two limit switches that open upon minimum and maximum extension. The electrical interface shall consist of a terminal strip in a sealed junction box, and shall consist of motor power, limit switches (one common lead acceptable),!  and (if required to meet the temperature requirements) heater power not to exceed 0.5 ampere.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.  FAR Clauses:  52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulatio! n (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in OR! CA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions caref! ully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirm! ative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-1 Buy American Act-Supplies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.o.B.

Elimination of continuous modifications to the RF absorber in the anechoic chamber will help ensure its RF performance, resulting reduced cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

Revised price offers or quotes shall be electronically submitted by Offerors or Quoters during the DPE.

Time Period. The DPE will be conducted for a period of    30 minutes or . If an offer or quote is submitted within the last  5  minutes of the time period, the DPE period shall be extended for an additional     5   minutes, if the offer/quote is the lowest price received. The time shall be extended for an unlimited number of     5 minute extension periods, if a lower offer/quote is submitted within the last    5 minutes.

Any offeror having problems during a DPE must notify the Contracting Office at FISC San Diego immediately. A “problem” is an event that interferes with the Offeror’s ability to participate in the DPE and includes, but is not limited to, Internet connection and re-connection difficulties, (2) software or hardware failures, and (3) erroneous data entry errors. Offerors will have    5  minutes after the DPE goes into the “Quiet Period” status to notify the Contracting Office of any problems.

D.	AFTER THE DPE  1.	Closing Price Discussions. Discussions concerning price shall normally conclude at the close of the DPE. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2.	No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the close of the Dynamic Pricing Event may not automatically be awarded the contract or purchase order that results from this solicitation. 3.	Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be sent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system.

<DESC>This synopsis serves as a Request for Information (RFI) prior to release of any resultant solicitation.  The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to procure a proposed dental and/or vision benefits program commercial acquisition solicited under full and open competition procedures.  The base period is expected to be awarded for seven years, with each option period consisting of seven years. There will be no limit to the number of options the Government may exercise.  OPM will issue a solicitation that will establish fixed price contracts with prospective price re-determination for dental and/or vision benefits to be provided based on the Federal Employee Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004.  The Government may award multiple contracts.  The NAICS code is 524114/6M (Direct Health and Medical Insurance Carriers).  Place of performance may vary.  Interested parties may submit offers either as a single entity or as a consortium.  The information contained in this RFI is based on the best and most current information available to date, is subject to change, and is not binding on the government.  Interested parties are encouraged to review the Statement of Work (SOW) and provide comments.  The SOW is expected to be posted on or around August 25, 2005 at the OPM website http://www.opm.gov/carrier/dentalvision/dvbidders.asp. OPM invites comments from interested parties on topics you think OPM should consider to ensure a healthy competition among offerors and provide prospective offerors with the necessary information to effectively develop a response to the solicitation.  OPM must receive comments by 3:00PM September 6, 2005.  OPM will consider the comments and questions when finalizing the solicitation.  However, OPM will not disclose any questions or comments that are submitted.  OPM is requesting comments on the proposed timeline for implementing the dental and vision program.  While the timeline will be included in the draft SOW, potential vendors are encouraged to comment on the timeline immediately  but no later than 3:00PM September 6, 2005 at the following email address dental-visionbids@opm.gov.  OPM’s current timeline for procurement actions leads up to a July 2006 start date.  OPM is soliciting input on the preferences of interested vendors for a later date in 2006 that would be more compatible with other Federal employee benefit programs that operate on a calendar year cycle.  Concerns about a mid-year start date include potential increased underwriting risk and/or low enrollment for the initial six month enrollment period.  While OPM is prepared to address these concerns, if industry reaction indicates a mid-year startup is not optimal, we will consider a startup date based  on the beginning of the last pay period in 2005 and revise the proposed timeline and SOW accordingly.  If this course of action is followed, both will be reissued for comment a later date.  TENTATIVE TIMELINE:
August 25, 2005 SOW posted on OPM’s website for public comment;  September 6, 2005 vendor comment due to OPM; September 16, 2005 solicitation issued; September 30, 2005 interested parties conference; November 16, 2005 vendor bids due; January 16, 2006 OPM review bids, negotiates and final proposal revised; February 28, 2006 contract award(s) and contract negotiation(s); April/May 2006 Open Season enrollment; July 1, 2006 contract award.  Under this timeline the solicitation is expected to be issued on or around September 16, 2005 with proposals due on or about November 16, 2005.  An opportunity for questions will be offered.  The award decision will be based on a BEST VALUE determination. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, will be approximately equal in importance to cost or price.  At a minimum, proposals shall include (1) a detailed statement of the benefits offered, including any maximums, limitations, exclusions, and other definitions of benefits; (2) premiums proposed and underlying assumptions; (3) demonstration of proven experience in providing dental and/or vision benefits to public and private sector organizations; and (4) demonstration of the financial resources necessary to bear the insurance risk.  Proposals will be evaluated using weighted factors as described in the solicitation.  The solicitation will be available exclusively for download electronically approximately 30 calendar days after the date of this synopsis posting through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website http://www.fbo.gov/

<DESC>The DHHS/PSC/SAS Division of Acquisition Management plans to issue a request for proposal (RFP) entitled Workplace Based Behavioral Health Services for Federal Occupational Health Services (FOH).   FOH is a component of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and the Program Support Center (PSC) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  FOH has provided occupational health programs for Federal employees for nearly 60 years.  FOH operates under the principles of Public Laws 99-750 and 79-650 (5 U.S.C., Section 7901).  These laws established Federal agency responsibility for developing and maintaining prevention, intervention and rehabilitation programs and services for Federal employees who have alcohol and/or other problems.  To fulfill this mission, FOH designs various occupational health services including workplace based behavioral health services to promote and maintain the physical and mental health of Federal employees.  FOH enters into agreements with customer organizations to provide these services for them and either directly delivers the services or contracts with qualified vendors capable of providing direct services.  When services are contracted, FOH provides technical oversight to ensure delivery of professionally sound, cost-effective services.  The purpose of these proposed contracts is to obtain services of a contractor to provide Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Services including EAP Optional Services, to employees and organizations located throughout the United States including the Pacific Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands wherever customer organizations employees are located.   The EAP provided by FOH is a comprehensive service designed to empower employees in their efforts to resolve personal problems that may impact adversely on work performance.  The goal of the EAP is to address such problems in the quickest, least restrictive, most convenient, and least costly manner while strictly respecting clients confidentiality.  EAP Optional Services are designed to be delivered on a stand-alone basis to complement other services received by customer organizations to help fill gaps in services, and to provide a more complete solution to meeting customer organizations occupational behavioral health needs.  These services may involve any service that requires special emphasis to meet customer organizations needs.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the National Association for Children of  Alcoholics (NACOA) , Rockville, MD.
Purpose:

According to research from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, approximately one in four children in the United States is exposed to alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence in the family.  Many other children are living in families where there is illicit drug abuse.  Further evidence suggests that genetics and social/environmental factors can predispose children of substance abusing parents to the onset of behavioral problems or to become abusers of alcohol or illegal drugs themselves.  These children are also at higher than average risk for problems in school and social relationships; factors that can result in greater stress for families in which parents are in treatment for substance abuse. Early identification of these at-risk children and brief interventions through appropriate support systems may greatly reduce their likelihood of substance abuse related problems and increase their resiliency.  

Capacity building and outreach to the various sectors of the community who might provide such brief interventions are an important component of SAMHSA’s Strategic Prevention Framework.  SAMHSA/CSAP has identified three sectors of the community whose capacity towards addressing these problems is crucial and will be greatly enhanced by the development of tools and resources that will assist them with such brief interventions.  They are social workers, members of the clergy and youth educators/school counselors.  SAMHSA/CSAP has identified NACoA and their work with professionals in these sectors as a vehicle for creating appropriate tools and resources for these professional groups.

NACoA’s affiliation with multi-disciplinary service providers who reach children of alcoholics offers SAMHSA/CSAP a unique opportunity to access specific target audiences related to issues on the SAMHSA Matrix and tailor appropriate educational messages and products to meet their needs.  By strengthening the abilities of the professionals who deal with substance abuse issues, SAMHSA/CSAP can strengthen the capacity of communities to achieve positive outcomes for substance abuse and related problems and thereby achieve the goals of the Strategic Prevention Framework.

The National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACoA) is a non-profit membership organization working on behalf of children of alcoholics.  NACoA is a national center for information, education and advocacy for children of alcoholics and a policy development center.   NACoA is also a central point of input for those who address children of alcoholic populations including pediatricians, social workers, clergy, child advocates, and other service providers.

For 22 years NACoA has been the only organization serving children of alcoholics in the U.S.  This is a primary at-risk audience for substance abuse, mental illness and HIV/AIDS prevention.  There is no better way to reach this specific audience and the professionals who work to improve outcomes for this special population.

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service in Parlier, Ca. has a requirment for a Cryotransfer System for a Hitachi S3500-N Scanning Electron Microscope.  The system should have a large enough Dewar to privent the operator from constantly having to refill the Dewar.  The metal coating device should be the "gol" type and should be able to last for a large number of speciment coatings.  Gold depositing should be controlled by the operator to allow for optimal specimen coating.  The cryofixation by plunge freezing in mitrogen slush, the cryofracturing, and the gold sputter coating should all take place under a vacuum, in a cryohamber which can be mounted on the side of the microscope.  This will help prevent the specimen from being exposed to the atmosphere after it has been frozen.  The system should have a binocular view to alow the operator to align the fracture blade with the specimen and afterward be able to see if the cryfracture occured in the desired plane or if another fracture must be made.  This feature is very important if the number of specimens is limited.  
An RFQ can be obtained by mail or fax to the attention of Saul Garcia as listed in this notice.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics intend to procure on a sole-source basis with the University of Ghana Medical School, PO Box 4236, Accra, Ghana for the continuation of a study on the estimation of burden of prostate diseases in Accra, Ghana. The goal of this study is to characterize the burden of prostate cancer in Accra, Ghana, for comparison with other population groups.  The specific goals of this study are to 1) estimate the incidence of clinical prostate cancer in Accra, Ghana; 2) characterize the clinical and pathological characteristics of prostate cancer cases in Accra, Ghana; 3) screen patients presenting at the Korle-Bu Hospital Urology Clinic in Accra with symptoms for prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), using PSA tests, DRE, and biopsy as needed; 4) abstract medical charts for at least 200 biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer cases and 200 BPH cases identified at the Urology Clinic; 5) screen over 1,000 randomly selected men (with the goal of getting consent from 1,000 men) aged 50-74 from the Accra population for prostate cancer and BPH using PSA tests, digital rectal exams, and biopsy confirmation as needed; 6) compare prostate cancer risk in Accra to that of African-Americans in SEER, both before and after 1986, when prostate cancer screening entered widespread use in the U.S. The University of Ghana Medical School is the only known source to the NCI researcher that has the expertise and network in the local community of Accra, Ghana to do this.  Ghana was selected as the site for the screening cohort because it is an English Speaking Country in west Africa with adequate infrastructure to ensure the high-quality of the study.  This includes the availability of a census listing for the random selection of subjects from the population and adequate medical facility for screening and for processing of study samples. This contract is to provide support for continuation of an ongoing study initiated under basic ordering agreement (#233-02-0090 Task Order #3).  Changes in the population would be detrimental to the quality of the study. There is no other contractor that has the access to this population and the expertise to carry out the study in Accra, Ghana.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 16, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541990; Size Standard is 6 million.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>MOD: The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue a delivery order against BOA N00019-03-G-0003 on an other than full and open competition to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) 6900 Main Street, P.O. Box 9731, Stratford, CT 06615-9129.  Sikorsky is the H-53 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and possesses the necessary technical data on the H-53 main rotor blade design.  SAC will be required to evaluate both a mature erosion-resistant polymer as well as a mature nano-composite-based material that reduce the destructive effects of wind, rain, sand and other environmental conditions on H-53 main rotor blades. Both the polymer and nano-composite materials were previously developed and proven through a Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (DASN) (RDT&E) funded Rapid Technology Transition (RTT) project to have potential for application on H-53 main rotor blades.  As part of the evaluation process, one of these materials will be selected based on a comparative analysis of severe laboratory qualification testing, main rotor blade coating application techniques, main rotor blade coating repair procedure, main rotor blade performance analyses and level of improvement over existing main rotor blade protection. The selected material will then be applied to existing H-53 main rotor blades for ground testing at the contractor’s facility followed by Government conducted operational flight testing on an H-53 aircraft. This synopsis is for informational purposes only.   See numbered note 22.

<DESC>This is a Solicitation Notice for the General Services Administration.  GSA will
will be issuing a RFP solicitation for Design-Build Services for a project located at the 230 N. First Avenue, Phoenix, AZ, Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Design Intent Bridging Documents have been completed and will be used to solicit bids from qualified Design-Build contractor. These documents will serve as the approved Design Intent, to be used by the awarded contractor to complete Construction Documents.

This project will involve the North and South elevations of the building, where the current fresh air intakes are located. The mechanical rooms, located at the North and South elevations, currently use fresh air intake fed through on-grade and above-grade openings from the basement to the 8th floor.  The Design Intent Bridging Documents require the construction of a new intake air shaft from the street level to the 8th floor that will limit fresh air intake to the areas at the 5th floor and above. The shaft will be sealed at the floors below the 5th floor.

The estimated timeframe on this project is ten months for both design and construction.  All work will need to be closely coordinated with GSA to ensure undisturbed and normal operations of the building and its tenants during the construction period.  Any disruptive work may have to be scheduled for after hours.  The normal building hours are Monday through Friday 6AM – 6PM.  The total estimated budget on this project is $500,000 - $1,000,000.  All employees working on this project will need to pass a full background check through the Department of Homeland Security.  Only those who have passed the security check will be allowed to work on the project.

<DESC>The synopsis appearing on or about 17 June 2005 is hereby modified to ADD the following:  This requirement is full and open competition.  The NAIC code is changed to “493190” “OTHER WAREHOUSING AND STORAGE”.  Additionally, the services to be provided is for Navy DEPMEDS that are either designed and packed to be deployed in configurations or platforms, which meet the individual requirements of each mission, or designed, packed, and pre-positioned for deployment as a specific configuration in anticipation of future missions.  In each case, items comprising DEPMEDS are categorized and packed into groups or assemblages designed to provide a specific functional capability (i.e. pharmacy, laboratory, surgery, radiology, intensive care wards, dental, power generation, power distribution, potable water, wastewater collection and storage, laundry, staff housing, galley, public works, etc.).  These functional area assemblages are called authorized medical allowance lists (AMAL) or authorized dental allowance lists (ADAL) and are the building blocks used by FHSO staff to create DEPMEDS configurations in the Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) computer network system.   These configurations typically range from 10 to 500-bed systems but can be as small as an individual AMAL /ADAL assemblage or greater than, the 500-bed system, depending on the mission (up to 2500 different configuration).  The basic concept is worldwide “just-in-time” delivery for any potential need or mission.  The solicitation will be issued on or before 11 Jul 2005.

 (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.

3. Our subcontractor for this proposal has received extensive support from several other sources that support these same activities.   How should we show these additional funds as a part of our business proposal?”
  
Answer: Subcontractor should only show what it will charge to do the work in the budget.  The support sources funding should not be shown.

4) Will it be permissible to propose the work of subcontractors on a product basis rather than time and effort?
     Answer: Product or deliverable basis is fine, but cost must be shown in the budget.

The AFRL Sensors Directorate at Rome Research Site is soliciting proposals for various studies, capabilities and experiments which bring together enabling technology base and system concepts at a combined state-of-the-art level greater than currently available.  The desired overall result is to identify technologies and credible enabling system concepts considering non-traditional RF technologies that can be more fully explored in the early stages of potential new programs.  Resultant concepts and technology roadmaps may be presented to AFRL for possible inclusion in future programs.  This is a four (4) year Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) to solicit Research and Development (R & D) proposals for advanced RF networking techniques.  The following areas have been identified as important for developing high-capacity networking systems while integrating new and advanced technology:  Development of research and interaction between Government and industry to bring together both technology base and system concepts for advanced sensing and communication systems.  

Principal funding of this PRDA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY03.  Individual awards will normally range from 6 to 24 months in duration with amounts normally ranging up to $500K per year.  Total funding for this PRDA is approximately $4M.  

Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  

This PRDA is open and effective until 30 September 2007.   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  Offerors are required to submit (3) copies of a two (2) to five (5) page proposal.  All proposals submitted in response to this PRDA must be addressed to:  AFRL/SNRT, ATTN:  James Perretta, Reference PRDA 03-14-IFKA, AFRL/SNRT, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514.

Proposals will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available after the specified date.  Additional areas of interest and the dates for submission of proposals will be posted from time to time as requirements are identified.  All responsible firms may submit proposals which shall be considered.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, an e-mail address, and a fax number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 03-14-IFKA.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  

Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (a)  The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal; (b)  The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, and (c)  The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees.  Also, consideration of other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA will be used.  No other evaluation criteria will be used in selecting proposals.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.

An informational briefing/industry day is not planned.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."

Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  This PRDA is open and effective until 30 September 2007.

<CONTACT>Shirley Marion Contract Specialist 7022938034     smarion@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a contract to Colorado State University (CSU), Fort Collins, Colorado.  This is follow-on work for Phase II of an ongoing study currently being performed by CSU.  The Government has made the determination that it would be in their best interest to sole source this effort to CSU due to the proprietary nature of the software being utilized. The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City, NV, has a requirement for the following: Task 1.  Conduct stochastic analysis, modeling and simulation of the Colorado River stream flows to provide likely scenarios of stream flow patterns that may occur during future planning horizons. Annual, seasonal, and monthly temporal scales across the Upper and the Lower Colorado basin will be examined. Improved modeling capabilities such as models for intermittent streams, seasonal models of shifting means, alternative models for temporal disaggregation, and non-parametric modeling procedures may be developed. Task 2.  Enhance the Stochastic Analysis, Modeling, and Simulation (SAMS) software package to include various other options and modeling alternatives and to improve the input and output interface and graphical display of results.  Task 3.  Characterize the severity, recurrence and risk of low flows and droughts for the entire Colorado River system.  This will include analysis based on historical naturalized flows, reconstructed flows based on tree ring indices, stochastic generated flows, and analytical approximations.  Drought characterization will be made based on annual and seasonal stream flows at single and multiple sites. Task 4.  On site training of the main products (models plus software) developed in the project. The anticipated award date is on or about August 15, 2005.  For questions, please contact Shirley Marion at (702) 293-8034 or email smarion@lc.usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990, the size standard is $6.0 M.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division has a requirement to provide P-3C Avionics Improvement Program (AIP) Forward Deployed Trainers (FDT) to provide the capability of integrated forward deployed mission rehearsal training for the P-3C Avionics Improvement Program (AIP) Tactical Coordinators (TACCO) and the non-acoustic (SS-3) and acoustic (SS-1/2) sensor operators predominantly in Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW) and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) environments.  This capability does not now exist and has been determined to be an immediate and critical requirement.  In order to provide high fidelity simulation, maintain commonality of design across P-3C training devices and reduce overall program risk, the new devices will re-use the software and hardware designs being developed for the 2F179A Tactical Operational Readiness Trainer (TORT) Host computer, IOS, TACCO, SS-3 and SS-1/2 stations, including a scaled-down acoustic stimulation system to minimize the delivery time and have a trainer fielded to meet the critical training requirement.  This approach creates a significant and quantifiable risk associated with the required delivery schedule for other than the 2F179A(TORT) contractor, since the required hardware and software designs will not be delivered to the Government until late 2006 or early 2007.  The required delivery of the first P-3 AIP FDT is August 2007 with up to seven additional trainers with two-month incremental deliveries.  These devices will be located at the following CONUS and OCONUS sites:  Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville, FL; NAS Whidbey Island, WA; Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) Kaneohe, HI; NAS Brunswick, ME; Sigonella, Sicily; Misawa, Japan; Kadena, Okinawa and a yet to be determined OCONUS site.  The estimated contract value is $11.1M for 7 trainers, associated technical data, logistics support and spares.  The 8th trainer would be located at NAS Brunswick and additional funding would have to be obtained for it.   Without the availability of 2F179A TORT documentation provided as Government Furnished Information (GFI), no contractor other than the 2F179A TORT prime contractor will have the critical design data to manufacture and deliver the P-3 AIP FDT within the required delivery schedule.  It is the Government’s intent to award on a sole source basis to the 2F179A TORT prime manufacturer which is L-3 Communications Corp., Link Simulation and Training Division, 2200 Arlington Downs Road, Arlington, TX 76011.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  See CBD numbered note 22 (45 days is changed to read 15 days).

<DESC>A10 Control Display Unit (CDU) Backplane Assembly (Mother board), request for information.  This announcement constitutes a request for information.  The Air Force plans to use Form, Fit and Function (F3I) to replace the existing backplane assembly that resides in the CDU with a more reliable, longer life backplane assembly that has a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of at least 1,000 hours.
The F3I procedure encourages the procurement of items using performance based acquisition specifications versus build -to- print requirements.  This procurement will be based on “Best Value” to the government, not necessarily requirements.  The backplane assembly will incorporate state of the art technology and will be compatible with existing hardware and software interfaces in order to maintain form, fit, function, and interface equivalence.  The information in this request is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting a market survey of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah.  This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. We are seeking contractors interested in designing and manufacturing a high reliability backplane assembly using modern technology rather than traditional build to print requirements.  The new backplane assembly will replace the current backplane assembly (NSN 5998-01-496-7982FJ, P/N: 10-47990-01).  
Interested parties are requested to submit two copies of a summary of their capabilities and facilities that will allow them to manufacture a new backplane assembly.  A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and an estimate of the anticipated time between contract award and first flight article delivery are also solicited to aid in the budgeting process.  The ROM is for planning purposes only and the contractor will not be bound by these preliminary estimates.  This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that procurement will be accomplished. The government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.
Written responses must be submitted by 31 August 2005 to OO-ALC/LGKE, ATTN:  Lorraine Vernon, Bldg 1215, 6050 Gum Lane, Hill AFB, Utah 84056-5825.  No telephone or Fax responses will be accepted.
For answers to technical questions please contact Mr. Dan Wrobel at (801) 777-6813, email dan.wrobel@hill.af.mil. For contractual questions please contact Ms. Lorraine Vernon at (801) 777-0135, email lorraine.vernon@hill.af.mil.

<DESC>Evaluation of the Ministry of Agriculture Extension services, and the National Center of Agricultural Research and Transfer of Technology (NCARTT)


Extension Agricultural Economist and Extension Agronomist.

BACKGROUND:

NCARTT operates according to specials by-laws as a semiautonomous institution with administrative and financial independence from the Ministry of Agriculture.  NCARTT consists of a main headquarter located at Al-Hussein, the Agricultural Experiment Station at Baqa’a and six Regional Centers in Deir Alla, Ramtha, Khaldieh, Mushaqar Rabba, and Shoubak.  It operates 12 research stations representing different agro-ecological conditions in Jordan.

The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has the responsibility to deliver agricultural extension services.  They have a system of administration and implementation consisting of more than 120 employees for all of agriculture in Jordan.   The Directorate of Agricultural Extension operates through four divisions: Technical, Training and programming, Agricultural Information, and Evaluation Division.

NCARTT has responsibility also for extension and/or technology transfer.  They have a technology transfer component in their mission.  Typically they will provide some written information in leaflet form and deliver that material to MOA for dissemination.  Most of those materials are dates, general in their focus and limited in scope.  NCARTT is the leading agricultural research group in Jordan and they have some success in technology transfer through these written publications, field days for farmers and on farm trials.  There was a general feeling that they were not as active as necessary and their work was not always applicable to the farming community, but they did provide and could provide valuable services.  However, there was a strong sense from those interviewed that the work of NCARTT was not applicable in its focus and that the likelihood of successful outreach would be further limited because of the nature of the information being generated.

Much of the success of a review depends on the planning and preparation on the part of NCARTT and Extension Directorate prior to the reviewers’ site visit.  Advanced planning assures that objectives are met; that the most relevant materials are prepared and distributed to the evaluation teams prior to the review, and that time is appropriately managed during the conduct of the review.  The Institutional Administrator, in consultation with the ARS team leader, will determine the selection of functions and topics to be addressed in the reviews. 


Page 2

PURPOSE:

1.Review NCARTT’s mission, vision for the future, and strategic plan for achieving their goals.	

2.Review NCARTT’s mandate and Jordan’s agricultural research policies, under which NCARTT operates.

3.Evaluate the present staffing and future staffing plan in relation to the mission, vision and strategic plan.

4.Evaluate the status and accomplishments of NCARTT’s present programs and their effectiveness in moving the organization in the directions defined by the strategic plan.

5.Review the extension department of MOA, its mandate, responsibilities, present and future staffing plan, infrastructure, facilities, budget, authorities and the effectiveness of its program.

6.Assess the advantages and disadvantages of having extension services provided by MOA vs. other potential providers, such as NCARTT and Universities.

7.Provide reasonable recommendations with implementation potential and constructive critique regarding programs and direction to expand program excellence in NCARTT and to establish to functional extension system in Jordan that is responsive to farmer’s needs.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement to conduct conceptual design and analysis studies and develops technologies to support space exploration. Analytical activities involve researching available technologies, developing forecasts, and producing physics based spreadsheet models and operations simulations. Conceptual design activities involve the creation of computer aided design models, conducting discipline oriented analysis, and refining the designs based on the analysis. Technology development activities involve prototype development, conducting experiments to collect data, and applying the data to the physics based spreadsheet models. This statement of work (SoW) defines tasks to support these activities. Scope Tasks in this SoW involve literature searches about state of the art technologies, determining state of the art parameters, and forecasting the parameters, such as Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Research and Development Degree of Difficulty (RD^3), over the next 25 years. Requirements for the research effort derive from discussions with members and contractors that support the Advanced Projects team within SP20. Forecasts for future performance, operations, and programmatic parameters should be based on technology trends over the past decade. Other efforts involve reviewing and commenting on project related documentation. Task 1 Technology Data & Operations Research Research previous space projects to collect performance, operations, and programmatic parameters for technologies related to propulsion, structures, docking, environmental control and life  support systems, avionics, thermal control, energy storage, and other subsystems and components. Coordinate research efforts with the Sverdrup systems engineers that support SP20. Determine the process for obtaining a copy of the NASA Air Force Cost Model (NAFCOM) to identify potential historical projects. The NAFCOM database contains a wealth of programmatic data, which might include documentation that provides programmatic and operations data. Work with the Advanced Technology Lifecycle Analysis System (ATLAS) development team to get an account to the Technology Tool Box (TTB). Build a library of documents along with a bibliography, and provide the technology data in a format compatible with the TTB. Task 2 Technology Assessments Technology assessments shall include forecasts based on research conducted in Task 1.  Technology forecasts shall include state-of-the-art numbers with educated guesses about the performance, operations, and programmatic parameters over the next twenty years. Task 3 Project Documentation Reviews Efforts in this task involve reviewing and commenting on documentation produced by the SP20 project teams. Document reviews shall include comments in Microsoft Word documents that SP20 personnel and contractors can track and incorporate into final products. Deliverables 1)	A collection of historical documents related to previous NASA projects and a bibliography. 2)	Historical technology data, state-of-the-art performance and operations data, and extrapolated technology trends for exploration systems, subsystems, and components. 3)	Recommended revisions to project documentation. 4)	Monthly status reports on the number of documents researched, number of technology records produced, and number of documents reviewed.

The DVRS has a dual purpose (i.e., recording of pre-alarm images, and recording of the images from the cameras during an alarm). The resolution has to be such that recognition of the face of individuals is easy. This shall enable the Site Security Center (SSC) operators to analyze alarms including the events immediately preceding them.

Monitors developments associated with U.S. assistance to Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Facilitates release of funds to these countries.

•	Comprehensive knowledge of USAID's country program strategy and planning systems, with particular reference to FREEDOM Support Act requirements, as well as a thorough working knowledge of the Agency’s project design and implementation systems.

•	Thorough working knowledge of U.S. foreign aid legislation and trends and Executive Branch policies and directions.

•	Knowledge of relevant economic and social issues of assigned countries.

•	Solid knowledge of USAID management systems and administrative procedures.

•	Strong skill in adapting analytical techniques and evaluation criteria to the identification, consideration, and resolution of issues and problems of a procedural and factual nature.

•	Strong skill in conducting interviews with supervisors and employees to obtain information about organizational missions, functions and work procedures.

*Note – PSCs may represent the agency, except that communications that reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision of the agency must be cleared by a US Direct Hire employee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS

Under the supervision and policy direction of the Office Director, the incumbent has a degree of independence to act within overall Agency and Bureau policies and objectives and is held accountable for timeliness and quality of finished products.  The incumbent coordinates and monitors Caucasus programs both at the policy/strategy level and on a daily basis. The supervisor furnishes advice and guidance in problem cases, reviews work products for technical adequacy and conformance to policy, and evaluates overall effectiveness in terms of contributions to established goals.  The employee plans, coordinates, and carries out the successive steps in accordance with accepted office policies, applicable precedents, organizational concepts, management theory, and occupational training.  


GUIDELINES

Guidelines include laws and legislative initiatives, Agency rules and regulations, US government foreign and domestic policy directives, country-specific policies, and strategy and program planning issues, which are subject to interpretation.  Incumbent is expected to use independent judgment in determining the application of current foreign assistance legislative provisions and executive policies to assigned responsibilities. The employee must use independent judgment in researching regulations and in determining the relationship between guidelines and organizational efficiency, program effectiveness, or employee productivity.


COMPLEXITY

Work includes technical analysis, particularly economic policy review, country strategy formulation, project proposal analysis and program implementation review. The necessary analytical role requires awareness of U.S. Government political complexities and changing host country circumstances.  Tasks often require departing from past approaches and dealing with unstructured circumstances. Task objectives may depend on an assessment of competing demands.  Experienced judgment is needed to provide appropriate advice for E&E management. The myriad pressures for access to the program and decision-makers create an unusual combination of technical, administrative and policy issues at all times. 





SCOPE AND EFFECT

The expertise provided by the incumbent contributes to Mission analysis and identification of the key economic and social problems in the Caucasus region.  His or her input helps to define what is appropriate for USAID’s attention and guides the development of strategic and project approaches.  Such input keeps the Mission abreast of Washington agencies’ views of the region. The incumbent's findings and recommendations are vetted with the Office Director and senior E&E management.  These findings and recommendations heavily influence the position that the Agency takes regarding program strategy, composition and funding.


PERSONAL CONTACTS

Incumbent maintains close contact with appropriate staff in the field, the E&E Bureau, and central bureaus, in particular Global and Legislative and Public Affairs.  Outside contacts are with staff of the State Department Office of the Coordinator for U.S. Assistance for Europe and Eurasia, and other State Department offices and bureaus.  The incumbent will also have frequent contact with high government officials, host country representatives and NGO's.  Host country embassy contacts are often at the ministerial level and include ambassadors.  Frequent contacts are also made with the IMF and World Bank officers in charge of specific country programs for these institutions.  Public contacts are extensive, and may include association leaders, corporate officers, lobbyists, diaspora group members, university representatives, and non-profit foundation executives.


PURPOSE OF CONTACTS

The purpose of contacts is to cooperate with colleagues and counterparts to assure the completion of necessary actions, to advocate specific positions and to explain and/or justify U.S. Government policy position.  Contacts typically involve such matters as: identification of decision-making alternatives; appraisals of success in meeting goals; and recommendations for resolving problems. Incumbent must be skilled in negotiating and presenting policy/strategy options and in effecting a consensus on solutions.


PHYSCIAL DEMANDS

The work is essentially sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.




WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is performed in an office setting.  Occasional requirements for field trips could expose the incumbent to disease, challenging work conditions, and security risks. 

SUPERVISION/OVERSIGHT OF OTHERS

Incumbent provides guidance to two Caucasus Region desk officers.  One is responsible for Georgia and Azerbaijan.  The other desk officer is responsible for Armenia.  As a Team Leader, the incumbent’s leadership, technical and program management skills coupled with hands-on experience are important to ensure that the desk officers can perform their functions in a highly efficient and knowledgeable manner.

Business Service Center Contractor

The Joint Contracting Command – Iraq/Afghanistan (JCC-I/A) has a three-phased requirement to promote and expand a competitive and efficient private sector in Iraq.  The program will assist in the development of self-sustaining, Iraqi-managed business centers in Iraq.  Self-sustainability is a key focus and cannot be over-emphasized; it is paramount and must underlie all of the activities.  During phase one the Contractor will develop a comprehensive Manual of Best Practices for business centers specifically suited for business in Iraq.  During phase two the contractor will use the Manual as a guide to evaluate, identify any shortfalls, implement best practices and develop new services to improve the quality of services available at the established business center in Kirkuk and a new business center in Baghdad.  The new Baghdad business center must build a clientele and establish a fee structure that will cover the costs of its operation during this contract period.  This goal will have an impact on the clients served and the level of training and support services.  The contractor will develop “Best Practices” guidance to assist in achievement of business center self-sustainment. The design and completion of a survey and creation of a database of businesses and business associations requirement will assist in developing a marketing and outreach program for the business centers.  This survey and database will target the cities and surrounding areas where the business centers are located, i.e. Kirkuk and Baghdad.  The survey will assist in identifying the appropriate target market for the two business centers to expand and will provide an important start for the phase three development of the National Business Alliance.  The contractor will develop an umbrella organization to which potentially all business centers and other business associations belong and develop said organization into the National Business Alliance (NBA).  The Contractor shall identify ways that the NBA will become the entity that creates synergies among all Iraqi business centers and more importantly is a voice for private sector entrepreneurs to the national government.  The Contractor will build the NBA into a powerful business-supported organization that focuses its efforts on articulating the needs and issues confronting the private sector in Iraq.  Additionally, the NBA will create links to the Asian, European, and Americas regions to develop strong business ties for the exchange of ideas, goods, and services.  The Contractor must act in keeping with the objective of evolving business centers into self-sustaining Iraqi organizations – independently managed and operated by Iraqis for the benefit of the Iraqi business community.  The Contracting Officer intends to award to the best-qualified contractor capable of providing the services described in the Performance Work Statement.  The selected contractor will represent the best overall value to the Government providing superior capabilities as determined by an integrated assessment of criteria designed to determine which proposal offers the best prospect for effectively accomplishing all requirements.  Interested parties should contact Maureen Ecker by e-mail maureen.ecker@us.army.mil for a copy of the RFP.

<DESC>Listed below are technical questions and answers that may help you in preparing your solicitation.  The technical requirements are listed after the questions.  To see the Lessons Learned marketing plan, please go to: ftp://ftp2.fs.fed.us/incoming/nartc/Lessons_Learned_Center/   (It is in the documents folder) Are there required programming and/or server technologies that are required?  Windows based operating system. (See attached requirements).   Can this be chosen by the contractor? No, this is already in place. What is the current platform (Windows or Linux) and what languages were used in developing the current website?  Windows   Microsoft.net language Where are the conferences and meetings typically held, and what is the typical (or expected) duration?  Approximately two face to face meetings per year and monthly update conference calls.  Face to face meetings will be all day meetings and monthly conference calls should be 2-3 hours in length. Is the travel and conference usually per diem or fixed price part of the contract?  Travel and conference should be Government per diem rate for the location.  This can be billed separately after completion of requested travel. Are we to create, present and/or staff a display for marketing at the conferences?  No, the Wildland Lessons Learned Center display will be used. In Benchmark Research and Safety's work, did they do any budget projections? Yes, they did both budget and manpower projections as part of the proposal they submitted for the prototype work.   Place of performance is stated as "Boise, ID," will all staff be located there?  No.  A portion?  No.  Can this work be performed from another location?  Yes, the contractor can perform their work from a remote location.  The Wildland Fire Lessons Learned Center staff is located in Tucson, AZ. The RFP is titled "Lessons Learned Website design and maintenance",  though the tasks list doesn't specify many design-related tasks.  In  reviewing both sites, we have a number of design, user interface and  user experience improvements we are interested in proposing -- we feel  that there are a number of aspects of the sites that will be  detrimental to their popularity as well as the amount of publicity and  interest they receive. To what level is the NPS open to redesigning  these web sites, reimplementing some of the dynamic features, and  improving the overall structure and information architecture of these  web sites?  The Lessons Learned Center staff is open to improvement to the visual design and dynamic features of the site.  The Web Site is centered around a knowledge management system culture for community of practices rather than on a architecture  driven system. Is this RFP for Phase 2 only, or Phase 2 and beyond?  The RFP is for all phases. What are the current technical requirements of the web sites -- e.g.  what database(s) does it use, what middleware or web applications  technologies does it employ (we noticed ASP is being used)? See Web site requirements attachment.  Is the "Copernic Enterprise Search" software housed locally on the current server, and if so does the NPS own the license for it? Yes, the Copernics Enterprise Search is housed on the current server.  No the NPS does not own a license, Copernics is free for up to 5,000 documents.  With regards to these technologies, is the NPS open to augmenting or  replacing them with equivalent or better technologies? Similarly, we  infer from the use of ASP that these sites are likely hosted on a  Windows platform. Technologies permitting, is the NPS flexible on the  platform these sites are hosted on?  Please see Web site requirements attachment. Would you be able to provide a synopsis of the overall mission and  goals of the web sites? This is described in detail at: http://www.wildfirelessons.net/AboutLLC.aspx   What sort of impact have these two sites had on the wildfire community to date?  The Lessons Learned Center is three years old.  The widlfirelessons.net site will be operational for three years in Sept. 05.  The myfirecommunity.net has been operational for one year.  The two sites combined receive an average of 500 visitors daily. What sort of traffic levels do these two sites currently see?  500 visitors per day (combined) With regards to the fire science editor, will this position be  managed by the contracting firm or by the NPS? The fire science editor will be managed by the contractor.  Will it fall under the budget of the contracting firm or the NPS?   It should be in the contractor's budget.  Are there requirements for it being contracted, part time or full time?  The contracted position should be full-time if possible, part-time as an option. How much space do the two sites require on their respective servers?  See web site requirement attachment. Please provide some details on the ways in which parts of  wildfirelessons.net are generated from "the KMS database." Our  understanding of the term KMS database is the Key Management Service in  Windows, but to the best of our knowledge that doesn't provide any  content generation services.  KMS stands for Knowledge Management System.  The MyFireCommunity database is on Sequel. To clarify, the hosting portion of this RFP requires purchase,  configuration and hosting of a dedicated server?  The contractor should include the monthly hosting costs in their proposal.   The hosting fees include a service agreement with Empire Data Technologies.   Is the NPS open to options regarding this as well? For example, we may recommend evaluation of the current traffic and processor loads on the server in order to ascertain whether a full, dedicated server is indeed  necessary. Today's servers are quite powerful and capacitous, and can be overkill for any site that is not subject to very large traffic loads. This has already been analyzed and evaluated. First, I'm unclear as to whether you're looking for a redesign of these  web sites or for additional functionality to be added to the existing  sites. Our feeling is that we could make some significant improvements  to the design, but I wanted to get a sense for what the NPS is open to  within the scope of this RFP.  The Lessons Learned Center is not looking for a redesign of the prototype website but is open to design and functionality improvements. One thing I noticed was that the "Place of Performance" was Boise, ID.  Does this mean we would have to be on site?  The work can be done from a remote location with the exception of two face to face meetings per year. These meetings can be billed separately from the proposal at completion of requested meeting, following Federal Per diem rates. Is it your intent to provide a new form SF 1449 to replace the cancelled SF 1449 under N9560050009?  If not, can we assume based upon FAR 52.212-1(b) that the items 1 thru 11 can be provided either in our Response or in our cover letter?  This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  There will be no new SF1449.  Responses should include a separate package for pricing and another for the technical proposal. Also, where would you like the price (dollar amount & breakdown) submitted?  Does that price breakdown go on SF 1449, or can we simply add it to our Response? It is not typically our experience to include the price in the Response, but rather cost bids are sealed in a separate envelope.  Therefore, we are just verifying that our interpretation of the price submission procedure is accurate, and that including it in our Response is appropriate.  Pricing should be separate if possible, making clear pricing proposals for each line item requested. Is there a particular format you would like us to use for our response; are there any forms you would like us to fill out? No particular format required.    Is there a budget target or budget range for this project? Approximately $330,000 per year. Is there an incumbent contractor for this project or was the work on Phase 1 done internally? Benchmark Research and Safety, Moscow ID was awarded the Phase 1: Initial Pilot Project. Are you envisioning two full time positions: a fire science editor/analyst and a content developer/MFC website promoter/spokesperson   Fire science editor/analyst would be preferred full time, other positions focused on the communities of practice/web site work can be part-time. Do you want these people to be government employees or our employees? Contract employees, and included as part of your proposal. Do you have determined GS levels or salary ranges for these positions?  You are free to pay your staffing as you deem appropriate.  No mandatory wage rates apply since these positions are professional in nature. Is attending 4-5 meetings in Great Basin and Southern region the scope of the marketing/promoting the website activities or would you like to see a plan for further promotion ideas? This is within the scope of the communication/marketing plan. Are there custom applications that are on the server that will need to be migrated?  Not unless servers were changed.   The Lessons Learned Center does not anticipate this happening in the near future.  What 3rd party software needs to be supported or installed on the server?  What 3rd party services are integrated into the site?  What platform is the site currently hosted on?  What type of database is being used for the website?  What scripting languages are being used on the website?  Will email hosting need to be included as well?  See website requirements attachment. Is there a content management system in place? Yes, it is already in place in MyFireCommunity.net Who will have access to the webserver? Contractor and Lessons Learned Center staff.  Vendors, etc. What type of access is required?  What type of search engine is in place on the website? Copernics. How many decision makers will be involved on this project?  Two.  The Lessons Learned Center manager and assistant manager, both located in Tucson, AZ.  If more than one, will they be in different geographic locations? What do you envision as success for this site?  Increasing number of wildland fire communities of practice use the sites.  What do you wish to achieve/accomplish with and through the Web site?  Improve safe work performance through organizational learning.  Improve knowledge sharing and exchange among wildland fire professionals.  Will we have access to gain knowledge from the contractor who conducted the pilot project to ensure a streamlined transition to the full project?  Yes. Do you have a budget for this project?  Proposed budget is approximately $330,000 per year. It is our assumption that this project will include enhancements and additions to the current www.myfirecommunity.net.  Is this correct?  Yes. Do you have a preference for a Content Management System?  This is already in place. How much content do you have?   Approximately 1300 documents. Can you describe your content?  How is it categorized?  What format is it in (video, audio, PDF, etc.)?  This can be seen at: http://www.wildfirelessons.net/Library.aspx Format is pdf, jpeg, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, video clips in the near future.  Do you need to manage documents (files) as well as text?  Yes. How many people will add content to the site?  Mainly the Assistant Center Manager and Center Manager but also MyFireCommunity.net users once they have signed in with a password. Most content will need to be approved by the Lessons Learned Center before posting.   Does this person(s) know HTML?  Assistant Center Manager is trained in HTML.  Do you need any kind of workflow? Do they plan to migrate content?  If no, what particular areas will not be migrated to the new site?  Most migration has been accomplished. How do you currently manage the password protected areas of the site and how do you intend to manage this?  For example:  how will you handle tasks such as: creating new accounts, changing passwords, sending password reminders, removing permissions, etc.  This was set up in the Phase 1 contract and the contractor would continue with these tasks in Phase 2 and beyond. Do you have any third parties that provide content to the site and/or do you syndicate content? Yes.  Community of practice members will provide content as described above.  Do you need the contractor to host your site or do you plan on hosting it internally? Contractor will continue to host the sites. If you will host the site internally, please specify the Internet technology that your ISP currently provides. (e.g. Unix, Windows, Apache, IIS, PHP, MySQL, ColdFusion)  Do you know the version numbers?  For example ColdFusion MX or ColdFusion 4.5?  N/A. Will our technical team have full access to the server for the pilot project site?  Yes. Is their current database solution integrated with the Web site?  If yes, what is the current system?  If not, would you like that capability included with the redesigned site?  Yes.  Please see web site requirements attachment. Do you have any current data in a system?  If so, do you want that migrated to the new system and will you require any data services such as de-duplicating and other list cleaning services?  Data is already in the MyFireCommunity database.  Data services may be needed intermittently. Do they have any audio/video needs? Yes.  We want to be able to post video clips on the Web sites.  Do they have audio/video on the current site? No.  What formats do they need (Windows/Real/QuickTime)?  Windows. Who are their target audiences and what are the messages to be conveyed to each? The specific target audiences are described in each Phase.  The general target audience is the wildland fire professional.   If there are multiple target audiences what is the priority ranking?   Phase 1) What meta fields would you like the "advanced search" to be able to query?  The fields already set up in the Copernics advanced search engine.  Phase 1) How many categories of content are there?  This can be viewed at: http://www.wildfirelessons.net/Library.aspx Is there any relationship between content categories (e.g. sub-categories) or are they separate entities?  Subcategory content is also included in 1st level category content. 2.2.3) Please describe in further detail the needs for the Marketing Tool Kit.  Is this for the contractor to develop from scratch or is there already a structure in place?  If so, please elaborate?  What types of "marketing activities" do you want to perform (i.e. advertising, email campaigns, send-to-friend games, etc.)?  See Communication Plan attachment. 2.3) Are the MyFireScience library and knowledge products just content or are you looking for a more involved process/function that allows the research community and fire management practitioners to communicate (e.g. workflow, broadcast, etc)?  Proposal is for content products and tools.   2.3.1.1) What types of reviews will end users be providing?  Text feedback?  Rankings?  Etc.  Primarily text feedback on the fire science documents. 2.4) What is your "Communications & Evaluation Strategy"?  See Communication Plan attachment.  What are the goals of this strategy?  Will you need a CRM system?  No. Regarding "creating new video venues." Is venue a location not found within www.myfirecommunity.net requiring a new URL?  No.  Video clips should be part of the current Web sites. Will wildfirelessons.net require alterations to the design and interface during the "Enhanced Integration" of wildfirelessons.net and myfirecommunity.net?  No. If I read the RFP correctly, the base year is FY2005, which will end September 30, 2005.  Given that proposals are due July 15, when does NPS expect to announce awards?  It seems there will be a compressed time period in which to accomplish the base year tasks; we'd like to get a better sense of how compressed the base year will be.   Base year will be awarded in FY 2005.  Completion will be into the next fiscal year.    Will you be serving as the POC for technical and business questions regarding the RFP, or is there someone else we should contact to pose such questions? All questions should be directed to me at dell_mccann@nps.gov How many unique visitors access both sites per month? Approximately 500 unique visitors per month for both sites.  Will help us plan for the hosting infrastructure.  What are the traffic projections for the next 1-3 years?  600-800 visitors per day. What was the contract value of the pilot project? $232,000.  Is Benchmark, Research and Safety bidding on this solicitation as well?  They are free to bid on this solicitation if they desire. Are there any SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for program support and hosting?  The agreement is with Empire Data Technologies. Can we send the proposal via email? Yes, proposals can be submitted via e-mail to dell_mccann@nps.gov by Aug. 16, 2005. Do you have a strict schedule for the rollout of each phase? If so, please provide. Each phase should be completed within 10 months of task and funds allocation. Could you provide the exact weighting of importance for each Factor described in the RFP (percentages)? (If defined)  As stated in the RFP, the non-price factors are approximately equal.  Price is less important than the combined non-price factors. Please provide technical details, at your discretion, about the current myFireCommunity.net website (i.e., server setup, database used, data structure, architecture, programming languages used).  Please see Web site Requirements attachment. Do you have a defined budget for each phase of the project. If not, provide any additional budget requirements, if any.  Approximately 330,000 per year for all tasks in each Phase (if funding is received). How do you prefer we break out our budgets? By Phase? By Overall Task, i.e. 2.1, 2.2?  Please break out by Phase, Task and Sub-Task. In developing the My Fire Science Library and knowledge products (task 2.3), is the expectation that the material will be mostly previously published, mostly commissioned by us, or some combination?  If it is a combination, approximately what percentage is expected to be new material?  All knowledge products will come from fire science research community.  It will all be new material for the Web sites. Will the contracting agency provide the contractor access to contacts on existing FUMTs, IMTs and other teams, or shall the contractor reach out through the existing site and/or other means to recruit new site users and contributors? Lessons Learned Center staff will provide access to the Incident Management Team and other wildland fire personnel. Regarding task 2.3.2, is the Editor/Analyst expected to be a full-time hire by the contractor?  Can this person be issued a subcontract?  Preferably full-time, hired and managed by the contractor, in cooperation with the Lessons Learned Center. Again regarding task 2.3.2, how will the determination be made each year as to whether one or up to four online distance learning tools is developed for the coming contract year?  The determination will be made jointly by the Contractor, Fire Science Editor and Lessons Learned Center staff based on needs of the fire community. Regarding task 2.4.3, is content-sharing the intended result of creating partnerships with journals or other web references?  Yes, improved knowledge sharing is the intended result.  If not, what is the intention? Regarding task 2.5, do you expect wildfirelessons.net to be moved to the same server as myFireCommunity.net (if not already on the same server). Please provide technical information on the wildfirelessons.net site.  Both Web sites are currently on the same server.  Please see Web site Requirements attachment. Regarding task 2.5.1, provide details on the KMS database (is it an SQL database, structure, where it lives, etc.)  SQL Server 2000.  Please see Web site Requirements attachment. In the tasks for the web development project, I noticed this statement: "Upgrade the Search engine capacity to 10K documents. " Are these web pages, or some other type of document? (PDF, DOC, etc) Documents are pdf, jpeg, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, Microsoft Excel, video clips will be added in the near future.

The data center features multiple OC-3 Internet connections, multiple metropolitan OC-48 SONET rings and multiple electrical power feeds with additional backup power generation. They have multiple, isolated, redundant connections directly to internet backbone providers, and they use Border Gate Protocol (BGP) on our redundant routers. This configuration allows the facility to insure that a failure within the network backbone provider is automatically detected and re-routed with minimum packet loss and transparency to the end user.  Any future hosting solution will meet similar requirements.

<DESC>There are four (4) purposes for this Amendment #3.  First, quotations must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) on Monday, August 8th.  This extends the date of August 3, 2005, referenced in the July 29th posting of Amendment #2.  

Second, this Amendment reiterates that no more questions (whether telephonically or electronically, etc.) can be accepted and/or answered.  

Third, this Amendment revises the evaluation criteria as follows:  

(1) Technical Proposal/Ability to Comply with the requirements outlined in the solicitation/synopsis; (2) Price Proposals; and (3) Past Performance/References. 

Regarding #1, submit roster/list of mediator(s), with corresponding resume(s).

Regarding #2, the price proposal should include both hourly rate and daily rate.   
 
Regarding #3 (Past Performance/References), include three (3) recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items along with contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and either e-mail addresses and/or fax numbers.

Fourth, this Amendment answers questions received by the July 26, 2005, 3:00 PM EST deadline:  

Is your firm-fixed price RFQ based on a fixed number of hours per case? 

No, please indicate an hourly rate and a daily rate.

Should our costing be done by referral, per hour, or per day of mediation? 

Please include an hourly rate and daily rate.

How are situations handled when mediations require additional sessions beyond what was originally anticipated?  

Mediations should continue until resolution or agreement to not mediate is agreed upon.

What level of capacity in terms of weekly referrals do you anticipate each contract winner receiving? 

The average over the past year has been 2 mediations per month.  However, we cannot guarantee that will hold true for this contract.     

In the RFQ, it looks like travel costs are reimbursed by DHS as separate from payments for the actual mediation work. Should travel costs then be considered separate and thus not estimated as part of our quote?  

Yes, travel costs will be considered separately and should not be estimated as part of the quote.

Is utilization of coaching in terms of client behaviors and attitudes as they relate to conflict appropriate within the guidelines of the contract?  

You should include your method of mediation services in your technical proposal.

Are there specific language proficiencies required beyond English? 

Not at this time

Can you provide examples (attachments) of the paperwork you require the mediators to fill out?  Do you have standard forms that you use for the referral, for the settlement agreement, and the required evaluation?  

The awardee will provide mediation services to DHS Headquarters as well as organizational organizations such as Coast Guard, ICE, etc. As such, each organization has there internal form for settlement agreement and evaluation.  These particulars will be discussed after the award is made and will not be made available before such time.  

Can you also provide examples of what you mean by the term “DHS Language” in the context of the contract requirement: “The mediator will document resolutions through settlement agreements, which will include required DHS Language.” 

Same response as the answer directly above.  
 
In what format does the DHS desire for the statement of work, i.e. resume, specific answers to each numbered questions or some other format?  

IN WHICHEVER FORMAT THE VENDOR FEEL BEST CORRESPONDS TO THE COMBINED SOLICITATION/SYNOPSIS.  

What are the anticipated mediations per mediator volume for this contract? 

Average for the past year has been 2 mediations per month. However, we cannot guarantee that will hold true for this contract.     

Does DHS currently contract with anyone for this service?  If so, at what price and how many contractors are there?  

YES.  THE PRICE AND NUMBER OF CONTRACTORS WILL NOT BE DISCLOSED.  
  
How will the DHS negotiate travel for contractors?  Specifically, will the contractor be required to advise of the need for reimbursement before accepting the case(s). 

Travel will be mutually agreed upon by DHS and the contractor. The contractor will be required to advise the need for reimbursement before accepting the case.  Travel costs will be considered separately and should not be estimated as part of the quote

How soon will the contractor be required to facilitate mediation after DHS notifies them of their need?  

Actual mediation dates and times will be mutually agreed upon by the parties involved in the mediation process, i.e., management and employee. 
 
Is the price a "per assignment/per case" price or is it a "per 
session" price?  

Please indicate an hourly rate and a daily rate.

Should the price be based on a specific session time: i.e., 
less than eight hours, more than eight hours, or is it one inclusive 
session price? 

Please indicate an hourly rate and a daily rate.

REGARDING 52.212-3 (j) I found this language on the internet. Is this language, standing by itself, correct and sufficient for this Proposal. If not where can I obtain the correct form and language? Must I sign or initial this, scan 
it and attach it to my submission? Or can I, "affirm and certify" the above is true and correct and type my name as part of an e-mail text 
submission? 

VENDORS should consult 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items via http://www.arnet.gov/far/

SUBMISSIONS:
Can I submit my Proposal just as an ascii text e-mail attachment?  

You can try that approach.  If DHS cannot open your quote, you will be contacted to re-send, maybe as a PDF, etc.     

Can I attach attach a resume and other documents as PDF files?  

YES 

My assumption is you would like an email to include qualifications, references, resume, etc. along with a quote to include the cost per mediation excluding travel costs.  Is this correct?     

This Amendment clarifies what is required to be submitted.  
 
I understand that the Place of Performance would vary. Do you have any more information as to the likely locations or sections of the country? Would you anticipate the possibility of mediations ever being in central VA (e.g,, Richmond)? I would assume that DC and the East Coast would be likely. 

DHS has offices nation-wide and mutually-agreed upon travel will vary.  No additional information is available.
 
Settlement agreements will require DHS language. Do you anticipate a training process to give mediators this knowledge or will there be a resource made available for self-training in this aspect?  

Specific language will vary for each organizational component within DHS.  The awardee will receive specifics on the language on a case-by-case basis.
 
Is this a new program or have you had a program in place that used external mediators? If this is a new program, what number of total mediation request do you anticipate in the October - September contract year? If this is an existing program, can you give me information on the size of the program with figures on the annual number of mediation requests, the number of completed mediations in a year, or anything else you can to reflect the size of the program? 

There is currently a program in place.  The average over the past year has been 2 mediations per month.  However, we cannot guarantee that will hold true for this contract.       

Regarding the above mentioned solicitation, should we submit a price quote per mediation or per day (daily mediation rate)?  

You should include a daily rate and hourly rate.

Where do I acquire paragraph (j) of 52.212-3 for submittal?  

Via http://www.arnet.gov/far/
 
The Solicitation requires a fixed price amount, however it references the requirement to negotiate travel expenses/costs attendant to requested mediation services.  Should I submit a reasonable travel $ figure in my bid or should this portion be disregarded and therefore be a cost element that will not be considered in this RFP? 

The travel cost element should not be included in your proposal.
 
What level of Insurance is required?    Can this insurance be acquired after receipt of a contract?  

For purposes of this contract, independent verification of insurance is not mandatory.   

Regarding requirement #4 (certification program)…is this certification program mandantory?  

Yes 

It is not clear to me whether you just want a price quote at this time or also a description of how we meet the criteria identified for mediators.  

You should include information required by the Combined Solicitation/Synopsis, as updated through this Amendment.  

Recognizing that past performance is an important aspect of the evaluation criteria, are professional references (names, addresses, telephone numbers and/or e-mail addresses) required, recommended, optional or acceptable?  

Providing three such references with addresses, telephone numbers and/or e-mail addresses is now required, as a result of this Amendment.  
 
Please estimate how many mediations may be undertaken by a successful offeror in the first year.  

Average for the past year has been 2 mediations per month. However, we cannot guarantee that will hold true for this contract.     

Please describe the geographic area that a Washington D.C. area offeror with no geographic limitations might be expected/allowed to service.  

DHS has offices nation wide.  Accordingliy, such geographic areas could be involved.  

How important is ethnic and gender diversity of mediators? 

DHS is seeking qualified mediation firms. 

In addition to the price quotation, how much detail, other than CV’s of mediators and certification that each meets the criteria in the Statement of Work, does the Department contemplate being included in an offeror’s response? 

You should include information required by the Combined Solicitation/Synopsis, as updated by this Amendment.   

Should we submit a roster/list of mediators that meet the 7 criteria required for consideration? 

Yes

Is there a minimum number of mediators required for submission/response? 

No

Are there other attachments that are required/would be helpful? 

You should submit all information requested in the combined solicitation/synopsis, as updated by this Amendment.  

For pricing, do you want a single price regardless of length of mediation, or do you want prices based on 1/2 day, full day, and more than full day sessions? 

You should submit an hourly rate and daily rate.

Is there a specific form that should be used in application?  

No.  Vendors should comply with the requirements of the Combined Solicitation/Synopsis, as updated by this Amendment.   

Should the fee be bid as a flat hourly( plus a convening fee) or a flat fee for the entire mediation process? 

Include hourly rate and daily rate.

Will the cases be awarded singly or bundled? 

Individually

How quickly after assignment must the mediation be completed? 

Upon mutually agreed upon time for management official and/or employees. 

Is the mediator responsible for writing the agreement and if so, is there a prescribed form? 

Yes.  There is no standard form. Individual guidance on a prescribed form will be addressed after the award is made.

Should the bid include specific areas of service or is the single bid applicable to the entire country? 

The single bid is applicable for the entire country.

Are these cases in the Formal or Informal stage ?  

It will vary, depending on each case, and each DHS organization.  

Will there be multiple issues ?  

There could be multiple issues.

Please you send me an electronic copy of the DHS paperwork required for mediation cases.  

The agreement to mediate will be provided to the awardee.  It will not be made available before then.  

Are there geographic limitations on services?  

No, such services may occur nationwide.  

What is the expected turn-around time (from date of assignment to the date the mediation occurs)? 

Will vary, expectation is that a mutually agreed upon date, time and location are handled in a timely manner.

What documents should accompany the response:
Cover Letter? optional
Resume of Mediator(s)? yes
Pricing? yes
paragraph (j) of FAR 52.212-3  See http://www.arnet.gov/far/ 
Anything else? You should submit all information requested in the combined solicitation/synopsis, as updated by this Amendment.
