<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<AWDNBR>VA687-C11500
<ARCHDATE>11072010
<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.  Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, Walla Walla, VAMC

2.  Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of copier maintenance and service on a cost per copy basis.  

These services have been provided under Purchase Order VA687-C05034 which expired 09/30/2010.

With the current workload I was unable to get a new contract in place prior to the expiration of the current purchase order.  I intend to award a bridging purchase order to cover these services while I am working on a base plus four (4) option year contract.  My intention is to award this bridge contract for a period of three (3) months with a three (3) month option to the incumbent, IKON Office Solutions effective 10/08/2010.

3.  Description of Supplies or Services: Maintenance and service of Canon and Ricoh copiers to include service from a certified technician, travel, transportation, parts, test equipment, maintenance materials, tools, drums and supplies (excluding paper and staples).

4.  Statutory Authority: .
	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;
	(x)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest
?
5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-2, "Unusual and Compelling Urgency".    Copier maintenance and repair is an important service provided to the medical center.  The timeliness and costs to repair inoperable copiers can be very extensive without a contract in place.  Parts, labor and toner are all included in these service contracts and ultimately end up saving the Government a considerable amount of money, especially when drums or electronic parts are needed to complete repairs.

Sample Repair Costs outside of Contract:
1.	Copier Drum Kit prices range from $300 - $500 
2.	Motherboard replacement parts average $500
3.	Toner Cartridges average about $100.00 each (per GSA Advantage Search)
4.	Plus the cost of the technicians hourly rate of  $22.32 (per SCA Wage Rates) - could be more

With the contract, we are also guaranteed a service turnaround time of 24 hours, without one, we run the risk of having copiers inoperable for days.  

This three (3) month bridge purchase order would allow enough time to obtain competitive quotes and put a long term contract in place.

6.  Actions to Promote Competition: During the three (3) month bridge, I intend to solicit for competitive quotes.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $9000.  The prices quoted by IKON Office Solutions for this bridging period are consistent with pricing from past years which has stayed between 0.0130 and 0.0080 cents per copy depending on the copy machine model.  

The pricing is considered fair and reasonable.

8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102): Market Survey not completed due to Unusual and Compelling Urgency

9.  Other Considerations: 

FAR 6.302-2(b)(2) states that "Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government".  

Repair costs without a contract in place could result in serious financial injury to the Government.

?
10.  Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  

N/A - bridge contract determined necessary by the CO and not at the request of the end user.
