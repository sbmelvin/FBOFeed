<DESC>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS FOR A SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION (REFERENCE FAR PART 13.106-1(b)) AS REQUIRED BY FAR PART 5.2.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION/PROPOSAL.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of this contract action deem only one source is reasonably available.  This requirement is considered noncommercial in nature and any resultant purchase order will be awarded in accordance with FAR Part 13. The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to award a sole source Fixed Price purchase order for the development of compact LVS and SVS whole air sampling system designs, using COTS components to the maximum extent possible, to meet unique Air Force requirements, to Mechtronic Solutions, Inc (CAGE Code: 1E3G6).  Systems are intended for ground, UAV or other airborne platforms.  Required specifications include weight less than 100 lbs for LVS and 50 lbs for SVS and footprint less than 36x30x30 and 18x18x36 respectively, while still maintaining large volume capacity/sampling capability.  Systems are to be modular, scalable, reliable, rugged, and rapidly adaptable to a variety of transportation platforms. Design must be completed within 3 months or award.  It is not anticipated that any other firm could complete this requirement without a substantial duplication of costs. The majority of the required design work for this requirement was procured by the Air Force on previous contracts. It is anticipated that a competing firm would incur significantly higher costs for the design, and would not be able to complete the design in the required time frame.  

Secret security clearances are required for contractor employees at time of award.   Solicitation FA2521-07-T0110 will be issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  It is advertised with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541330, with a size standard of $4.5M.   This acquisition will be conducted as a small business set-aside.  

Potential contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award (See Internet site: http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil).   It is mandatory to obtain a DUNS number prior to registering in CCR by calling Dun & Bradstreet (1-800-333-0505).  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  Any firm that believes it can meet the specifications above may give written notification to the point of contact below.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters Division, Patuxent River, MD intends to award a contract modification to a sole-source firm-fixed price purchase order to Honeywell International, Inc., Defense and Space Electronic Systems, Albuquerque, NM.  The original purchase order procured a quantity of 1,940 Intel Embedded Microcontrollers (P/N:  AN87C196KDF8) and provided for the storage of the units.  The intended contract modification will procure an additional 553 units of the Intel Embedded Microcontrollers.  The items will deliver and ship in place at the contractor owned facility in Albuquerque, NM and be stored in a facility for electronic devices.  The Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209) has a requirement to protect production and repair capability of the Advanced Mission Computer and Display (AMC&D) system, the mission system for the F/A-18 aircraft.  The Intel Embedded Microcontroller, a commercial component of the Advanced Multi-Purpose Display (AMPD), is going obsolete.  Additional emergent requirements for the AMPD necessitate the procurement of an additional life of type buy for this component.  There are no other known parts that meet form, fit and function replacement requirements.  Honeywell is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the AMPD, as well as the designated repair facility and, as such, is the only source capable of procuring, managing and storing this part to protect production and life cycle support of the AMPD.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).

<DESC>MOBILE MULTI-SENSOR TIME-SPACE-POSITION INFORMATION (TSPI) SYSTEM (MMTS)
SYNOPSIS
March 19, 2007

The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS), Instrumentation Management Office (IMO), located at 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826, in partnership with the Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC) has a requirement for a Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) to lead the design, development, integration, assembly, test, management, documentation and delivery of a Mobile Multi-sensor Time-Space-Position Information (TSPI) System (MMTS).   System characteristics include but are not limited to the following:  The system will be mobile, self contained except for power, and include all the necessary equipment for set-up, bore-sight, calibration and operation by a two-man crew without the use of heavy equipment.  The system will autonomously track low-flying (2 meters above ground) guided and unguided projectiles with velocities up to 2000 m/s for a range of at least10 km.  The system will provide continuous TSPI data with an accuracy of at least 100 micro-radians in azimuth and elevation and an accuracy of at least 1 meter in range at rate of at least 10 Hz. in real time.  The system will be capable of withstanding harsh weather for small periods of time and the capability to be slaved to a similar system.  The system must be transportable to support testing at other ranges.    

The MMTS program is a U.S. Army major technical test instrumentation project that will provide this required capability and will be designed to support the Test and Evaluation (T&E) of Department of Defense (DOD) weapons systems under the T&E mission area.  In order to perform that mission more efficiently and cost effectively, RTTC must enhance its TSPI tracking and data collection range instrumentation to properly conduct test and evaluation of low-flying, high speed projectiles.  Currently, Doppler radar tracking systems are unable to track missiles flying below 4 degrees to the horizon because of radar multi-path effects.  Optical-based TSPI instruments cannot provide range information.  Laser systems require retro-reflector materials attached to the projectile in order to have adequate signal-to-noise ratio to provide position information.  These materials separate from the projectile at hypervelocity speeds.  

This posting provides a draft Statement of Work (SOW), draft Performance Specification, and draft Contract Data Requirement List (CDRL) requirements.  Industry feedback concerning the draft documentation is highly encouraged.   The Government does not intend to respond to feedback provided in response to this synopsis.  The Government will incorporate applicable feedback into any resulting Request for Proposal and related Technical Documentation.    PEO STRI has made a determination to pursue the Mobile Multi-sensor Time-Space-Position Information (TSPI) System (MMTS) acquisition via a full and open small business set-aside competition under the authority of FAR 19.5 (Set-Aside for Small Business). This procurement is anticipated to be awarded on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) basis.  Any questions or feedback to this notice must be submitted by e-mail to Nancy Potts at nancy.potts@peostri.army.mil no later than April 3, 2007.  Please refer to RFP Number N61339-07-R-0036

The Government will not, under any circumstances, pay for any Bid & Proposals (B&P) costs for offerors who choose to prepare proposals in response to issuance of an RFP.

<DESC>This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award one Janitorial Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery combination contract to be performed at various Naval and Marine Corps installations located in Southern California.  This solicitation is restricted to 100% percent Small Business Concerns to be procured as a commercial items acquisition in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561720 and the size standard is $15 million dollars.  See explanation of size standards at the following website: http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/indexguide/index.html.  This procurement includes Award-Option incentives.  The Award-Option incentive is intended to motivate and reward high-level performance in executing the provisions of the contract, see the Award Option Plan attached to this solicitation.  The performance period will include a 12-month base period, four 12-month option periods, and five 12-month Award-Option terms, for a total maximum duration not to exceed 120 months.  THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE OFFERS AND AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFERORS (EXCEPT CLARIFICATIONS AS DESCRIBED IN FAR 15.306(A)).  THEREFORE, THE OFFERORS INITIAL OFFER SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERMS FROM A PRICE AND TECHNICAL STANDPOINT.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER LATER DETERMINES THEM TO BE NECESSARY.  IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE EXCEEDS THE NUMBER AT WHICH AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION CAN BE CONDUCTED, THE CONTRACTING OFFICER MAY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE TO THE GREATEST NUMBER THAT WILL PERMIT AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION AMONG THE MOST HIGHLY RATED PROPOSALS.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Relative Importance of Evaluation Factors: The evaluation factors are divided into two categories; non-price evaluation factors (Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and price (Factor 6).  Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, the non-priced Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are approximately equal to price, Factor 6.  The importance of price will increase if offerors non-price proposals are considered essentially equal in terms of technical quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal’s technical superiority to the Government.  Award will be made to the offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.  The evaluation factors are set forth below:
Factor 1: Experience
Factor 2: Past Performance
Factor 3: Technical Approach
Factor 4: Management
Factor 5: Safety
Factor 6: Price
Offeror shall submit its proposal in two (2) separate parts as follows:

1) Technical Proposal: (original & 4 copies).  Address each of the following evaluation factors shown in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation: Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5.

2) Price Proposal: (original & 4 copies).  Include all other Price Proposal submission requirements shown in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation.  Price proposal shall be submitted in a separate binder from the technical proposal, and clearly marked “Price Proposal”.  Offerors shall complete Exhibits A through K.  Option Period 1 through 4 and Award Options 1 through 5 include pricing for four service levels referred to as Common Output Levels 1 through 4.  OFFERORS SHALL COMPLETE ALL EXHIBIT LINE ITEM NUMBERS (ELINS) UNIT PRICES AND TOTAL AMOUNTS IN THE BASE YEAR AND FOR EACH COMMON OUTPUT LEVEL 1 THROUGH 4 IN EACH OPTION PERIOD AND AWARD OPTION PERIOD.  Only one Common Output Level will be awarded in each option period and Award Option Period, per ELIN.  Common Output Level 1 is the highest level of service, with COL 2, 3, and 4 being the lower level service.  The Government will award option periods and earned award option periods unilaterally.  

While all proposed pricing will be fully evaluated in accordance with RFP Factor 6, the Government will consider only the sum total of the prices proposed for the following Exhibit Line Item Numbers (ELINs) to determine reasonableness, realism, and completeness for the purpose of performing any required cost-technical trade-off analysis to determine the offeror proposing the best value to the Government: 

Base Year: 
FFP (ELINs A001 through A037)
IDIQ (ELINs A050 through A106)
Option 1:
FFP Common Output Level 1 (ELINs B001 through B037)
IDIQ (ELINs B050 through B106)
Option 2:
FFP Common Output Level 1 (ELINs C001 through C037)
IDIQ (ELINs C050 through C106)
Option 3:
FFP Common Output Level 1 (ELINs D001 through D037)
IDIQ (ELINs D050 through D106)
Option 4:

IDIQ (ELINs E050 through E106)
Award Option 1:
FFP Common Output Level 1 (ELINs F001 through F037)
IDIQ (ELINs F050 through F106)
Award Option 2:
FFP Common Output Level 1 (ELINs G001 through G037)
IDIQ (ELINs G050 through G006)
Award Option 3:
FFP Common Output Level 1 (ELINs H001 through H037)
IDIQ (ELINs H050 through H006)
Award Option 4:
FFP Common Output Level 1 (ELINs J001 through J037)
IDIQ (ELINs J050 through J006)
Award Option 5:
FFP Common Output Level 1 (ELINs K001 through K037)
IDIQ (ELINs K050 through K006)

In the event there is a difference between a unit price and the extended total amount, the unit price will be held to be the intended price and the total of the ELINs will be recomputed accordingly.  If the offeror provides a total amount for an ELIN but fails to enter the unit price, the total amount divided by the ELIN will be held to be the intended price.

AN OFFEROR WHOSE PROPOSAL IS ACCEPTED FOR AWARD WILL BE FIRMLY BOUND TO ALL OF ITS PROPOSED PRICING INCLUDING COMMON OUTPUT LEVELS 1 THROUGH 4, NOT JUST TO THOSE PRICES LISTED ABOVE WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY REQUIRED COST-TECHNICAL TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS."

<DESC>The Navy is seeking sources to enable the United States Navy and partner nations to increase and significantly improve maritime domain awareness in a selected Area of Responsibility (AOR).  The means of achieving this goal under the contract will be to apply a threat evaluation software program, fully compatible and interfaced with maritime detection data inputted from deployed equipment, tools, instruments, or other data sources, and authorized to operate in a military or a coalition network environment (non-classified or classified).   The threat evaluation program must enable the Navy and partner nations to detect, identify, and analyze the threat posed by vessels within the observed area.  

The contractor shall provide a computer-based threat evaluation system, together with any other complementary, associated, supporting, or bundled programs, that will analyze ocean-going cargo vessels for security implications in support of a comprehensive maritime domain awareness effort.  The system will utilize business rules developed in collaboration with coalition/Alliance partners, and approved by the US Navy, and access external data in order to produce accurate, in-depth, and reliable threat evaluation and analysis as well as realistic and practical recommendations for interdiction, boarding, or other appropriate action.  Features should also include:

	- accept AIS or other automatic data stream to identify and geolocate vessels;

	- allow specification of parameters controlling which vessels to evaluate (geographic bounds, flag state, vessel type or size, etc.);

	- access external data to discover vessel, crew, cargo and voyage data;

	- allow user-developed threat evaluation rules and scoring to be applied to data automatically;

	- display an operational picture with indications of threat status for all vessels, based on a logical combination of scores from the application of each threat evaluation rule;

	- allow “drill-down” to display logic behind the threat status for each vessel.

<CONTACT>Roberta J. Truax Contracting Officer 3039695582     roberta_j_truax@nbc.gov;
<DESC>The Department of Interior, National Business Center Request for Proposal, NBCR07010, Mineral Assessment and Market Analysis Report, is a solicitation for Fixed-Price Contract.  Solicitation number NBCR07008 applies and will be issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the following requirements: GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:  The purpose of this Contract is to obtain a well written, unbiased, logical, and supported mineral assessment and market analysis report reflecting current conditions within the Wind River Indian Reservation and surrounding area under analysis.  The contractor shall perform a complete self-contained mineral assessment and market analysis in accordance with the attached requirements.  The evaluation shall be conducted by an individual with an extended knowledge of mineral assessments and market analysis relevant to the Reservation and surrounding areas under analysis. The mineral assessment and market analysis report represents a two-fold analysis.  The mineral assessment portion establishes the baseline for what minerals occur, or are likely to occur, on the Reservation and what the level of reliability is for the identified minerals to be present.  The mineral assessment shall specifically identify on the maps for the Reservation and surrounding area the location of mineralized areas including known deposits, as well as areas where it is reasonable to expect that this mineralization continues, and areas of no mineralization (low to no mineral potential).  The burden is on the contractor to determine a reasonable economic radius around the Reservation that has the potential for affecting the value of the mineral content of the lands within the Reservation boundaries.  The mineral assessment portion of the report does not apply economic filters to the data (i.e., contractor shall not ascribe value to any deposits).  The second part of the report, the market analysis, provides analysis of the area markets for the commodities and any potential for developing the mineral resources that exist, or are highly likely to exist, within the Wind River Indian Reservation boundaries.  In addition, a calculation of mineral value should be made for those deposits where it is likely that the deposit would be developed.  All values contained within the report will be scrutinized during the review process.  All information used in the determination of mineralization and the possibility for development should be included.  The estimated start date is May 1, 2007.  This is a full and open competition.  The Government intends to award this contract on an all-or-none basis. Contractors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov in order to be eligible for award.  The solicitation will be made available at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about March 21, 2007.  The solicitation must be downloaded via the Internet, as hard copies will not be made available.  Please print the Standard form (SF-1449) and print all clauses and attachments. Proposals are due April 23, 2007 by 1:00 PM.  Proposal shall be submitted to the Department of the Interior, National Business Center; 7301 W. Mansfield Avenue; Mail Stop D-2941; Denver, CO 80227-2040; Attention: Roberta Truax.  Proposals shall include the following items:     1) Pricing Schedule; 2) Experience in performing mineral assessment and market analysis services, particularly mineral assessments and market analyses within the geographic region encompassed in the Statement of Work; 3) Past performance in performing mineral assessment and market analysis services; 4) Contractors are required to submit a minimum of three references for evaluation purposes; 5) Contractors shall submit brief narratives addressing (Items 1 and 2); 6)Completed 52.212-3 Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Nov 2006) (accessible at http://www.arnet.gov/far/), 5) Include TIN and DUNS Number, and 6) Offer must be signed. Award shall be made to the Contractor whose offer is determined to represent the best value to the Government, after considering technical evaluation, past performance, and price.  In making the best value determination, the Government considers the technical evaluation and past performance being equal in importance and both being more important than price.

<DESC>NASA/Johnson Space Center (JSC) has a requirement for the development of educational content and administration of the STS-118 Informal Educators and Trainers Workshop.  This conference is to be held in Houston June 4-5, 2007, for 30 NASA Museum Alliance Member Education Specialists.	 NASA/JSC intends to purchase this workshop from Space Center Houston (SCH) on a sole source basis.  Specific features of STS-118's educational content are a plant growth chamber engineering design challenge, a pennant design experience, and the Fit Explorer which challenges students to physically train like astronauts. SCH offers unique knowledge in space plant growth as they have a NASA excessed plant growth chamber which is maintained by a space farming expert. SCH also has a Living in Space exhibit which demonstrates the unique environment astronauts reside in on-orbit aboard the International Space Station. SCH's current programs and unique knowledge directly tie into the goals and objectives of STS-118 educational challenges. SCH also provides programs unique to the Space Exploration experience that feature space flight hardware simulation activities and educational programs specific to the Vision for Space Exploration.  Market research indicates that SCH is the only known source capable of providing the specific services to meet NASA/JSC's STS-118 educational content requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. CST on April 03, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has a requirement for 21, 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14 to control mosquitoes in outlying areas of KSC, where the use of aerial equipment is necessary to apply chemicals to areas impossible to spray without an aircraft.  Dibrom 14 is supplied annually by KSC to the Brevard County Mosquito Control District (BCMCD) in accordance with the Mosquito Control Agreement between KSC, Air Force Eastern Test Range, US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and Brevard County.   AMVAC Chemical Corporation, the manufacturer of Dibrom 14, has verified that Adapco, Incorporated of Sanford, Florida is the sole distributor of this product for the state of Florida.	Other authorized distributors are prohibited from distributing the product beyond their state or assigned territory. KSC intends to purchase the 21, 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14 from Adapco, Incorporated of Sanford, Florida. Dibrom 14 is an adulticide used to control mosquitoes.	There are several areas at the Launch Pads and Launch Complex 39, where normal chemicals used at KSC cannot be sprayed due to chemical corrosiveness and flight hardware.  Moreover, these areas are also very large and impossible to spray without an aircraft, which KSC does not possess.	The Mosquito Control Agreement provides the equipment (aircraft) to spray large areas of water in the KSC area to control mosquitoes without having to spray directly around the pads.  KSC procures and supplies the Dibrom 14 to BCMCD for spraying.  Dibrom 14 is the only chemical that can be used, because it is the only chemical BCMCD is licensed to spray in the KSC and impound areas. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 PM EST on Wednesday, April 4, 2007.

<DESC>EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) administers portions of Title II of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1977 and 1990. OTAQ?s responsibilities under Title II include setting emission standards for on- and off-highway mobile sources and assuring compliance with such standards; evaluating the emissions and fuel consumption characteristics of current and potential future on- and off-highway motor vehicles, motor vehicle engines, propulsion systems and components thereof; and assessing the effectiveness of current or potential future motor vehicle emission control systems. The objective of this solicitation is to provide OTAQ with broad emission testing support  for in-use vehicles and engines, and for in-use and alternative fuels that may become nationally available to the consumer over the next decade.  Alternative fuels include diesel fuel blends made with agricultural products (biodiesel) and gasoline blends with varied amounts of ethanol or other compounds. The performance work statement requires the contractor to perform:  Fuel Procurement, Processing, and Analyses,  Engine and Vehicle Testing, Vehicle and Equipment Emission and Activity Sampling, In-use Vehicle/Engine Recruitment, Data Processing and Quality Assurance Requirements. Such support may include;  compositional and/or other analysis of a specified fuel, testing, often on a short turnaround basis, any feasible combination of separate engine types, test types, vehicle/engine classes, and fuel types. Contractor shall have the ability to test, install, operate, retrieve and process the data from Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS) and Portable Activity Measurement Systems (PAMS), evaluate emission control systems or components thereof, obtain a statistically valid sample of a specified segment (may be categorized on the basis of geographic, political, temporal, functional and economic criteria) of the mobile source fleet for emission testing or emission sampling. Significant potential exists for conflicts of interest (COI) under this procurement.  Therefore, it is considered in the best interest of the Government to preclude from award consideration as a prime contractor or subcontractor, all automotive manufacturers (large or small-volume), all non-road vehicle and/or engine manufacturers, all oil companies (petroleum refiners, fuel manufacturers or distributers, fuel marketers).   Furthermore, all offerors will be required to submit a COI plan requiring them to identify the projects they are working on and explain how potential or actual Organizational Conflicts of Interests can be either mitigated, avoided, or neutralized.  The solicitation will contain the following provision; ?Industries Prohibited from being Considered for Award?.   The text of this clause will be as follows:  ?Whereas this procurement requires that the contractor provide support for development of regulations directly affecting all automotive manufacturers (large or small-volume) , all non-road vehicle and/or engine manufacturers, and all oil companies e.g., (petroleum refiners, fuel manufacturers or distributers, fuel marketers)., the Contracting Officer has determined that a significant COI will result. Therefore, all automotive manufacturers (large or small-volume) , all non-road vehicle and/or engine manufacturers, and all oil companies e.g., (petroleum refiners, fuel manufacturers or distributers, fuel marketers) will be considered ineligible for award of any contract resulting from this solicitation. The specific determination whether any other offeror is to be considered ineligible for award will be made by the Agency on a case by case basis.? The solicitation and resulting contract shall also contain the clause, "Limitation on Future Contracting."  The text of this clause will track with Limitation of Future Contracting, Alternative V (Headquarters Support), EPAAR 1552.209-74 (MAY 1994), except for paragraph (c).  Paragraph (c) of the clause shall read as follows: 	"Paragraph c:   Unless prior written approval is obtained from the EPA Contracting Officer, the contractor agrees not to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to the specific activities performed under this contract.  Specifically, the contractor may not enter into business or financial relationships with all automotive manufacturers (large or small-volume), all non-road vehicle and/or engine manufacturers,   all oil companies (petroleum refiners, fuel manufacturers or distributers, fuel marketers),  that are affected by the policies or regulations for which the contractor has provided, is providing, or has work assignments to provide support under this contract, if the purpose of the business or financial relationship is to contest, oppose, or otherwise influence such policies or regulations, or to avoid or circumvent their applicability.  These restrictions apply during the life of the contact, and extend for 3 years beyond the life of the contract. The Government anticipates award of a full and open competition, cost plus fixed fee term (LOE) contract with a twelve-month base term and four (4) twelve month options to extend the term.  The base level of effort for each term will consist of 10,524 direct labor hours. The Government anticipates including quantity option amounts of 10,520 direct labor hours for the Base and the option periods, which brings the maximum total potential on the contract to 105,220 direct labor hours over five (5) years. Copies of the solicitation will be available to all offerors on the Internet.  Offerors should visit the following EPA web page (http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd) for continuous update of RFP's status.  Hard copies will not be distributed. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to frequently check the EPA site for amendments.   The RFP is anticipated to be release in mid April 2007 and close thirty days thereafter.  The NAICS code is 541330.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY; THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), Superfund/RCRA Regional Procurement Operations Division (SRRPOD) will issue a solicitation for Targeted Brownfields Assessment Support for the EPA?s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) Office of Brownfields Cleanup and Redevelopment (OBCR) in accordance with FAR Part 15 procedures. The EPA OBCR seeks the support of a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) contractor with the necessary technical capabilities to perform Targeted Brownfields Assessments (TBAs) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-118). TBAs will consist of performing Phase I and/or Phase II environmental assessments at Brownfields sites throughout the United States.  Phase I environmental assessments shall be performed in accordance with EPA?s final regulations governing All Appropriate Inquiries (40 CFR 312) and ASTM International?s E1527-05 "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process," and governing State/Tribal regulations.  Phase II environmental assessments shall be performed in accordance with ASTM International?s E1903-97 (2002) "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Process," and other governing State/Tribal regulations. Depending on the extent of the investigations already performed at the site, or the findings of those investigations, the contractor may be tasked to perform either a Phase I or Phase II environmental assessment, or both.  A Phase I environmental assessment is a preliminary site inspection that includes among other things, a review of property uses and past ownerships, a review of relevant government records, a historical records investigation, and an on-site visual site inspection. The Phase I investigation, through a comprehensive records search and visual inspection, seeks to identify any Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) or conditions indicative of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances which may impact the property.  A Phase II environmental assessment is a more in depth site investigation that, in most cases, includes sampling and analysis to determine the type and extent of contamination present at the site. The Phase II guidelines direct the environmental professional to design the Phase II investigation according to the observations and findings of the Phase I investigation. Findings of the Phase I and Phase II environmental assessments will be used by EPA to enable property owners to determine future site actions. Additional information regarding TBAs can be found at http://www.epa.gov/brownfields/tba.htm. The contract(s) will be managed out of EPA?s ten Regional offices, which are located in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle and is (are) expected to be cost-plus-fixed-fee type. This solicitation will be competed as a TOTAL SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE in accordance with FAR 19.1405. This set-aside decision is FINAL. The SOW requirements fall under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620, Environmental Consulting.  In an effort to streamline the procurement process, and to utilize the internet and electronic communications to the maximum extent possible, the solicitation, and amendments, and other related items for this procurement will be posted at this website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod, with notice posted on fedbizopps.com. Solicitation PR-HQ-07-11297 will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or after April 06, 2007 with a due date of approximately 30 days following its release.  Interested offerors will be required to download the RFP and all related documents from this website. No printed copies of the RFP will be available and NO bidders list will be maintained. A draft SOW is posted at http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/hcsc/tba/index.htm. The Agency expects to finalize the SOW prior to release of the actual request for proposal. The point of contact for this procurement is Andrew Flanzer, U.S. EPA Contract Specialist. Please be advised that ALL questions regarding the content of the Request for Proposal, prior to its release, WILL BE IGNORED.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) intends to make multiple awards for the provision of residential re-entry programs for inmates at one or more pilot site institutions. .Proposals will be accepted from any Offeror.  Offerors are to submit proposals that include secular (i.e., non-religious) programming in nine life skills areas.  In the event that prisoners may prefer programs that include a religious perspective, an offeror, in carrying out the secular program objectives, may submit a proposal that contains religious programming, in addition to its independent secular programs.  The secular programming must be of equal quality to any programming with religious content that might be offered to the prisoner participants.  Failure to include a secular program that is of equal quality to any program with religious content will result in the proposal being ineligible for award. 

The pilot sites are as follows:  Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Seagoville, Low Security; Federal Correctional Complex Beaumont, Low Security facility; United States Penitentiary Hazelton, Secure Female Unit; FCI Fort Dix, Low Security; FCI Edgfield, Medium Security; and FCI Tucson, Medium Security.  Prospective Offerors shall be permitted to submit separate proposals for any or all of the pilot site locations.  The BOP reserves the right to place contract award(s) for services at up to six of its designated pilot institutions based upon evaluation of proposals.   Each site will accommodate only one program.  

The purpose of the residential re-entry program shall be to facilitate personal behavioral and attitudinal change for the participating inmates, and thereby reduce recidivism through promoting the virtues of productive work, respect for others, self-discovery, responsibility and accountability.  In addition, it is expected that this program will also contribute to overall prison safety and management.  The program shall encourage re-connection with family and community, and the development of healthy and productive habits of living.  The program shall match inmates with community organizations or similar support groups at their release destination, for the purpose of personal mentoring and enhancement of participants’ opportunities for successful community reintegration (i.e., employment, housing, avoidance of recidivism, etc.).

There are nine interdependent program areas linked to the goals of community reintegration and reduction of recidivism: 1) daily living; 2) mental health; 3) wellness; 4) interpersonal skills; 
5) academic; 6) cognitive; 7) vocational; 8) leisure time; 9) character.  The goals/areas are intended to form a framework for a program that will foster successful rehabilitation and reduction of recidivism by reinforcing the skills necessary for integration or reintegration into the release-destination community.  The contractor shall develop a curriculum that demonstrates consistency with program goals and outlines how the contractor plans to incorporate program components that foster growth in the nine program goal areas.  The contractor shall provide sufficient staffing to cover a rigorous schedule, comprised of daytime and evening programming during the week and on weekends for up to 130 inmate participants per site.

The BOP intends to conduct pre-proposal site visits at each of the six pilot site institutions.  Finalized pre-proposal site visit dates and times will be set out in the cover letter of the  solicitation document when posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, or will be issued as an Amendment to the solicitation after it is posted to FBO.

The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 624190, and the requirement is issued on an unrestricted basis.  A Firm-Fixed Price type contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods is anticipated for each pilot site.  The BOP anticipates the following regarding the periods of performance: Base Period of performance shall be from date of Notice to Proceed through 12 months; Option Period One shall be from 13 months through 24 months; Option Period Two shall be from 25 months through 36 months; Option Period Three shall be from 37 months through 48 months; and Option Period Four shall be from 49 months through 60 months.

The solicitation will be made available on or about March 31, 2007, and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunities website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available.  The website provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this website.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this website to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  The anticipated date for receipt of proposals is July 1, 2007, and the anticipated date of award is no later than December 31, 2007.  Faith-based and community-based organizations may submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for this procurement action.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to make the following changes to the Proposers Information Package (PIP):
 
The page count total for the ARGUS-IS BAA 07-23 technical proposal was increased by two pages, for the Evaluation Factors, as described in section H.2.8.  New page count totals can be found on page 36, section H.2. of the Proposer Information Package (PIP).  This change in page count does not change the due date for proposal submission.  The due date for proposal submission is 9 April 2007 (1300 EST) to be considered for the first round of funding.  While the proposals submitted after the initial 9 April 2007 deadline will be evaluated by a Government review panel, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  A typo was also corrected under H.2.1.

<DESC>Interested vendors—The solicitation HHM402-07-R-0030 (Integrated Systems Production & JRAAC Operations) is now posted on our website (http://www.msic.dia.mil/contracts/contract.html) .  Offers must be received in this office NLT 12:00 p.m. CST on 03 May 2007.  The Virginia Contracting Activity (VCA), on behalf of the Defense Intelligence Agency / Missile and Space Intelligence Center (DIA/MSIC), has a requirement for contractor support to accomplish diverse Scientific and Technical Intelligence (S&TI) missions associated with the Office for Integrated Intelligence (MSI) for an effort entitled "Integrated System Production & JRAAC Operations."  Contractor support shall address:  1) Intelligence Data, 2) C4 (Command, Control, Communications and Computer) System Analysis, 3) Integrated System Analysis Production, and 4) the Joint Research Assessment and Analysis Center (JRAAC) and Facility Operations.  The JRAAC is a digital computer laboratory that was developed to provide a simulation infrastructure that supports analysis of the capabilities, limitations, and vulnerabilities of threat systems in complex one-on-one and many-on-many scenarios.  Threat systems in MSIC?s mission area include surface-to-air-missiles (SAMs), short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), and directed energy weapon (DEW) systems.  The associated NAICS code for this effort is 541710.  Selection for award will be made to the offeror who meets the requirements and offers the best value to the Government based upon evaluations of proposals in the areas of technical capability, cost, management, and past performance.  This effort is a follow-on effort to contract number MDA908-03-D-0012 with Sparta, Inc. entitled "Integrated System Production and JRAAC Support."   Contract MDA908-03-D-0012 contains a clause that was synopsized in the solicitation leading up to contract award entitled "H.15 Performance Incentive" and this clause states:-----"At the end of the 3rd year of performance, the Government may initiate award of a new 5-year contract based on the contractor providing "above satisfactory performance."  This would be measured by zero contractor responsible delinquencies, continuous full staffing, and responsiveness to quick reaction tasks or situations.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency Region I, Boston Massachusetts, is seeking sources for the following equipment:

Zero Air System 
Basic Description: The Zero Air system filters/scrubs impurities from the air and 
supplies instrumentation with clean dry air, under pressure at a desired flow rate. Inlet air is pulled into the pump and routed through a pre-cooler and water trap which removes the water. The air then passes through a regenerative scrubber, where final drying occurs and then to an internal storage tank The system needs to have an internal oil-less diaphragm- less pump and provide an air flow of 30 Liters Per Minute (LPM). The scrubbers need to remove water (H2O), Sulfur Dioxide (S02), Ozone (03), Carbon Monoxide (CO), 
Oxides of Nitrogen (NO-N02), H2S and Hydrocarbons. Because size and weight are important, the system must have an internal pump, internal storage tank and rack 
mounting. The dimensions are not to exceed 8.57" X 17" X 23.5" and a maximum weight of 55 Ibs. 
Specifications: 
Flow: 30 LPM @ 3Opsig 
Dew point: -20 degrees up to 15LPM; -10 Degrees above 15 LPM 
Dryer: Regenerative heatless dryer with lifetime of greater than five years Output: S02 < 0.5 ppb NO < 0.5 ppb N02< 0.5 ppb 03 < 0.5 ppb 
CO < 0.25 ppm Hydrocarbons < 0.02 ppm 
Pump: Internal, oil less piston pump. Rack Mounted 
Dimension: 8.75" X 17" X 23.5" Weight: 551bs maximum Power: 115V 60 Hz 
Operating temp: 5 -40 degrees C Automatic Water Drain

<SUBJECT>18 -- Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) - SBIRS Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) Pre-Production Study
<SOLNBR>07-33
<RESPDATE>040407
<ARCHDATE>05042007
<CONTACT>Shanika  Richardson, Contracting Specialist, Phone 310-653-4502, Fax null, Email Shanika.Richardson@Losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) program office intends to issue a contract modification to SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract F04701-95-C-0017 for a pre-production study to assess design changes for the SBIRS Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) payloads.  It is anticipated that a request for proposal for the study will be released in April 2007 with a period of performance beginning in April and ending in 45 days after contract award.  The contract type will be cost-plus fixed fee.

The current SBIRS contractor is Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) in Sunnyvale, CA.  It is anticipated that this effort will be awarded to LMSSC on the current SBIRS EMD contract on a sole source basis.  (See numbered note 22).

The government intends to procure two additional HEO payloads at a later date.  The government's acquisition strategy for the two payloads is to build nearly identical replicas of the second production unit (HEO 2).  However, the government recognizes design changes will be required to accommodate parts and material obsolescence, a new Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) specification, corrections to HEO 2 waivers and deviations, and application of additional government specifications and standards.  

The objective of the study is to assess the programmatic impacts of potential design changes to give the government alternatives to develop an achievable and affordable requirements baseline for the new HEO production Request for Proposal.  The government intends to use the results of the study to refine the requirements based on the cost, schedule, and technical risks the contractor identifies.  A separate synopsis will be issued for the production effort.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command is seeking information from potential industry sources regarding either developmental or Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technologies that can provide improvements to Mobile Aircrew Restraint Systems for Crash & Fall protection.     Candidate platforms include both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft that include mobile crewmembers.     Systems are desired that have application to large cabin aircraft to provide continuous restraint while preventing mobile occupants from being ejected during a crash or from falling through large openings, doors, ramps, etc.     While COTS equipment is of particular interest, all candidate technologies that may meet Mobile Aircrew Restraint requirements are sought.     Technologies will be evaluated for their ability to provide both crash and fall protection for mobile crewmembers while still allowing crewmembers to perform all required mission tasks.     Retraction devices are sought that will sense and lock during both crash and fall events.     Technologies shall be inclusive of retractor and automatic locking systems.     Technology should be easily retrofitted into existing and future Naval and joint service aircraft.     The technology should also have quick installation procedures.   All candidate technologies should be suitable for use in military applications and associated environments, and should be compatible with all aircrew body-borne equipment configurations.     Companies submitting information can present a total system or components of the system.  Submission of information in response to this notice does not commit the Government to use the information in whole or in part for a subsequent procurement.  All inquires or submissions must be sent to  David Borne, Code AIR-2.4.3.3.5, Naval Air Systems Command, Building 2272, Room 353, 47123 Buse Road, Patuxent River, MD 20671-1547.

Department of the Air Force, Air Force Space Command, SCNG/PK – Space and Missiles System Center, Bldg. 270, 2nd Floor,  330 West Orbital Loop,  El Segundo, CA, 90245-4659


SCNC/PK intends to issue a delivery order for the procurement of a Transportable Tracking Station, for the Air Force Remote Block Change (RBC) Satellite Control Network.  The proposed action will be awarded to the existing contract, F04701-02-D-0006, Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC), which is a cost-plus-award fee, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for satellite and network control services and support.  The reason for this notice is because the original ordering period on the contract expired due to Government funding delays. 

This effort involves the fielding of the core electronics and antenna facilities for the Transportable system for the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN).  The AFSCN is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) primary network for supporting launch and early orbit operations.  The AFSCN provides telemetry, tracking, and commanding capability, mission data dissemination, processing, and is one of the nation’s primary high-powered networks for emergency recovery of space vehicles.

The AFSCN currently consists of legacy Automatic Remote Tracking Stations (ARTS) and is in the middle of a modernization to state-of-the-art tracking stations known as the Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC).  There are 5 RBC projects currently on contract.  This transportable will deploy primarily at fixed sites where legacy ARTS systems are being replaced by RBC antennas.  In addition, the transportable will be required to provide factory compatibility testing for satellite programs and emergency backup at existing RTSs.  The award of this delivery order is vital to ensuring uninterrupted operational capability to our AFSCN users.  Delays to the modernization effort will result in the loss of satellite contacts and a decrease in ability of our commanders to communicate with the battlefield.   This Transportable RBC will include, but not be limited to, the following deliverables:


1.	Project Management
2.	Project Systems Engineering
3.	Configuration Management
4.	Hardware Design & Development
5.	Software Design & Development
6.	Procurement
7.	Production
8.	System Integration, assembly, checkout, and shipping
9.	Test and Evaluation
10.	Data & Documentation
11.	Integration Logistics Support
12.	Environmental Engineering Compliance
13.	Site Acquisition, Installation,  and Acceptance

The value for these supplies and services is estimated at $20,000,000.

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine the extent of whether potential offerors exist who are capable of achieving the program objectives within acceptable cost, performance and schedule parameters.  Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. (HTSI) was awarded the Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC) in December 2001, and is presently on contract for delivery of all the earlier RBC articles.  Due to requirements and schedule changes, the ordering period for this transportable has elapsed.  The nature of this acquisition is unique due to the complex system integration.  HTSI has performed identical work on the previous RBCs and core sites. The Government anticipates a sole source award to the incumbent contractor, HTSI, but all responsible sources may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) that will be considered by the agency.  The Government does not anticipate any set-asides for this action. The current expected delivery order award date is the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.

<SOLNBR>W9124DNATGAS
<RESPDATE>040507
<ARCHDATE>06042007
<CONTACT>Steven Fries, 5026248043
<DESC>BACKGROUND:  In fiscal year (FY) 2005, Fort Knox used 869,000 mcf of natural gas at a cost of $6.9 million; in FY 2006, the total use was approximately 866,000 mcf at a cost of $9.9 million.   Fort Knox purchases its natural gas through a Defense Ene rgy Support Center (DESC) contract that pools customer requirements so as to leverage volume buying power.  The current marketer charge is approximately $.50 per mcf.  There is also a $.0487 transportation charge per mcf.  Additionally, the natural gas goe s through a pipeline owned by Louisville Gas and Electric (LG&E) of approximately 3.5 miles for which Fort Knox is charged an annual fee of $218,700.00.   Fort Knox uses much higher levels of natural gas during winter months than during summer months.  For t Knox obtains its electricity from Meade County RECC, Nolin RECC and Louisville Gas and Electric.  In FY 2005, Fort Knox used a total of 195 million KWHs at a cost of $7.7 million.  Similar usage and cost was experienced for FY 2006.  Natural gas from Dev onian shale is believed to be located throughout the Fort Knox military reservation.  Natural gas from Devonian shale is considered an alternative, non-conventional, and clean energy source.  Because of its continuing production, long-term well production life, and biogenic source, it is often also considered a renewable energy source.   PURPOSE:  The purpose of this RFI is to determine if there is credible interest in the development of a system to drill, extract, compress and transmit natural gas on the Fort Knox installation for use on the installation under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2394 which permits contracts for periods of up to 30 years for the provision and operation of energy production facilities on real property under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.  This RFI is not a solicitation or Request for Proposal/Quote.  Proposals/quotes or any other formal offers will not be accepted or considered by the Government in response to this RFI.  No contract will result from this RFI or any information submitted in response to it; however, the Government may use the lack of re sponse from the RFI in determining the availability of qualified and responsible entities to perform the requirements described herein.  Fort Knox seeks to contract with a qualified and responsible entity to drill an unspecified number of wells for natural  gas.  Each well location would be approved in advance by Fort Knox.  The contractor would also be required to construct a gas cleaning and compression facility that would receive the gas produced on Fort Knox, process it to the point of direct use, and fe ed it into Fort Knox gas lines.  Fort Knox is particularly interested in determining if entities would bear the cost of drilling, production, compression, and transmission and provide natural gas to Fort Knox at a discounted rate below what Fort Knox would  otherwise pay.   Extracted natural gas would first be used to meet the natural gas demand on Fort Knox.  Any excess natural gas would be provided for other DoD use or generation of electricity on Fort Knox.  The Government is seeking responses from intere sted parties as a result of this announcement.  The Government is soliciting interested parties only at this time.  No awards will be made from this announcement; however, all information received may be used for evaluation of future awards.  The Governmen t specifically reserves the right to meet its requirements through a Utilities Energy Savings Contracting (UESC) (also referred to as a Demand Side Management) project under 10 U.S.C. 2865 without further notice.      SUBMITTAL CONTENTS:  Interested entities shall provide a white paper (no more than 25 pages in length, single space, 10 or 12 font) describing their capabilities to meet the above described requirements.  The statement of interest shall include as a minimu m the following components:  (1) what experience, if any, you currently have in drilling, extracting, and de livering for end user consumption natural gas from Devonian Shale deposits; (2) financial capacity in excess of $10,000,000.00 you have to develop multiple well-heads, transportation piping, and gas compression facilities; (3) your proposed rate structure for providing natural gas extracting on the Fort Knox installation to Fort Knox and other DoD entities; (4) a statement as to willingness to assume all risk and costs associated with developing multiple well-heads, transportation systems, and gas compressi on facilities necessary to provide Fort Knox with 800,000 mcf of natural gas from Devonian Shale per year within five years of contract start; (5) information concerning experience with environmental issues and compliance regarding extraction of natural ga s from Devonian Shale deposits and (5) contact information, to include name, email address, phone number, and fax number.  Elaborate proposals or detailed pricing information is not required and should not be submitted.  The Government will not award a con tract based on this Request for Interest nor will participants be reimbursed for any costs associated with preparing and/or submitting responses. SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES:  Interested parties shall submit their statement of interest on company letterhead to:  Mr. Steven Fries, Army Contracting Agency  Southern Region, Fort Knox Directorate of Contracting, 199 6th Ave Ste 250, Fort Knox, KY  40121-5720 no later than April 5, 2007.

While the period of performance is up to six months, the Government estimates that a total of 800 hours of work will be utilized which, if 40 hours per week is worked, amounts to twenty weeks or 100 days of work. The Government will consider qualified respondents only if they meet all minimum requirements as articulated in the Statement of Work. Award will be made to the most qualified respondent, including the named proposed sole source awardee, based upon the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capabilities: i.e. understanding of the task requirements, education, experience. 2) Past Performance: experience in similar duties, references. 3) Price A "best value" determination will be made wherein when combined, technical capabilities and past performance are more important than price alone.

The contractor must be registered in Central Contractor Registration, have a DUNs number, and possess the appropriate security clearance as required under HSPD-12 (Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12). The Government will not delay or postpone award of contract pending an individual's CCR registration or HSPD-12 security clearances. Questions about this Notice must be directed to the Contracting Officer via e-mail only. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. The Contracting Officer's e-mail address is: marc_g_mackeigan@nbc.gov. The anticipated sole source award is made under the provisions of FAR 6.302-1. STATEMENT OF WORK Background: The Amended Compacts of Free Association between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, respectively (Public Law 108-188),  provided for annual assistance from the United States to these freely associated states over a 20 year period from fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2023.  As part of the financial assistance provided under the Compacts, two trust finds were set up to receive contributions, primarily from the United States, in the amounts of approximately $260 million for the Marshall Islands and $ 430 million in 2003 dollars for Micronesia, with the objective of investing its funds in order to build up a corpus which will be begin paying out funds to the two states in 2024 in lieu of further direct support from the United States.   These two trust funds are administered by two Trust Fund Committees, of which the Chairman is the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Insular Affairs of Department of the Interior.  The Committees are responsible for administration of the Trust Funds; most administrative duties are assigned to the Chairman.  The Trust Funds are authorized by the Trust Fund Agreement to contract with service providers and to pay administration expenses.  Each Trust Fund has hired a Trustee, an Investment Advisor and a Legal Counsel. However, neither has hired an administrative staff to manage the activities of the Trust Funds, including directing the investment of funds, managing activities of the Trust Fund Committees and coordinating the activities of the contractors. The Trust Fund Committees have not yet taken action to employ an Executive Administrator. Since the incorporation of the Trust Funds in 2004, their administrative functions have been performed by the Chairman (David Cohen) and the staff of the Office of Insular Affairs (OIA).  As the number and complexity of the administrative functions has increased, the management of the affairs of the Trust Funds requires the full time attention of one OIA staff member whose time has been diverted from other important activities of OIA.  As a result there is an urgent need to contract for the services of an Executive Administrator in the Office of Insular Affairs to administer the Trust Funds until they are prepared to employ an Executive Administrator on their own.   Objective: It is proposed to contract with an experienced and competent individual on approximately a full-time basis for a period of up to six months. Minimum Requirements: The contractor must have a minimum of a master's degree in economics, with a strong background in economic theory and finance, and at least 10 years of demonstrated experience in finances of insular areas and freely associated states.  The contractor must be skilled in writing financial reports and communicating with financial institutions.  The contractor must have worked with and be familiar with the Compacts of Free Association and subsidiary documents relating to the Trust Fund for the People of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Trust Fund for the People of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Security Clearance Requirements: The Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (Policy for a Common Identification  Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors) requires all contractors that have access to an IT system to have security clearance. This directive, signed by the President in  August 2004, requires all Federal departments and agencies to implement a mandatory,  Government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for all  Federal employees and contractors.   The primary goals of this initiative are to enhance  security, increase government efficiency, to reduce identity fraud and to protect personal  privacy.  The contractor will have to pay for any necessary background investigation. The Human Resources Office will provide the necessary forms to be completed by the  contractor depending on the security risk level of the position.  The contractor will be fingerprinted and must complete a verification of identity form.  Contractor Performance Dates and Reporting Contract performance will commence on date of the award, subject to Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) requirements.  The contract's period of performance is expected to take approximately six (6) months.  The Contractor will  report to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Insular Affairs in his capacities as (1) Chairman, Trust Fund Committee: Trust Fund for the People of the Federated States of Micronesia and (2) Chairman, Trust Fund Committee: Trust Fund for the People of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

<SUBJECT>--Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE) 07-1
<DESC>The U.S. Army Edgewood CB Center, Technology Evaluation Team in support of  the Joint Program Manager (JPM) for Biological Defense, is sponsoring Technology  Readiness Evaluation (TRE) 07-1: advanced biological agent identification technologies for the Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) Identifier Upgrade effort.  Vendors both domestic and international are encouraged to respond to this opportunity  with a description of hardware and data that demonstrates (1) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 or higher, (2) ability to automatically conduct a simultaneous analysis of 10 or more antigens in one milliliter or less liquid sample in JBPDS buffer (phosph ate buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton-X), (3) results reported within 18 minutes from time of sample introduction, (4) performance that has at least a 98% probability of identification for the minimum sensitivities of 5 x 105 CFU/mL (spore-forming bac teria), 5 x 107 PFU/mL (virus), and 30 ng/mL toxin, (5) less than 2% probability of false identification, (6) consumable operating cost less than $75 per 10 agent analysis, (7) size and weight or potential to be no greater than 16 H x 13 W x 10 D and 40  lbs., (8) temperature and power operation from 10o to 40oC on 24 VDC, not exceeding 40 WATTS, (9) potential or capability to identify additional antigens automatically (Expandability).   Plans are underway to conduct the point biological identification TRE in three phases.  Phase I is an assessment phase consisting of a review of the white paper responses followed by a determination of eligibility.  Select candidates will be invited to pro ceed to Phase II and participate in a laboratory evaluation for the following criteria: (1.) Probability of Identification and Probability of False Identification with and without Interferents, (2.) Range of Concentration, (3.)  Sample Process Time and Thr oughput, (4.)  Power, Size, and Weight of Hardware, (5.)  Simultaneous Antigen Identification, and (6.)  Maturity for JBPDS Integration.  Phase III, as described below, is a separate evaluation to test automated identification of samples in Formulated Tap Water only. Phase II operations will be conducted in the first quarter of FY 2008 (Oct to Dec 2007) on selected systems and will be operated by the vendor in a BSL-2 facility against liquid  inactivated antigens, interferents, and blank samples. A range of sample conc entrations will be prepared in JBPDS buffer.  It is estimated that a minimum of 40 not more than 80 liquid sample challenges per day will be prepared for test of each vendor system.  The estimated test time is three to four weeks for set-up, operational re adiness inspection (ORI) and completion of testing. The minimum number of total test samples is estimated at 400 samples.  The TRE site location is the Life Sciences Division Training Area, Dugway Proving Ground, Utah (Outside of Salt Lake City).  Test par ticipants invited to Phase II will be notified in May 2007.  Selected vendors will be invited to make a technical presentation of their system (Industry Days) in June of 2007.  Briefings will be submitted in a Portable Document Format (PDF), and 10 paper c opies of the briefing will be provided for the review panel.  The ECBC TRE 07-1 Team will coordinate the schedule of vendor presentations and location that is to be determined (TBD).   White paper format is Times New Roman, not less than 11 point as follow :  Technology Employed, System Nomenclature/Title, Detailed System Description, Cost, Biological Agent Capability List and Sensitivity, Interference Rejection Capability, Physical Properties, Power Requirements, Equipment Operating Procedures and Safety Pr ecautions, Auxiliary Support Equipment (if any), Performance Test Data including, Test Reports, and Logistics Requirements  10 pages maximum excluding test reports. Phase III is an evaluation of the technologies for automated identification of inactivated antigens in Formulated Tap Water.   This testi ng will be scored separately from the Phase II portion of the TRE,  and will commence after Phase II testing is completed.   Phase III operations will be conducted at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah by the vendor in a BSL- 2 facility against inactivated antige ns and blank samples, prepared in formulated tap water.  It is estimated that approximately 40 liquid sample challenges will be prepared for test of each vendor system. To be responsive to this announcement, vendors must supply their white paper response in writing to U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), 5183 Blackhawk Road ATTN: AMSRD-ECB-RT-DE (Daniel M. Nowak), Building E3326, Aberdeen Prov ing Ground, MD 21010, no later than close of business 30 April 2007.

3.2.2.	Provide Gain and Phase stability using a Nyquist Plot.
3.2.3.	Validation why the changes in 4.2.1 will potentially reduce EGT fluctuation.
3.2.3.1.	Provide the damping coefficient before and after change is implemented.
3.3.	Perform on-wing testing of the modified DTCA according to a test plan that the contractor will develop.  Test plan will need approval of 549thCBSS/GBEA. Test report will also be developed by the contractor reporting to 549thCBSS/GBEA the results of the on-wing testing. 
3.4.	Recommend a statement for inclusion into the present specification M50TF2617, which better defines the improvements that need to be made to the DTCA to reduce the EGT fluctuation.  Include placement for such statement.  If the specification does not support the improvements proposed by the contractor then the contractor will recommend an amending statement for the specification.
3.5	The government will provide the 12 ea. prototype DTCA’s to the contractor to be modified with the approved flux reducing design changes for testing.  These 12 DTCA’s will be shipped back to the government concurrent with the documentation and final report.

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY).

The Marine Corps distributed Backup Executive several years ago to all sites for the purpose of achieving data from systems such as servers. MARCENT is currently using Backup Exec as its archive solution. This purchase is an upgrade of the current version of the Backup Exec. This is the only means of upgrading this system. The only alternative to purchasing this upgrade would be to purchase an entirely new system, which is not economical. All software placed on Marine Corps networks must be on the approved software list which can be found on the Headquarters Marine Coprs Website. The version of Backup Exec listed in the purchase request is on the HQMC approved list. Since this is just an upgrade, it will save money by not having to remove our current systems and purchasing a new full version of archiving software. Furthermore, no new training would be required to re-learn the management of a new system. This particular product meets all standards and is in use throughout DOD. This product also enables MARCENT to meet Congressional Inquiries and FOIA requests in a timely and legal fashion. Other products would require extensive training to use and will make us incompatible with other units within the Marine Corps and DOD.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a sole source, firm-fixed price contract under commercial item acquisition procedures with Ninth House, Inc., One Beach Street, San Francisco, CA 94133 under RFQ 0193154.  This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov).  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  Ninth House is to provide follow-on, highly engaging and interactive web based courseware and simulations primarily based on text and video content from industry leading authors and lecturers in the areas of leadership and management.  Ninth House provides this material on a custom built learning management platform integrated with the FBI’s learning management system.  The integration is tailored to run stand-alone on the FBI’s intranet but provide usage information in the form of reports to Ninth House.

The requirement is a follow-on requirement for the continued development of a major system.  The FBI has determined award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays would be incurred.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit quotes to this office by 1:00PM, EST, Wednesday, March 29, 2007, via facsimile to the attention of Gary W.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-14.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334515 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses.  Only interested small businesses may submit a quote.

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a High Current, High Power DC Current Source to be used in the Atomics Physics Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:  

Line Item 0001:  The Contractor shall furnish one (1) Each, High Current, High Power DC Current Source

NIST requires a high current, high power DC current source to drive a resistive magnetic (the inductive load is about 2 mH) in an atom trapping experiment.  

The Contractor shall meet or exceed the following specifications:

1. Output current: minimum 400 A.
2. Output voltage: minimum 60 V.
3. Current setting 2 mA out of 400 A.
4. Long term stability: 2 mA.
5. Computer control via RS232 or GPIB.  Specifications 3, 4 and 5 are related.  Must be able to command a current from the computer to 5 ppm and expect that output.  Traditional analog inputs or 16 bit DACs are not sufficient.
6. Electronically quiet from DC to at least 20 MHz.
7. Timing: It is intended to drive current ramps which need to be programmed from an external computer and then synchronized with the remainder of the experiment.  Programmable ramps and synchronization with an external clock is required.  This can either mean that the device outputs a predefined current at whenever it receives an externally TTL signal (i.e., the user will program a list of currents, and the device would advance to the next current when each TTL trigger is received), or executes a ramp, but using an external reference clock as the time base (in this case, the ramp must begin upon the receipt of a single TTL trigger).
		
****The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, 3) Previous Experience, and 4) Price.  Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Previous Experience, when combined, are more important than Price.  Award shall be made on a best value basis.

***Greater consideration will be given to the Contractor whose quote exceeds specifications 1., 2., 3., and 4.  Under specification 5, GPIB is preferred and will be given greater consideration.
	
***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule. *** 

***The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ***

****Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quotations shall include the make and model of the products, manufacturer   sales literature or other product literature, which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered product(s) meet or exceed the specifications stated above.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received regarding this notice. 

Q1.  Are the quarterly publications limited to NIHMedlinePlus and NEWSLINE?  Or are there other publications included? 

        A1.  Yes.

Q2.  Are we to produce the podcast or simply prepare the editorial content for the podcast? 

	A2.  Just prepare the editorial content for the podcast.

Q3.  Are the contract writers to be a part of our team, or are they writers you already have under contract? 

	A3.  They are to be part of your team.

Q4.  What is the definition of production of NLM promotional materials?  Does this mean writing, design, printing, web coding, etc or just writing and editing? 

	A4.  Production of NLM promotional materials means writing and editing.

Q5.  In light of the fact that price is one of the factors considered in the evaluation of our proposal, what type of cost information is desired?  For example, do you want information of hourly rates, or rates by task? Do you want a separate cost proposal?  There does not appear to a point value for price/cost, yet it is an evaluation factor.  Please explain.  

	A5.  By hours per task.

Q6.  What is the estimated level of effort 

	A6.  Approximately two FTEs.
Q7.  Does a contractor currently perform the work specified in the solicitation? If so, who is the contractor and how long have they been providing this support to NLM? 
A7.  We have had contract support for about one year.  For information on the Contractor please submit a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. 
Q8.  The second paragraph under the "Description" heading indicates that some of the work will be performed at NIH. Could you please indicate what level of effort (in FTEs) will need to be performed at NIH and the type of work (e.g., meetings with NLM staff, writing, design, web support, etc.)? How many FTEs per type of work? 
A8.  Two FTEs will be required.  Other than meetings, the remainder of the work can be performed off NIH campus.
Q9.  Task 1 states that the contractor shall "prepare and edit articles." What is meant by prepare? Does this task involve writing? Research? Photography? Design and layout? 
	A9.  Prepare under Task 1 means to research, write, and edit.
Q10.  How many articles for the NLM quarterly publications will be prepared and edited by the contractor? 
A10.  It would vary.  It is estimated that approximately 40-50 articles of varying lengths will be prepared and edited by the contractor for the NLM quarterly publications.

	A13.  Approximately four two-day conferences per year.
Q14.  Task 4 indicates that the contractor is to "coordinate” the development, drafting . . . and fact checking of conference proceedings but does not say that the contractor will actually perform the tasks. Does this mean that the contractor actually covers the meetings, draft the proceedings, and so on?  If not, could you please describe the tasks involved in coordination, and how many different contributors would be involved? 
	A14.  The contractor would be expected to attend the conference and draft the 	proceedings, preparing an analysis of the conference proceedings for use as a 	written record of the proceedings as well as a news piece in a quarterly 	publication.

	A17.  Other outreach materials mentioned under Task 5 may include public 	services announcements, business reply cards, storyboards, or other materials 	designed to promote the quarterly publications of the NLM.
Q18.  Are the NLM promotional materials mentioned under Task 8 different from the outreach materials mentioned in Task 5? If so, what will Task 8 materials be, how many will be developed annually, and, in addition to writing, what will the contractor be required to do under this task? 
A18.  The Promotional materials mentioned under Task 8 refer to  brochures, reports, press releases, announcements, and other written materials designed to promote programs of the NLM.
Q19.  Regarding the requirements relative to weekly podcasts, will the contractor go beyond preparation of the script to also produce the podcast for distribution? 

A19.  No.  The contractor would only be responsible for preparing the script for the podcast.

Q20.  Your amendment to the solicitation seems to indicate a need for at least 2 FTEs or a combination of several part-time FTEs.  How many FTEs do you anticipate needing for this task?

A20.  It is anticipated that approximately two FTEs will be required to fulfill this task.

Q21.  Evaluation Factor B.  Personal Merit.  You have asked for “A resume...”   Do you truly want only one resume for the lead position who demonstrates the required qualifications?

A21.  Yes.

Q22.  4. How much travel to the NIH offices is expected? How many days at a time?

Q25.  How long is it anticipated that the twice weekly conference calls will last? What is their duration? An hour each time? More? 

A25.	An hour each time.

Q26.  How many layers and people are involved in the approval process? What is the turn around time for review and approval? 

A26.  Approval process is variable depending on approving Institute staff schedule – usually several days following submission.

Q27.  Under 'Personal Merit' it states qualifications must be demonstrated. What qualifications are required of the contractor other than being a small business? 

A27.  NLM would like to review the contractor’s previous experiences in handling contracts of a similar nature.

Q28.  How many other contractors are involved in the production of the publications? 

A28.  Three.

Q29.  What is the timeline for awarding the contract?

A30.  There are no insurance requirements for the contractor.

Q31.  Can you explain what the 'conference proceedings' are in the 4th task description? 

A31.  The conference proceedings includes the compilation of all remarks delivered as well as any audiovisuals and handouts presented to supplement remarks.

Q32.  The amendment says: "3)  Research, draft, revise, and prepare podcasts for use by the NLM Director in his weekly podcast (4 hours per podcast/1 per month);"  Please clarify what you mean by "1 per month". If the podcast is held weekly, there will be 4 podcasts per month.

A32.	That was an error.  It should read, “4 hours per podcast/1 per week.”

Q33.  Is there a particular format in which you would prefer that we tailor our proposal regarding Solicitation Number 07-079SB? Some organizations provide a list of specific headings under which the details of a contract proposal may be presented. 

A33.	There is not a particular format that we prefer for the submission of your proposal.  

Q34.  Are you going to issue a series of task orders or is this a professional services contract?  We are unclear as to what the form of the contract is. 
A34.  Professional Services
Q35.  What kind of contract will be awarded (e.g., cost plus fixed fee, time and materials, etc.)?

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
Inverted Domestic Corporation.  A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held. 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a U.S. Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

PARTICIPANTS:  Twenty-five – thirty participants in each of the two sessions will be novice through intermediate knowledge level users of the specific equipment listed below.  The participants capture images of biological specimens in daily tasks, many of which are extremely time sensitive.  They are also tasked with producing image-based informational materials such as reports, fact sheets, and slide presentations.  LEARNING OBJECTIVES:  USDA-APHIS-PPQ Identifiers who participate in this workshop should gain increased fluency in capturing, measuring and enhancing images using the Nikon DS-fi1 camera and L-2 Control Unit.  They should become comfortable with camera setting terminology, performing common tasks with the camera and control unit, such as calibrating and placing scales, adjusting camera exposure and gain, and using the histograms to obtain predictable images and preserve data in their images.  Microscope techniques will not be the primary subject of this workshop, and will be addressed tangentially, if at all.  Identifiers should also leave the workshop with increased fluency in:  (a) applying general photographic principles to image capture with point and shoot handheld cameras (i.e., Nikon 4800, Canon A640); (b) performing common editing and optimization tasks in Adobe Photoshop Elements; (c) preparing and placing images in presentation programs such as Microsoft Word and Power Point; (d) using Adobe Acrobat effectively to finish, compress and secure documents.  At the end of the three-day workshop, each identifier will complete a fact sheet or slide presentation.  The goal of this workshop is to provide intensive hands-on practice in the use of  the Digital Sight camera and processes that occur after image capture. 
EQUIPMENT:  Contractor must be thoroughly familiar with and have experience training novice and intermediate professional adults in use of the equipment list below.  Contractor should be aware of the USDA-APHIS-PPQ mission and have an appreciation for the diversity of subjects APHIS identifiers must photograph.
