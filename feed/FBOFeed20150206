This requires system level assessment, sustainment evaluation, and problem resolution expertise beyond what is available in the A-10 System Program Office (SPO). Using commands (such as Air Combat Command, Air Force Reserve Command, and Air National Guard) depend on A-10 engineering to analyze any system deficiency, develop repair procedures, and recommend alternative solutions for operational and maintenance related support issues regarding aircraft systems, products, and materials in a timely manner. This effort includes evaluating and testing of aircraft systems to determine if problems exist that are due to aging, obsolescence, sustainment, bad maintenance practices, or component failure issues.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong></p>
<p>This effort is to acquire field level technical and engineering support services for the A-10 SPO. The Contractor shall be required to assess and resolve various engineering requests for technical assistance in order to sustain the A-10 aircraft system, support equipment and related data. This will require the contractor to have the appropriate skills, experience, capabilities, and knowledge in order to provide the necessary support.</p>
<p>Specific tasks include maintenance engineering and technical support, engineering support for AFMC Forms 107 and 202, analyses and support for avionics and mechanical sub-system commodity/component failures, providing recommended solutions for technical data deficiencies, engineering support for Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) 22/252, technical meeting support, design reviews, and mishap/safety investigations.</p>

<DESC>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Air Dominance Division, AIM 120 Development Branch (AFLCMC/EBAD) intends to solicit and award a sole source Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Raytheon Missile Systems, 1151 E. Hermans Road, Tucson AZ, 85756 in support of AIM-120 weapon system improvement activities. The purpose of this anticipated action is to establish a contractual vehicle to facilitate candidate study/analysis and technical maturation/risk reduction efforts for the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) AIM-120D. Delivery orders issued under this IDIQ contract will include, but not be limited to, studies to identify and analyze, potential system improvement candidates and provide the Government with recommendations on the viability of integrating the improved capabilities into the AMRAAM AIM-120D configurations. Separate contract actions, not covered by this notice, will be negotiated and awarded to implement selected matured candidates recommended by the study as well as any other improvements envisioned for the AIM-120D. Also under the scope of this contract, candidate capabilities will be matured to a preliminary design review level of development, yielding a "prototype" software code for the missile variants. Additionally, this anticipated contract action will enable the prospective contractor to make laboratory digital Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) improvements and maintain Government furnished laboratory test station and development and test equipment. Maintenance of Government property is expected to be over and above the normal or routine maintenance that may be required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation Government Property clause. Finally, delivery order requirements under this IDIQ contract will include deliveries of reports that capture the results of performance capability assessments and studies to include evaluations of candidate impacts on weapon system performance. The only known responsible source that can satisfy this requirement is Raytheon Missile Systems because it possesses the required, specific, and detailed knowledge that could only be gained by years of experience in applying skills to the specific AMRAAM missile design. Raytheon Missile Systems has extensive experience with AMRAAM software, produces the AMRAAM missile in all configurations, and operates the only known AMRAAM special test assets and U.S. Government simulation facilities. This&nbsp;IDIQ contract is anticipated to have an ordering period from 1 September 2015 through 30 September 2019 with a contract Period of Performance not to exceed 30 September 2022. The contract ceiling, or maximum ordering amount, will be $100M.&nbsp; In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Any submission will need to demonstrate how the source can provide qualified capabilities without incurring substantial duplication of costs or unacceptable delays to the AMRAAM program activities. Responses must be received within 15 calendar days after the posted date of this synopsis.<br /><br />An ombudsman has been appointed in accordance with AFFARS 5352.201-9101. Before consulting with the ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer for resolution. If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, the interested party may contact the Ombudsman (Interim), Ms. Jill Willingham, Acquisition Program Management Division, (AFLCMC/AQP), Wright Patterson, AFB, OH, 937-255-5472.
<p>Communications regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Steve Wall, (850) 883-0796.</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

<DESC> <br> Closing Date:  February 20, 2015 <br>  <br> This acquisition requires the Fixed Wing Project Office (FWPO) to acquire hardware and services to modify two Hellenic Army King Air KA B200 aircraft with Universal Avionics UNS-1Ew Flight Management System (FMS).   This modification/upgrade is required to ensure that the two Hellenic Army aircraft have the navigational capabilities to safely navigate in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) airspace In Accordance With (IAW) Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.   This is a unique one time action resulting in a new contract that will be accomplished on two existing Hellenic Army aircrafts.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(II),  quote mark only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements quote mark .  This item is restricted to Stevens Aviation Incorporated (SAI), (CAGE 003X4); NAICS Code 336411, because the Government does not possess the necessary drawings and technical data to provide to industry to allow them to perform this effort.  Thus, SAI already possesses the necessary technical data rights to provide support required accomplishing this effort.  SAI is the only company to possess a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) which was issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The STC is critical to the installation of the FMS.  SAI is the only company that can complete the effort within a reasonable time and cost.  This delay would not meet the requirements stated in the letter of request (LOR) from the Hellenic Republic.  Using a source other than SAI would significantly increase the cost for this effort and negatively impact schedule.     Required delivery:  period of performance (PoP) 4 weeks after contract award.  All Offerors must meet prequalification requirements in order to be elgible for award.  Firms that recognize and can produce the required item described above are encouraged to identify themselves.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  The closing date annotated is an estimated date and may be adjusted dependent upon the date of released solicitation; however, the solicitation will not close prior to the date stated above.  Foreign firms are reminded that all requests for solicitation must be processed through their respective embassies.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>National Library Services for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH) requires contractor-provided services for Multistate centers (MSCs) to function as materials-support units for NLS for network libraries in two specified geographical areas of the country.  Working under the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH) on a contractual basis and relating directly to the network libraries in their service areas, the centers provide publications, equipment, supplies, and interlibrary loan service for all NLS/BPH mass-produced books and audio books that appear on the Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD) but which NLS has not made physical copies available, braille magazines on request to network agencies and to the other MSC.  They must receive, store, shelve, duplicate, manage, and distribute all NLS/BPH-issued books, selected special collections including assigned back issues of braille magazines and volunteer-produced material (including cassette, digital, and braille books selected for limited distribution); store and manage duplicating masters such as open reel tape, and cassette, and have access to BARD to download books for which a patron or library needs a physical copy; store and ship sound reproducers and allied equipment; and store and ship publications and supplies. The administrative functions of the centers include managing staff use of online and local and electronic information fulfillment systems, customer service, electronic inventory, information systems, purchasing, quality control, and safety.  Many of the Centers support services require use and management of Web-based NLS applications.
<p>The successful bidder for regional 1 would serve all of NLS's network of cooperating libraries (and eligible patrons) located east of the Mississippi River. The successful bidder for region 2 would service all NLS network libraries (and eligible patrons) located west of the Mississippi River.</p>

<DESC>Item Description: NSN 2530-01-333-6068- Caliper Assembly, Disc Brake, bought in accordance with AM General (34623) part number 12342341. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. The required quantity is 5731 AY with a 50% option quantity of 2866 AY shipping to (W25G1U) DLA Distribution DDSP New Cumberland Facility, New Cumberland, PA 17070-5002. This solicitation is being issued under the First Destination Transportation (FDT) program. FOB origin and inspection at origin are required. This solicitation will be available on the internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 02/23/15. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance, socioeconomic and Ability One. The required delivery is 300 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. All interested parties may submit an offer.<br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposal shall not be transmitted directly to the contracting officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at: ContractorProposalDLALandandMaritime@dla.mil.

The subject QSL will be the basis of a separate Standardization Action (SA) resulting in an Incentive Agreement (IA). This initiative will be part of the MSPV program which is executed by the DLA Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel.</p>
<p>To participate in the QSL process vendors must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Medical/Surgical PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. Vendors who previously had an active record in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM). For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support's MSPV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p><strong>All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support MSPV program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification.</strong> Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Maryann DiMeo at DLA Troop Support, maryann.dimeo@dla.mil, 215-737-3201. Detailed information about the QSL requirements will be provided in the QSL FBO Announcement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the QSL FBO is imminent. Upon issuance of the QSL FBO, all relevant information will be available electronically on the FBO website.</p>

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Jennifer Pacheco Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-4586 Email: jennifer.l.pacheco19.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 333111 with the related size standard of 500 employees (or dollars). The Offeror shall be actively registered with that NAICS or a similar NAICS with the appropriate size standard prior to Award to be considered for any resulting contract. Failure to be properly registered under the appropriate size standard during evaluation and/or at the time of award deems the offer ineligible for award. A similar NAICS Code with the appropriate size standard other than the NAICS Code identified in this buy term may be used as a factor to determine technical capability. (Size standards do not apply to unrestricted set-aside solicitation/RFQ). <BR> <BR>The Government will award a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price, Delivery, Technical Capability, Past Performance of the item offered to meet the Government requirement. All evaluation factors other than Price, when combined, are about equally as important as price. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for continuation of engineering technicians and trade skills support services under the current Marshall Engineering Technicians and Trades Support (METTS) Services Contract until such time that the competition for the follow-on METTS contract is completed and the follow-on contract begins. Proposals for the follow-on contract have been received and the competition is nearing the final stages of the proposal evaluation process. <P> NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the continuation of services through a 3-months extension to the current METTS contract with Info Pro Corporation (IPC). This will allow for continuation and stability of these services through the completion of the competition process for the follow-on METTS contract. <P> NASA/MSFC has design responsibility for the Space Launch System (SLS) and receives considerable engineering technician and trades support from IPC under the METTS contract. Currently, there are close to seven (7) major tests in build-up in support of the SLS Program. In addition, some major manufacturing activities are ongoing using the 7-axis machining center in the fabrication of the Shell Buckling Seamless Barrels. <P> As the current METTS contractor, IPC is uniquely positioned to continue providing the engineering technician and related services in support of Space Launch System (SLS) during this time of design, fabrication and testing. IPC has been the support contractor providing engineering technician and related skills to MSFC since initiation of the SLS Program. Use of IPCs existing and proven capabilities during this 3-months extension period will permit the timely execution of significant tasks that are necessary for achieving SLS milestones. <P> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <P> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on February 23, 2015. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <P> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <P> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <P> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for crew transportation services to and from the International Space Station (ISS). These services include launch, return, and rescue of U.S. or U.S.-designated astronauts and associated services, which include but are not limited to the following requirements for primary and ancillary services: <P> Training and training materials for the safe operation of the vehicle including necessary unique equipment and supplies  Astronaut and NASA designated support personnel access to the launch site with services to include launch operations and ascent control   Flight control operations, rendezvous and on-orbit docking services  On-orbit consumables, life support systems, and habitability services necessary during operations independent of the ISS  Search and rescue services, recovery at landing site, medical operations, NASA designated personnel access to the landing site and return transportation of the crew to the NASA delegation  On-orbit rescue services for the duration of the increment   Rehabilitation post-flight, medical exams and services (on a contingency basis)  Associated crew cargo upmass commensurate with seat(s) purchased  Associated crew cargo returned commensurate with seat(s) purchased <P> NASA/JSC intends to contract with Roscosmos for these services on a sole source basis for six (6) Soyuz seats and associated services for calendar year (CY) 2018 with rescue/return services extending through spring 2019. NASA needs to secure crew transportation with a known reliable provider to ensure a continued U.S. presence aboard the ISS until the sustained availability of a U.S. commercial vehicle.	The intent of this proposed action is to provide the Government the ability to procure these uninterrupted services until a U.S. provider demonstrates full operational capability.	 <P> NASA has established a goal to ensure there are U.S. domestic space transportation vehicle(s) capable of traveling to low Earth orbit and has awarded contracts with two U.S. commercial entities for future U.S. commercial space flights.  Commercial crew vehicle development is in the early stages and the first U.S. commercial crewed flight test is currently projected to occur in late CY 2017.  Given the current maturity level of the commercial vehicles and the 3-year procurement lead time for Soyuz crew transportation services, NASA must contract for Soyuz now in order to assure uninterrupted access to ISS in CY 2018.  <P> Until the U.S. commercial vehicles are successfully demonstrated and meet the acceptance criteria established by NASA, continued access to Russian crew launch, return, and rescue services is essential for planned ISS operations and utilization by all ISS partners. <P> However, once it is determined that US Commercial entities are able to fulfill increment crew transportation requirements, the US Commercial vehicles will become NASAs primary transportation source to ISS.  The Soyuz vehicles procured under this action may then be utilized as a backup transportation option to ensure proper launch cadence or to augment future ISS operations and research. <P> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <P> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 20, 2015. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to re-compete a requirement currently being performed under NIA Contract HHSN271201000006I. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under FAR Part 15. It is anticipated that a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract will be awarded on or about August 1, 2015 with a 10-year period of performance. It is expected that a solicitation will be issued on or about September 30, 2014.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:</span></strong></p>
<p>Current and projected experiments using rodents to model the aging processes and age-related diseases in humans require animals of defined genotype and controlled environmental and health status. Only with the meticulous, long-term control of genetic and environmental variables is it possible to maintain relevant animal models that may be used to study many of the biological and behavioral processes in aging. Therefore, a continuous supply of genetically defined, well characterized inbred and hybrid laboratory animals is essential for a program of research on aging. In 2010, NIA awarded a 9-year contract for the development and maintenance of a colony of genetically defined aged mice. This RFP contemplates award of a follow-on contract.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:</span></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined laboratory mice for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT REQUIRMENTS:</span></strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged mice of NIA-specified genotypes for use by investigators in studies of aging. The expected duration of this colony, and therefore of this contract, is ten years. During years 1 through 2, animals shall be entered into the colony, but few animals shall be removed from the colony except for the purposes of monitoring health and genetic purity. However, if the need should arise, animals may be distributed from the colony at any time at the direction of the Contractor Officer's Representative (COR). During years 3 through 7, animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators. This should be a period of stable operation with young animals entering the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final period, years 8-10, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 8 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population in this contract colony will decline to a point of zero or very few animals at the end of year ten.</p>
<p>The colony population at the end of each year of the nine year period should be approximately as follows:</p>
<p>YEAR 1 10,000 YEAR 4 72,000 YEAR 7 72,000 YEAR 10 Near Zero<br />YEAR 2 50,000 YEAR 5 72,000 YEAR 8 50,000 <br />YEAR 3 72,000 YEAR 6 72,000 YEAR 9 20,000</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire foundation stock for four inbred strains of mice from a stock center identified by the COR and shall re-derive the stock by caesarian section or embryo transfer under barrier conditions. After re-derivation, testing to confirm genetic purity and SPF health status shall be performed on the foundation colony, and breeding colonies will be established for the four inbred strains and two derivative hybrid strains. Mice will be entered into the aging colony at levels defined in the contract Statement of Work (SOW), currently a total of 4,150 mice per month (the hybrid strains account for approximately 5% of the total entry levels).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all production space needed for the colony, including at least two independent barriers to house the colony, with independent back-up and alarm systems. Since this is an aging colony, the contractor must be prepared to house the animals for up to 2-3 years each. Mice shall be provided with sterilized food (formulation consistent with NIH31 open formula) and bedding, and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity range, light cycle, water treatment, etc.) as defined in the SOW. Mice shall be monitored weekly for signs of fighting or morbidity.</p>
<p>Semi-annual genetic monitoring of the breeding colonies and quarterly health monitoring of the aging colonies shall be performed and reported to the COR as well as be included in the semi-annual progress reports. Genetic monitoring shall be accomplished by a panel of microsatellite markers that distinguish the inbred strains. Health monitoring shall include external exams for parasites, microbiology, serology, and histology.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ship the mice to investigators upon authorization from the COR or her representative, providing secure shipping crates, food and water sources, climate-controlled transport and provide a weekly inventory of the aging colony in a format approved by the COR. .</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REPORTS/DELIVERABLES:</span></strong></p>
<p>The following reports will be required: (1) Post-re-derivation Health and Genetic Monitoring Report; (2) Breeding Colony Development Report; (3) Semi-Annual Progress Reports; (4) Weekly Inventory Report; (5) Health Monitoring Reports; (6) Genetic Monitoring Reports; Caloric Restricted Set-Aside Body Weight Reports; (7) Individual Postmortem Reports; and (8) Final Report.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:</span></strong></p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 112990 with a size standard of $0.75 million.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-14-003 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-14-003.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

In order to access/view/download the Request for Proposal, drawings and specification from Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) each company is required to have a MPIN as described below.

The Marketing Partner ID Number (MPIN) is mandatory for SAM registrants and contains nine characters. An MPIN is a personal code (password) that allows you to access government applications such as the FedBizOpps and Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). 

To view your companys MPIN:

1.	Go to the SAM Homepage: www.sam.gov.
2.	Enter your user ID and password, then click the Log In button.
3.	Locate your entity via the Complete Registrations or Incomplete Registrations link under Manage Entity in the left navigation pane.
4.	Go to the Business Information page to view and change your MPIN.

Getting Your MPIN

1.	Look up your DUNS at the following URL: www.sam.gov
2.	Check the status of your company profile.
 It must be active in the System for Award Management (SAM) for the user to be able to register it in FedBizOpps.
3.	If there is a problem with the profile, such as expired account or a missing mandatory data element, please contact the Entity Registration Representative for your company.
4.	If it is a new SAM registration (within 24 hours), please try again in 24-48 hours (excluding the weekend). That is how long it takes SAM to process the information and send the update to FBO.gov for processing.
5.	If your SAM registration is active, and it has been more than 48 hours (excluding the weekend) since it was created, it is generally an issue where the incorrect DUNS/MPIN combination is being used.
 Please confirm the DUNS/MPIN information with your Entity Registration Representative again to ensure the correct MPIN is being used. Be careful not to confuse the TIN with the MPIN. For large companies with multiple DUNS, pay close attention to which MPIN is assigned to which DUNS.
6.	If all of the above items are validated and you are still having an issue, please contact the Federal Service Desk for further assistance. 

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  All contractors submitting bids, proposals or quotes on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award of the contract.  The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information capabilities and financial information to the Government.
  The SAM website can be accessed at www.sam.gov.  Reference is made to FAR Clause 52.204-7, System for Award Management.  Prospective Offerors are encouraged to register as soon as possible.  All new contracts can ONLY be made to contractors who are registered in SAM.  This requirement will apply to all solicitations and award, regardless of the media used.

This effort includes the development and maintenance of the LT2 framework and architecture, along with the development and support of the individual products of the LT2 P/L.  The goal of this requirement is to ensure and support the compatibility, commonality, and interoperability with current and future LT2 P/L assets and systems, and to maintain this compatibility throughout the acquisition life-cycle.   <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:   The Government intends to award a Single Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Firm Fixed Price (FFP), and Time and Material (T&M) Line Items.

Delivery Orders 0001 and 0002 are anticipated to be CPFF and Delivery Order 0003 is anticipated to be a combination of CPFF and FFP.  Award will be made under full and open competition on a best value basis utilizing trade-off procedures.  The ordering period for this effort is expected to be five years with an estimated ordering ceiling of $415M.  The tentative timeframe for RFP release is third quarter FY14 with award anticipated to be made in third quarter FY15.

Services will include, but not be limited to, provision of an alcohol and drug free environment, facilitation of active affiliation with Alcoholics Anonymous/Narcotics Anonymous programs, supportive social activities, and individual counseling as required to facilitate overcoming resistance to engagement in DVA treatment or rehabilitative services. It is further understood that beneficiaries receiving services under this contract will be provided access to basic health and hygiene maintenance opportunities, monitoring of medication compliance, appliances and materials for laundry needs and any other service or supplies without additional charge. Two hot meals and a sack lunch will be provided daily Monday through Friday for patients enrolled in Ambulatory Detoxification and Outpatient Rehabilitation.

<p>AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman (Apr 2010) - As prescribed in AFFARS 5301.9103, insert the clause in all solicitations (including draft solicitations) and contracts. NOTE: This clause is consistent with customary commercial practice in that it provides a point of contact to foster communication between buyers and sellers. The primary function of the ombudsman is to hear concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, to communicate these concerns to senior management personnel responsible for oversight and to assist in the resolution of the concerns. Similar functions are performed by a commercial entity's customer service representative(s) or activity. Inclusion of this clause provides a benefit to commercial entities and does not levy upon them any requirement that is inconsistent with commercial practice.</p>

<p>FAR 52.252-2, Clauses Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998) - As prescribed in FAR 52.107(b), this clause is included in the solicitation and resulting contract as required to incorporate clauses by reference that are authorized to be incorporated by reference and that are required to implement provisions of law or executive orders applicable to acquisition of commercial items.</p>
<p>DFARS 252.209-7993-Class Deviation-Prohibition Against Contracting With Corporations That Have an Unpaid Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under Federal Law- In accordance with DoD Class Deviation 2012-O0009 insert the provision in all solicitations that will result in a contract action that will use funds made available by Division A of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (Pub. L. 112-74)</p>
<p>DFARS 252.225-7002, Qualifying Country Sources as Subcontractors (Apr 2003) - As prescribed in DFARS 225.1101(3), this clause is used when the clause at DFARS 225.7001 is included. DFARS 225.7001 is included to implement 41 U.S.C. 10a - 10d, EO 10582, as checked in the clause at DFARS 252.212-7001.</p>

<p>Attention: Small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort:</p>
<p>No set aside decision has been made; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of providing at least 50% of the entire scope of the multifunctional waveform generators, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996) ... (b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern... ". Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.</p>
<p>If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Attention: All potential respondents:</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy for this program has not been finalized. If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on the requirement and what areas are likely candidates for SB subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II. Capabilities Survey Questions:</p>
<p>1. Name of Country where the item is manufactured.<br />2. Describe briefly the capabilities of your facility and the nature of the services you provide. Include a description of your staff composition and management structure.<br />3. Describe your company's past experience on previous projects similar in complexity to this requirement. Include contract numbers, a brief description of the work performed, period of performance, agency/organization supported, and individual point of contact (Contracting Officer or Program Manager).<br />4. Describe your company's capabilities for generating, handling, processing and storing classified material and data.<br />5. Describe your company's capabilities for generating, handling, processing and storing technical reports.<br />6. Describe your company's capabilities and experience in providing statistical, technical test &amp; evaluation support to identified acquisition programs. Identify what software programs are utilized to generate these data products and what formats are available for delivered items.<br />7. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that we provide that would currently preclude your product/service from being a viable solution to our requirement?</p>
<p>8. Describe your capabilities and experience in managing website content projects and development of tracking databases, including subcontractor involvement. Include any experience in project planning, work breakdown structures, resource allocations, schedule tracking, risk analysis and cost management.<br />9. Are there established market prices for our requirement? If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public? Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions? Briefly describe any differences.<br />10. Describe your standard warranty and return process for goods and services furnished to the government for items similar in nature to this requirement.</p>
<p>If your company is interested, e-mail your responses to: robin.smith.4@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>E-mail responses should be received no later than 10:00 a.m. EST on February 20th, 2015. Direct and succinct responses are preferred. Marketing materials are considered an insufficient response.</p>
<p>All responses must be UNCLASSIFIED; no classified material will be accepted or considered with this Sources Sought Synopsis. The response to Part I, "Business Information", should be single spaced, 12pt font. The response to Part II, "Capabilities", should be limited to no more than 20 pages (8.5x11 inches), single spaced, 12pt font. In addition, identify a representative to support further Government inquiries and requests for clarification of the information provided, if needed. Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly. The Air Force will handle proprietary items in accordance with FAR 2.101 and 3.104.</p>
<p>Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on this FedBizOpps website, unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a company or that company's response. Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after the sources sought assessments are complete. An Industry Day (date to be determined) with one-on-one information sessions with respondents may be offered to clarify the Government's understanding of their submittal, capability ramifications, or to discuss their business approach.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Belvoir Division (ACC-APG Belvoir) on behalf of the US Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) is conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. Responders to this Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) are asked to provide their technical capability information (aka Statement of Capabilities) required to perform the requirements provided below.  Statements should address the specific requirements of this notice and identify the vendors' specific capability to complete these requirements, including, but not limited to a description of corporate experience with similar projects and information on applicable industry certifications at the individual and organizational level as well as describing investments in quality/process improvement activities.  <br>  <br> The NVESD Countermine Division, Dismounted Soldier Application Branch is seeking experienced, qualified sources to design handheld multi-sensor explosive-hazard detection systems.  The objective is to mature advanced sensor designs and investigate methods to integrate sensor and display components into a lightweight and low cost handheld system that will provide a high probability of detection against the wide range of buried explosive hazard threats.  Buried explosive hazards can include landmine threats; deeply buried metallic and non-metallic improvised explosive device (IED) main charges; and triggering mechanisms to include non-metallic conductive components and wires.  Design solutions that have a low training burden, are easy to use, can improve the discrimination of targets from clutter, and have improved rates of advance over current multi-sensor handheld detectors are of interest. The Government is seeking sources having previous success in developing multi-sensor handheld explosive hazard detection systems with the capability to discriminate targets from clutter objects.  Sources should describe past experience in designing and developing multi-sensor handheld detectors and current capabilities to design and validate integrated multi-sensor solutions. <br>  <br>  <br> The Government seeks sources with key competencies to comprehensively meet the following requirements: <br>  <br> 1. Investigate new ground penetrating radar (GPR) antenna designs that allow increased GPR detection footprint, deeper detection and better signal-to-noise ratios to detect buried explosive hazard threats.  Buried explosive hazards can include landmine threats; deeply buried metallic and non-metallic IED main charges; and triggering mechanisms to include non-metallic conductive components and wires. Output raw and processed GPR data to feed automated detection algorithms and displays for user visualization.  Mature GPR sensor components to a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4 within 12 months and to TRL 5 within 24 months from the start of the effort.   <br>      <br> 2. Investigate electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor designs capable of detecting the full range of metallic and low-metallic buried explosive hazards components listed above.  Research methods to discriminate targets of interest from other small metallic surface-laid or shallow-buried clutter in real time.  Investigate methods to reduce interference from external EMI sources and decrease minimum separation distance required while operating multiple detectors in close proximity.  Output raw and processed EMI data to feed automated detection algorithms and displays for user visualization.  Mature EMI sensor components to a minimum of TRL 4 within 12 months and to TRL 5 within 24 months from the start of the effort.               <br>  <br> 3. Explore methods for detecting wires.  Investigate data outputs from both GPR and EMI sensors to improve the probability of detecting wires.  Explore alternative sensors that can increase probability of detection of wires over GPR and EMI sensors alone.  Mature sensor components to TRL 5 within 24 months from the start of the effort.  Explore methods for integrating those sensors into a single multi-sensor handheld detector solution.   <br>  <br> 4. Investigate and design integrated solutions for tracking the position of all detection sensors during operation.  In order to improve the performance of future handheld explosive hazard detection sensors, accurate positioning information is desired.  Positioning information is valuable for online operation in the field and for offline data collections used for algorithm development.  To accurately evaluate algorithm performance, sensor position information must be accurate to the centimeter level.  Sensor tracking design solutions shall output time-stamped 3D positional data to feed automated detection algorithms and displays for user visualization.  Mature position sensor components to TRL 5 within 24 months from the start of the effort.   <br>  <br> 5. Investigate user interface display designs capable of providing additional information on targets encountered and feedback of sensor responses and position.  Investigate methods to present data from all sensors to the user with both 2D and 3D visual representations on a display that can be mounted or integrated on the detector.  Investigate display techniques that allow users to identify which sensor(s) alarmed on the object and provide additional information such as estimated depth to target, size and shape of target or other information that will help the user further discriminate targets of interest from clutter objects.  Investigate methods to provide visual feedback to operators on swing speed, coverage area and gaps in coverage, sensor height from the ground, and other feedback useful for operator training and improved swing techniques.  This visual feedback can be a modular component so as not to distract the operator during missions. <br>  <br> 6. Investigate techniques for achieving higher signal to noise ratios with all sensor components including techniques to stack detection signals and incorporate sensor positioning information to further improve detection localization, target identification, multi-target resolution and clutter discrimination.  <br>  <br> 7. Explore new detection algorithms making use of enhanced sensor data and positional information to further improve detection localization, target identification, multi-target resolution and clutter discrimination.  <br>     <br> 8. Investigate designs to integrate sensor components with positioning sensors to validate proof of concepts for new handheld detector approaches.  Investigate lightweight structural materials and novel sources of power to reduce detector size, weight and power requirements for an integrated sensor solution.  Mature the design of a fully integrated multi-sensor solution with position sensors to TRL 5 within 36 months from the start of the effort.       <br>   <br> 9. Validate all sensors, display designs and algorithms ability to detect buried explosive hazard targets of interest to better understand the advantages and challenges of integrating local positioning data with sensor data for further discrimination capabilities.  <br>  <br>  <br> Responders should identify up to three relevant contracts and describe specific engineering experience, knowledge, understanding, and expertise under NAICS code 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  <br>  <br> The Government requests that interested offerors submit an electronic response of not more than twenty (20) pages, 8.5 quote mark  x 11 quote mark  paper, 12 pitch, Times New Roman font, with a minimum of one (1) inch margins all around.

The Government will in no way be bound to this information if a solicitation is issued.  Should funding be made available for this potential requirement, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on this or the FedBid website.  <br>  <br> The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the potential acquisition is 334220.  Any responses to this notice expressing interest in being considered for this proposed contract should include the following:  Company Name, Point of Contact, Address, Telephone number, E-mail address, Brief Description of the Company and Capabilities, Business Size, DUNS number, Cage Code, and Tax ID Number.  Notice to Potential Offerors:  All offerors who provide goods or services to the Department of Defense (DOD) must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) formerly Central Contractor Registration (CCR).   <br>  <br> All interested HubZone small business offerors should submit their capability statement by email to:  Regina.c.belford.civ@mail.mil no later than 13 February 2015. <br>  <br> Discription of Requirement: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> General: <br> 	The U.S. Army White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) Electromagnetic Radiation Effects (EMRE) facility has been the largest open air tests (OATS) facility for many years.  The facility was built up to provide full body illumination testing of very large vehicle systems.  Many large test items come to EMRE every year to conduct their mandatory Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) testing.  Recently, many of our customers have been asking for the ability to perform radiated susceptibility testing on small items within our shielded enclosure <br> 	It has been determined that the current amplifiers at EMRE covering the frequency range of 10 kilo-Hertz (kHz) - 400 Mega Hertz (MHz) cannot accomplish this task due to their high power.  It is therefore necessary to obtain an amplifier capable of a frequency range of 10 kHz - 400 MHz bandwidth with an output power of 200 watts (W) throughout the range. <br>    <br> Usage: <br> 	The amplifier is to be used for testing of equipment to MIL-STD-461F.  The primary purpose is to provide the required field intensity for radiated susceptibility testing in a shielded enclosure.  A secondary purpose is to provide a necessary backup amplifier that can be used for Conducted Susceptibility CS114 testing. The current system used is the standalone Conducted Immunity System CI00400, which has a 100 Watt amplifier integrated with a signal generator and power meter.  This new 200 Watt amplifier needs to be able to respond to changes in frequencies with very minimal signal distortion, be able to sustain continuous operation for at least 8 hours and use industry standard connectors for the input RF, the output RF, and AC power.  <br>  <br> Performance: <br> Operating Frequency Range: minimum 10 kHz - 400MHz; increased range is acceptable, example: 9 kHz - 500 MHz. <br> Operating Voltage: 120 to 260 VAC <br> Operating Current: 5 to 20 amps <br> Input signal level: up to 0 dBm <br> Input signal modulation: CW, AM, FM, PM <br> Output signal level: 200 Watts minimum and 250 Watts maximum throughout the frequency range. <br> Control Interface: GPIB <br> RF Input: N Type female <br> RF output: N type female <br> Forward and Reflected sample ports: N type female or BNC female <br> Maximum dimensions: 24 quote mark  x 24 quote mark  x 24' inches <br>  <br> Deliverables: <br> One amplifier that meets the performance requirements as stated throughout this document. <br> One printed operation manual. <br> One printed schematic manual showing details down to the circuit card level. <br> One list of the bill of materials (BOM) and recommended spare part; can be printed but must be included with the electronic copy of manuals. <br> One CD or DVD containing an electronic copy of all manuals. <br> AC electrical cord required for operation. <br> Copies of all test data showing acceptable performance, to include data for all test levels (i.e. forward power, reflected power, input signal level, operating voltages and operating currents). <br>  <br> The successful bidder will also show a proven capability to build similar amplifiers with existing designs being preferable. <br>  <br> 	Upon delivery of the amplifier, it will be necessary to have a 30 day test period to ensure there are no hazardous effects on the existing system.  This test time will include operation of the amplifier across the designed frequency range and with the stated modulations. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Point of Contact(s):  <br> Regina Belford, Contract Specialist, Phone 575-678-1931, Email:  Regina.c.belford.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address:  <br> Department of the Army, Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC), WSMR Contracting, Bldg 143, 2nd Floor, Crozier Street, White Sands Missile Range, NM, 88002-5201, UNITED STATES  <br>

<SUBJECT>Off-grid Clean Energy Solutions for Benin
<SOLNBR>MCC-15-RFI-0001
<RESPDATE>030615
<CONTACT>Jennifer M. Crouse, Email benin@mcc.gov
<DESC>Introduction<br />The Government of the United States, through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), is developing a $300 million compact with the Government of Benin (GOB) focused on Benin's electrical power sector.  The compact is expected to be signed in August 2015.
<p>In order to inform the preparation of the compact, MCC and its partner GOB agency, the Unit&eacute; de Coordination de la Formulation du 2eme Programme et Suivi des Reformes de MCA-Benin (UCF) invite interested companies and organizations from around the world to submit information regarding potential projects that would expand access to renewable off-grid electrical power in Benin.  MCC and UCF will use the information to determine whether to design a matching grant facility to provide matching funding to a project sponsor towards the overall cost of a clean energy project in Benin.  Final project selection decisions would be determined at a later date through a separate competitive grant application process to be launched following the signing of a proposed MCC compact with Benin.  Signing of the compact is subject to successful negotiation by the GoB and MCC, as well as MCC Board approval of a compact.</p>
<p>The Challenge<br />Only one-third of Benin's population of ten million has access to electrical power, with extraordinary spatial disparities - over half of urban residents have access to electricity, while only 4.5% of rural inhabitants do.  Electricity consumption in Benin is below average for Africa's low-income countries at 110 kWh/capita per year - equivalent to only 0.01% of the average for middle-income economies.</p>
<p>In addition to limited access, there are delays in connecting new customers and the front-end cost for connection is high relative to average annual income.  Benin's electrical power network is characterized by high technical and commercial losses in the distribution network totaling 22%, extensive outages in distribution (planned outages, rationing and unscheduled cuts), and poor quality service</p>
<p>Benin relies on most of its electricity from a company jointly owned by the Governments of Benin and Togo, the Communaut&eacute; Electrique du Benin (CEB), which is responsible for power generation and transmission.  CEB in turn supplies power to Benin's national distribution company, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; B&eacute;ninoise d'Energie Electrique (SBEE).  As CEB's own production capacity is limited, the company has depended on imports of electricity from neighboring countries such as Ghana and Nigeria, which have not been a reliable source of supply due to growing demand in the region.</p>
<p>Demand is also growing rapidly in Benin, having doubled in the past decade and is forecasted to double again in the next five years, only accounting for on-grid consumers.  Given supply shortages to meet this growing demand, SBEE meets some of its own electricity needs using hydropower and diesel generation to supplement supply from CEB.  These sources, however, have proven far from sufficient.  In 2012, 99% of Benin's on-grid electric energy supply of 1,065.4 GWh was imported (primarily from Nigeria), while only one percent (8.34 GWh) was provided through SBEE's own thermal and hydroelectric generation assets.</p>
<p>In addition to CEB and SBEE, there are two other major organizations in the energy sector within the Government of Benin, both of which reside in the Ministere de l'Energie, des Recherches Petrolieres et Minieres de l'Eau et du D&eacute;veloppment des Energies Renouvelable (MERPMEDER). These include the newly-established Agence Nationale des Energies Renouvelables (ANADER) and Agence Beninoise de l'Energie Renouvelable et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ABERME). Having only been established in June 2014, ANADER is still a new organization, but the intent of the Government of Benin is for it to ultimately be responsible for all projects related to clean energy and off-grid electrification.  ABERME is the entity responsible for rural electrification and has previously implemented energy efficiency and clean energy projects, though in the future its responsibilities will likely center around on-grid rural electrification.</p>
<p>Due to growing concerns with energy shortfalls the Government of Benin is pursuing new domestic sources of generation, both to service on- and off-grid customers.  The MCC Benin compact will assist Benin in the development of both on and off-grid solutions to meet the country's power shortfalls.  <br /> <br />The solution<br />MCC and UCF are interested in potential project information and concepts to address one of the following potential focus areas:</p>
<p>1.	Critical public infrastructure such as water treatment and pumping facilities, hospitals, health clinics, courts, universities, schools, and ports.  The focus of these projects would be to install relevant equipment/systems along with an administrative framework for operations, maintenance, and replacement of the equipment/systems with the concerned organization.  Examples could include solar PV systems with storage, biomass generation units, mini-hydro plants, etc.</p>
<p>2.	Community and commune-level electricity generation and distribution to provide relevant equipment/systems along with an administrative framework for a mini-grid, including billing, operations, maintenance, and replacement of the equipment/systems with the concerned communities or communes.  Examples could include solar PV systems with storage, biomass generation units, mini-hydro plants, etc. along with relevant distribution infrastructure.  While MCC and UCF will not provide funding for productive uses of electrical power (e.g. drip irrigation, refrigerated storage, or other agricultural processing equipment), project sponsors may count resources dedicated towards those purposes towards the matching fund requirement.</p>
<p>3.	Household-level generation and storage.  Household-level systems such as pay as you go solar PV kits have expanded dramatically in recent years in many countries.  The focus of these projects would be to create viable businesses in Benin that import, install and repair household level PV and other technologies available on the marketplace.  Cellular penetration in Benin is very high and mobile banking is growing very rapidly, providing opportunities for entrepreneurs entering the market with lease to own, pay as you go, franchising or other business models.</p>
<p>4.	Energy efficiency measures.  Energy efficient appliances and equipment reduce lifecycle costs for electricity customers and reduce demands on the grid.  The focus of this project would be to develop and deploy business models for the deployment of energy efficient appliances and other equipment for government, household, and commercial users.</p>
<p>Nature and range of possible funding<br />If the facility is included in a potential compact, it is expected that awards thereunder will be in the form of a matching cash grant to a project sponsor for the purpose of sharing in half the total cost of the project. It is further expected that the project sponsor will provide at least half (50%) of the total project cost in cash or through in-kind services.  For projects sponsored by not-for-profit organizations, faith-based organizations, academic institutions, rural communities and communes, the cost sharing will be at least 35% of the total capital cost of the project from the sponsor and 65% of the total capital cost of the project from the facility.</p>
<p>Although the range of any grant under a proposed grant facility would be determined at a later date, it is currently contemplated that grant awards could range in size from $100,000 to $5 million, though the final range will be determined based in part on information received as part of this Call for Ideas.</p>
<p>Who may submit information<br />The project sponsor submitting information may be from any category of organizations or institutions, US or non-US, with operations or intent to establish operations in Benin. Specific categories of organizations, institutions, and entrepreneurs that are welcome to respond include but are not limited to: educational, industrial, not-for-profit and for-profit organizations, faith-based organizations, academic institutions, civic groups, regional organizations, international organizations, bilateral or multilateral donors, public agency or enterprise of the Government of Benin, vendors, start-ups, and project developers. Interested parties may submit information for more than one project/concept/idea.</p>
<p>Information requested<br />Information requested in this announcement should total no more than five pages and address the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	A brief description of the proposed project, including the objective, nature of the proposed activities (e.g., technical assistance, capital works design and construction, operations and maintenance) <br />&bull;	Anticipated benefits and costs (may use data from similar countries if Benin-specific data is unavailable)<br />&bull;	Number and description of beneficiaries, if known<br />&bull;	Geographic location, if known <br />&bull;	Local partner organizations, if applicable<br />&bull;	Description of approach to sustainability, such as summary of business plan or organizational model for recuperating costs and performing operations, maintenance and replacement of equipment.  A business plan should describe <br />o	The approach to collecting revenue, marketing, and other aspects of business operations<br />o	The approach for ensuring an organization has the technical and resource capacity to conduct or procure operations, maintenance and replacement of the equipment<br />o	How the project can over the long term be replicated at scale and how grants may be phased out over time<br />o	Where applicable, how costs may be decreased with innovation, future improvements in technology or economies of scale and how revenues may increase over time with improvements in project output or productivity  <br />&bull;	Description of technologies to be employed such as:<br />o	Solar photovoltaic systems with or without smart grid or thermal or concentrated solar technologies<br />o	Biomass/biogas from organic waste or vegetative materials<br />o	Hydropower including run of river systems and storage or pumped storage<br />o	Wind power systems<br />o	Hybrid or other non-fossil fuel power generation technologies</p>
<p>The information may be provided in English or French.</p>
<p>Deadline<br />Organizations should provide the information requested by March 6, 2015 to benin@mcc.gov.</p>
<p>Use of information by MCC/UCF<br />MCC and UCF will use the information received under this request to inform final decisions regarding the inclusion of a matching grant facility in the proposed Benin compact, including scope, budget, implementation methodologies, and timeline.  If the compact includes the matching grant facility, is approved by MCC's Board of Directors and is signed by both governments, project sponsors may be contacted to provide additional information through a separate request for proposals at a later date.  The information received by MCC and UCF will be kept in strict confidentiality and will not be shared with external parties.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. If a solicitation is issued at a later date, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Division of Clinical Research (DCR), rapidly deploys administrative &amp; technical research support services and resources to meet the external demands placed on the NIAID to conduct time sensitive, high priority, global, collaborative clinical research critical to the mission of the NIAID and advancement of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Health &amp; Human Services (DHHS) Global Health Agendas. Fulfillment of this mission requires DCR to have the capacity to expeditiously facilitate collaborative clinical research both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>The following key factors are the basis for the requirement described in this document:</p>
<p>I. In recent years, the NIAID research portfolio has expanded considerably in response to new challenges such as bio-terrorism and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The DCR supports the NIAID goals by providing administrative and management support which facilitates high quality clinical research in this challenging and expanding environment.</p>
<p>II. In support of the expanding demands placed on the NIAID to rapidly respond to challenges such as bio-terrorism and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, the DCR is proactively anticipating the delegation of additional Special Projects which will demand that the DCR expeditiously establish collaborative clinical research programs in the domestic and international arenas. Requests for projects of this nature could emanate from sources such as the U.S. Congress, U.S. State Department, DHHS, NIH, or NIAID.</p>
<p>III. Examples of current NIAID, DCR Special Projects underway:</p>
<p>&#61607; The NIAID support &amp; collaboration in the Southeast Asia Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network [SEA ICRN]: A multi-lateral, collaborative partnership of hospitals and institutions in Indonesia, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam, to advance the scientific knowledge and management of human influenza through integrated, collaborative clinical research with the aim of improving patient care and human health. <br />&#61607; NIAID support &amp; collaboration in the special project entitled Phidisa: a HIV/AIDS research collaboration between the NIAID and the South African National Defense Force (SANDF). Since 2004 the NIAID investigators have collaborated with investigators from the SANDF to establish and maintain the necessary administrative and technical infrastructure needed to support the clinical research agendas in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and disorders of the immune system, specifically Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in South Africa. The goal of this collaborative clinical research effort, has been to conduct a program of clinical research that is of critical importance to the NIH and South Africa and in the process, to establish a sustainable clinical research infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>The requirements described herein are intended to provide the capacity to proactively identify and establish technical and administrative management services for NIAID'S collaborative research efforts. The requirement for this acquisition is to provide DCR or other NIAID Offices, Divisions, and Centers with the ability to rapidly establish resources for collaborations between the NIAID and government agencies, academia, and health research entities domestically or internationally. Requirements for future Task Orders will be issued for the services described herein and based on NIAID's Special Projects. The contractors' role will be one of technical support and administrative management services.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>&bull; The base period of performance will be five years from the date of award.</p>
<p>Place of Performance</p>
<p>&bull; The place of performance will be determined as Special Project requirements arise.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY</strong>. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire services. Responses to this RFI will be treated as information only. As such, the Government will not entertain questions concerning this RFI. The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests. The information provided may be used by the Social Security Administration in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work. <br /><br />The Social Security Administration (SSA) is issuing this RFI to identify capable companies and exchange information with industry related to its efforts to obtain a cloud based application of RSMeans Costworks subscription (or equivalent) for SSA's Digital Library. The application should provide accurate and up-to-date cost information that will assist owners, developers, architects, engineers, contractors and others, to project and control the cost of both new building construction and renovation projects. The application should also provide access to detailed construction cost data, along with assembly and whole building cost data under one user interface with at least 15 concurrent users with secure passwords. This product would need to ensure that SSA complies with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements. <br /><br />The contractor shall be able to provide the following requirements:<br />&bull; Building Construction Cost Data <br />&bull; Concrete &amp; Masonry Cost <br />&bull; Facilities Maintenance &amp; Repair <br />&bull; Repair &amp; Remodeling Cost <br />&bull; Green Project Planning <br />&bull; Heavy Construction Cost <br />&bull; Bldg Construction Cost (Metric) <br />&bull; Bldg Construction Cost Open Shop <br />&bull; Mechanical Cost <br />&bull; Electrical Cost<br />&bull; Plumbing Cost<br />&bull; Site Work &amp; Landscape<br />&bull; Residential Repair and Remodel<br />&bull; Facilities Construction Cost<br />&bull; Assemblies Cost<br />&bull; Estimator<br />&bull; Residential Cost<br />&bull; Commercial Squre Foot Cost<br />&bull; Light Commercial Cost <br />&bull; Interior Cost<br /><br />A cloud based application will be a resource used by the Office of Facilities nationwide to plan for construction and repair-related costs to SSA buildings.<br /><br />SSA requests that companies provide feedback on any major concerns they have with the stated capabilities. SSA also requests the companies to provide any comments or suggestions to the stated capabilities. Interested companies with the capability of providing the requirement shall submit capability statements that demonstrate their expertise in sufficient detail, including any other specific and relevant information, so the Government can determine the firm's experience and capability to provide the requirements. Failure to demonstrate the capability of providing the requirement in response to this market survey may affect the Government's review of the industry's ability to perform or provide these requirements. SSA also requests that companies provide information regarding the availability of their services on existing contract vehicles, such as GSA, SEWP, and other agency IDIQ contracts.<br /><br />In addition to capability statements, firms must include this information in their responses: (1) organization name, address, email address, website address, and telephone number; (2) size and socioeconomic designation of the organization [i.e. small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), etc.].<br /><br />Responses from industry MUST be submitted via email to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scott.Pinney@ssa.gov</span> by <strong>February 13, 2015 at 1:00PM EST</strong>. No phone calls will be accepted. The subject line of the submission should read "<em>0919-15-1011</em>".<br /><br />NOTE: There is a size limit for email; no submission shall be greater than 5 MB.<br /><br />We emphasize that this RFI is for planning and information purposes. No solicitation exists; therefore, requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored.

<CONTACT>Lorenza S. Ladao, Email lladao@SLAC.stanford.edu
<DESC>SLAC seeks vendors that can provide a Solid State Amplifier (SSA) System for use in the Booster accelerator for the SPEAR3 electron storage ring.
<p><br />The Booster for the SPEAR3 storage ring at SLAC requires a radio-frequency (RF) amplifier that operates at an fRF of 358.54 MHz and can deliver a minimum peak output power of 45 kW. The booster cycles at a 10 Hz rate. The RF power cycles during this 100 ms time in a non-sinusoidal way. It is ramped from a low power level to its peak power during the cycle when the beam is in the Booster ring. After the beam is ejected from the ring the power is quickly decreased. The average power required during this ramp is slightly greater than 4 kW.<br /><br />SLAC requires the SSA to have an extremely high reliability and availability and would like it to operate without a system failure during each beam delivery "run" period of 44 weeks. SLAC will replace any failed individual components during our annual 8 week maintenance period. In order to have a safety margin on the required output power and to allow for operation in the case of failures of some components, it is seeking an SSA with a peak power of 64 kW.<br /><br />The SSA will output into a user-supplied circulator matched at 358.54 MHz which, in turn, will drive the user's high-Q RF cavity. The SSA should be very stable and have a bandwidth that enables it to act in a feedback loop that will stabilize the load voltage and power.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. VENDORS INTERESTED IN BEING CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE SHOULD IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS AN "INTERESTED PARTY" VIA THE FBO PORTAL. DO NOT CONTACT THE SUBCONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR.</p>

<p>1. High-Clearance Tractor/Sprayer</p>
<p>2. Cab - air conditioned with charcoal filtration system</p>
<p>3. Hydraulic up/down/in/out - hydraulically-adjustable row width (74 in. -120 in.) &amp; hydraulically-adjustable clearance (60 in. - 84 in.)</p>
<p>4. Plus 1 GPS-based speed control</p>
<p>5. One large solution tank (110 gal) and a minimum of two additional 17 gal cone bottom tanks mounted to the frame of the high-clearance tractor/sprayer</p>
<p>6. Hydraulic centrifugal pump mounted to high-clearance tractor/sprayer frame</p>
<p>7. Front lift - front boom lift with dual parallel arms</p>
<p>8. Rear telescopic lift - telescoping rear boom lift</p>
<p>9. Boom - 45-ft hydraulic X-fold (must be street legal in Mississippi when loaded on trailer)</p>
<p>10. Raven 440 automatic spray controller - automatically controls spray volume on 3 boom sections using GPS speed monitor</p>
<p>11. Electric dual air compressor - dual 1.66-cfm 12 v compressors complete with 5 gallon storage tank</p>

<p>The Lee Avenger sprayer and trailer is necessary to expand on-farm research across the Mississippi Delta designed to better evaluate the impact of various insecticides on population dynamics and susceptibility of noctuid and hemipteran pests of southern row crops. LeeAgra, Inc., is the sole source of this type of research sprayer with a cab to protect the operator from exposure to pesticides. There is no other known product on the market that offers a custom built sprayer that meets the research needs of the unit and protects the operator from exposure to pesticides with a cab.</p>
<p>The equipment will be used for studying the effects of various suppression techniques (Bt technologies, synthetic insecticides, etc.) on insect populations infesting the diverse cropping systems of the Mississippi Delta. To meet the research requirements, a sprayer designed specifically for research purposes is needed that can be safely operated and transported around the Mississippi Delta frequently. LeeAgra, Inc., is the only known source available that produces such a sprayer/trailer combination that is designed to fit the research needs and restricts the operator's exposure to pesticides.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The equipment will be located at the USDA, ARS, SEA, Stoneville, MS. The Government intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on or about February 23, 2015. This Notice of Intent is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposals (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted via mail to the Contracting Officer at the following address:</p>

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE AND REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.205(c) and FAR 15.201(e) this announcement constitutes a special notice concerning a contemplated technology challenge and an official Request For Information (RFI). <br>  <br> This notice and RFI are issued for market research and for planning purposes only and shall not be considered a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), shall not be considered an obligation from the Government to acquire any products or services, and shall not be considered an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  Submitting information in response to this special notice and RFI (to include capabilities and concepts) is voluntary and participants shall not be compensated; unless otherwise stated, this special notice and RFI, as well as interchanges and exchanges at any Government-sponsored events, is considered informational-only for participants and the Government.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to pursue any course of action described herein. <br>  <br> The purpose of this special notice is to seek responses to the RFI stated below in order to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of participants (U.S. citizens and U.S. companies only) for the effort described below.  The intent of the RFI is to identify market interest and solicit U.S. Department of Defense industry solutions and recommendations for the effort described below.  The Government is also considering sponsoring a live-fire technology demonstration at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), NM, potentially resulting in market stimulation prize(s) ranging from $1-$5 million dollars for the most successful participants.  The decision to pursue awarding prize(s) will be based on the responses received from this RFI identifying the advances industry has made or is capable of making in the current state-of-the-art of laser weapon systems, as well as appropriate approvals and funding.  If the Government decides to pursue market stimulation prize(s), then further notification will be provided.  Note that a decision regarding whether the Government may split this dollar amount into multiple prize awards for the most promising and successful demonstrations has not been finalized.  As noted above, the use of a prize award in support of the live-fire technology demonstration outlined in this notice is pending approval and funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and/or U.S. Department of Army.  The Government may also elect to utilize traditional processes such as use of a Broad Agency Announcement in conjunction with or in lieu of the prize challenge. <br>  <br> Subject to appropriate approvals and funding, as well as responses to this Special Notice/RFI, the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT), Redstone Arsenal, AL, on the behalf of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Research and Technology) and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASAALT), is partnering with the Army Program Executive Office - Missiles and Space (PEO M&S) and the Fort Sill Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) to host a High Energy Laser (HEL) industry live-fire technology demonstration at WSMR, NM in November 2015.  The Government desires to assess and stimulate industry's current laser weapon system state-of-the-art to defeat RAM and UAV threats that may guide decisions on incorporating solid state laser weapons into the Army inventory.  To this end, USASMDC/ARSTRAT intends to invite industry (U.S. Department of Defense contractors) to participate in a live-fire technology demonstration to be conducted at WSMR, NM, in November 2015.  At a minimum, a potential participant must verify its readiness to participate in the demonstration by satisfying a number of criteria, to include: <br>  <br>  	Must be Laser Clearing House (LCH) compliant for above horizon engagements; <br>  <br>  	Must be Information Assurance compliant - must be certified to collect classified data; <br>  <br>  	Must operate in accordance with WSMR Safety Office requirements (WSMR safety requirements will be provided at the live-fire familiarization day discussed below); <br>  <br>  	Must provide all needed equipment and personnel (no government furnished equipment will be provided to the participants for use in their systems being demonstrated); <br>  <br>  	Must provide inputs to WSMR support requirements (support requirements and input method will be provided at the live-fire familiarization day discussed below); and  <br>  <br>  	Must agree to grant the Government a license in all collected data (whether from Government or participant systems) that permits use for any Government purposes as defined in DFARS 252.227-7013(a)(12) and DFARS 252.227-7014(a)(11). <br>  <br> The participant's system must meet the minimum safety performance standard identified below in order to participate in the live-fire technology demonstration at WSMR, NM.  Verifying the system meets the minimum safety performance standard is the first phase of the live-fire technology demonstration event; only systems that meet the required standard will be allowed to participate in the live-fire technology demonstration.  The live-fire technology demonstration is a series of engagements against dynamic small-caliber mortar rounds, as well as Class II and/or Class I UAVs, in scenarios of increasing difficulty.  Details of the scenarios will be provided at a Participants Day discussed below.  Note that part of the live-fire technology demonstration is repositioning the participant's system and conducting additional engagements (emplace   engage   displace   move   emplace   engage   displace).  Additionally, there will be time constraints on the scenarios and all engagements will be against above-the-horizon dynamic targets. <br>  <br> The Government will develop an acceptable range of atmospheric conditions where target engagements may be conducted.  If conditions are outside the acceptable range, then a  quote mark non-engagement quote mark  will be declared for that time period and the engagements rescheduled.  The Government will also collect atmospheric data to help with the post-demonstration assessment and support lethality data base development.  If the Government chooses to award market stimulation prize(s) as a result of the live-fire technology demonstration, then scoring criteria will be presented at the Participants Day discussed below. <br>  <br> Participants also must be aware that USASMDC/ARSTRAT has a security classification guide (SCG) concerning the development of laser weapon technology (High Energy Laser Tactical Technology Development and Demonstration Security Classification Guide (SCG), dated November 26, 2013).  This guide discusses what information must be protected and at what level(s).  All participants taking part in this live-fire technology demonstration must have the capability to handle classified data and agree to conduct all phases of planning and demonstration in accordance with the stated USASMDC/ARSTRAT SCG.  Participants should also note that the USASMDC/ARSTRAT SCG covers Government approval of public statements, photos, and videos relating to this live-fire demonstration prior to release. <br>  <br> Prior to departing the live-fire demonstration conducted at WSMR, NM, each participant will be required to provide data in engineering units to the Government to assist in the assessment of the demonstration.  This data may include (but is not limited to) time of target lock-on by the tracking system, accurate laser on and off times, laser segment power for each engagement, video (if available) from the laser tracker, etc.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT will coordinate with each participant to help determine the classification level of data products.  <br>  <br> The Government intends to provide the following to the live-fire participants: <br>  <br>  	Security classification guidance for data collected during the demonstration; <br>  <br>  	Minimum safety performance standard (draft standards are stated below): <br>  <br> o	Range Safety:  Range safety expertise will be provided by WSMR.  Participants will be required to submit system safety plans for approval by the WSMR Safety Office.  Inability to gain approval of plans and procedures by the WSMR Safety Office will result in the elimination of the participant from the live-fire demonstration.  The test range will coordinate with the Federal Aviation Administration and aircraft within WSMR boundaries to ensure no aircraft are endangered by laser operations associated with this live-fire demonstration. <br>  <br> o	Satellite Protection:  Satellite protection from lasers will be provided by the LCH.  Each participant will be required to obtain LCH clearance in order to propagate its laser systems above the horizon with proper satellite safety measures.  Inability to gain LCH approval of planning and operational procedures will result in the elimination of the participant from the live-fire demonstration.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT will assist participants in acquiring predictive avoidance model (PAM) files from LCH for use in their systems. <br>  <br> o	Voice Communication:  Voice communication with the participant's demonstration crew to ensure the laser system is ready to conduct live fire exercises. <br>  <br> o	Cue and Track:  Cueing sensor data will be provided by an AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel, or other radar systems, with a Government provided radar crew.  A set of two mortar rounds will be expended to ensure the vendor's system can be operated safely to include: response to government live-fire demonstration director firing commands, receiving and processing the target cue, tracking mortar rounds at a range of 1.5 km in a crossing trajectory; <br>  <br>  	Desired operational performance to negate a limited set of mortar rounds and UAVs.  This performance is being defined with associated technical and operational scoring criteria and will be provided to participants; <br>  <br>  	Appropriate WSMR resources to support the live-fire technology demonstration.  Participants will be required to define their specific range support requirements; <br>  <br>  	All participants will be provided the same number and types of targets to include 60 mm mortar rounds, and Class II and/or Class I UAVs.  The targets will be launched by a Government crew on command from a Government Demonstration Director; and  <br>  <br>  	Target lethality data. <br>  <br> Note that truth data will be collected by the Government to include (but not limited to): atmospheric data, visible and infrared optical data from tracking mounts, radar cue data, and UAV flight path data.  Additionally, a Government Joint Assessment Team (JAT) will assess the results and determine prizes, if provided, in accordance with the assessment criteria.  Details on the potential prizes will be provided at Participants Day described below. <br>  <br> USASMDC/ARSTRAT plans to host a Participants Day associated with this RFI (note that participants must be approved to attend).  The Participants Day is tentatively scheduled for March 6, 2015 at USASMDC/ARSTRAT, Building 5220, Room 3017 Redstone, AL (approved participants will be notified or an amendment to this Special Notice/RFI will provide the exact time and duration of the participants day).  The primary purpose of the Participants Day is to provide an overview of the Army's plans for the live-fire technology demonstration and to answer questions from participants related to these plans.  This Participants Day will be open to U.S. Department of Defense contractors that have the capability to handle classified data at least at the secret level.  Due to facility space limitations and sensitivity or security classification level of the information that will be provided, prospective participants must request attendance and provide the single page capabilities summary and draft quad chart described below.  The Participants Day will also afford an opportunity for participants to interact relative to this topic. <br>  <br> Each participant may bring up to three (3) individuals for attendance (three total attendees per request).  After receipt of the capabilities summary and draft quad chart, potential participants will be notified by Ms. Dianne Trimble, Army Contracting Command-Redstone, or her representative no later than February 24, 2015 with details regarding the Participants Day and invitation.  No one will be allowed to attend the Participants Day without receiving an invitation (note that space limitation may limit the number of participants).  Submit all visit requests via JPAS to SMO Code W4T8AA8 and reference this RFI number.  Visit requests should be submitted no later than February 25, 2015.

Security POCs are Mr. Lovett Bennett (256) 955-4950 and Ms. Di Cochran (256) 955-4200.  Please include both security POCs on all visit requests.  An amendment to this Special Notice/RFI will be issued via FEDBIZOPPS detailing any changes or additional requested information. <br>  <br> For planning purposes, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is also considering hosting a range familiarization day associated with this RFI (note that potential participants who attended the Participants Day and submitted the 25-page white paper will be invited to participate in this range visit).  The live-fire range familiarization day is tentatively scheduled for April 21-24, 2015 at WSMR, NM.  The purpose of the range familiarization day will be for the Government range personnel to provide an overview of requirements for laser operations on the range, as well as for participants to provide an overview of their laser system plans for the demonstration.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can be viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		8540-00-262-7178<br />Name:		Towel, Paper, Single-Fold, Natural, 9-1/4" W<br />Description:	9-1/4" W, unbleached, single-fold, Kraft paper towel designed for use in bathroom dispenser NSN 4510-00-224-8549. The natural, heavyweight, towels contain environmentally preferred minimum 40% post-consumer recovered materials (PCRM.) Each towel is 99 square inches overall and has a fold depth of 5-1/2". UOI is BX. BX = 4,000 towels (16 sleeves per box, 250 towels per sleeve).</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			8540-00-262-7178<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	BWK12GREEN; 23504; SCASK1850A; BW 470; WAU47000; T9AB1143830; T9AB240995; T9AB1542017; S-17203; 36P068; 468780</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than February 23, 2015 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The program should be designed to help fellows better understand U.S. seafood products including varieties available for export to Turkey. The Turkish seafood industry has grown rapidly in recent years, including: local production, consumption, imports/exports. Imports from the U.S. are also increasing but can advance with further promotion and exposure to seafood varieties. The local catch is declining due to excessive harvesting and local production is limited to a few varieties. Topics should include: seafood marketing, storage, packaging, and food safety. The program objective is to assist with the promotion of U.S. seafood and expose the Fellows to various products such as lobster, crabs, scallops, shrimp, oysters, and smoked salmon. The program should include the Boston Seafood Show (March 15-17) along with meetings with various cooperators. The Food Export USA-Northeast Region has consented to arranging meetings with exporters the day before and<br />day after the Seafood Show. Visits to various seafood exporters' facilities should be included in the North East Region. The goal of this activity is to introduce U.S. seafood varieties in an effort to increase high value and traditional U.S. seafood exports to Turkey.<br /><br /><br />Training schedule must include visits to the two day Boston Seafood Show, a two hour meeting on both the 14th and the 18th with exporters before and after the Boston Seafood show (for a total of at least 4 hours), as well as any travel time. The proposal shall include guaranteed that hotel accommodations for the participants, however, the 6 Turkish participants will pay for their lodging costs. Vendor is recommended to request government rates for lodging and training space. A tax exempt form can be provided for lodging and training space costs. All costs shall be itemized (broken down by cost type-travel, lodging, registration costs, etc.) and listed in the proposal. Translation and interpretation services will not be required as all participants speak English.

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.

(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. section 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. section 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

The BPA duration will be for a one-year base period and may be extended in one-year increments not to exceed a total of three-years for the BPA. The establishment of the BPA does not imply any agreement on the part of the Government to place future calls, orders or contracts with the BPA holder. The Government makes no representation as to the number of calls or actual amount of work to be ordered. Interested firms must identify their interest and capability to perform to the requirements set forth in this solicitation/synopsis to be considered for award of the solicited BPAs. The awarded BPA will be an agreement capable of fulfilling the requirements of performance for the 182 Airlift Wing as stated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and in accordance with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) throughout the complete period of performance as established by the specific award. No calls (orders) will exceed the amount of $15,000. The aggregate amount of the BPA will be approximately $50,000 per year for a maximum $150,000 for the total three-year duration of all options. ALL OFFERS ARE TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SOLICITATION. The Government will evaluate all submitted responses in accordance with the submissions and evaluation criteria described herein as part of a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Process. The purpose of this description is to establish a uniform submission and evaluation procedure for the technical evaluation of responses by the Government and the development of a Best Value Decision. In as much, the submittal shall describe the capability of the Offeror to perform the requirements and be specific and complete. The proposal should be prepared simply and economically, providing a straightforward and concise description of capabilities to satisfactorily perform all requirements. The proposal should be practical, legible, clear, and coherent. The Contracting Officer will award a BPA to those responsible Offeror(s) whose submittals conforms to the solicitation/synopsis and offers the best overall value to the Government, considering all factors described herein. The Government will not award a BPA to an Offeror whose submittal does not adhere to submission requirements. <br />FACTOR 1: BUSINESS TYPE/CLASSIFICATION &amp; FIRM INFORMATION.</p>
<p>GENERAL: It is the objective of this solicitation/synopsis to give priority consideration to those firms who are classified as (1) Small Business per SBA identifications, (2) meet the qualifications as established by the Small Business Administration and (3) preference to firms located in the Peoria, IL area. All Offeror's shall provide a narrative detailing their small business status as well as the firm's information as requested in this solicitation/synopsis. Firms shall detail their level of self-performance for the required work and the level of all sub-contractors. Joint Venture partners should each demonstrate experience commensurate with their roles and<br />explain in the subject narrative how their experience qualifies them for their role for this BPA. The narrative shall also include the role and participation of each partner.</p>
<p>Included in this Factor is the requirement to submit price-lists and/or labor rates.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's narrative on the requirements as described herein. The Business Type/Classification &amp; Firm information narrative shall describe the Offeror's status as a small business, large business, joint venture, etc. The narrative shall list the System for Award Management (SAM) registration status (with current date or expiration), DUNS number and Cage Code as well as the NAICS codes as applicable. (A copy of the SAM page can be included as an attachment to this Factor for expedient review but is not required and if included, will not count as to the total page count for this factor.) If the Offeror identifies themselves as a small business, the classification shall be as defined by the SBA - that is, Women Owned, 8a, Service Disabled, etc.</p>
<p>The narrative shall include all information relevant to the firm as to address and primary office location, address of secondary or sub-contractor offices, telephone numbers, size, required certifications for applicable trades, and any other pertinent information directly related to the nature of the firm being submitted - that is, management-oversight, self-performing, etc. More<br />consideration will be given to those Offeror's who are self performing - that is, the primary business function of the firm is relevant to the PWS of this solicitation/synopsis.</p>
<p>Each firm submitting will be evaluated on a Go/No-Go basis for meeting SBA classification status. Priority consideration will be given to those firms who are classified as Small Business and meet the qualifications as established by the Small Business Administration. Any business not identified by classification in the submittal or identified as a Large Business will receive a No-Go determination.</p>
<p>The order of precedence for locality consideration is as follows: (1) those firms who are located within a 1-hour radius of the 182 Airlift Wing, Peoria, IL will be given the highest consideration; rated as highly acceptable; (2) firms located outside the 1-hour radius but with current and established relationships with local contractors within the 1-hour response window; rated as acceptable; (3) firms located out of state but with current and existing established relationships <br />with local contractors within the 1-hour response window; rated as marginal; (4) firms located out of state and no apparent current relationships in local area; rated as unacceptable - and as<br />such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.</p>
<p>Price lists or labor rates shall be shown for the trades as applicable to this solicitation/synopsis.</p>
<p><br />FACTOR 2: TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES.<br />SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's narrative on proposed capabilities in terms of electrical repair and maintenance considerations and the Offeror's approach to meeting requirements as described in the PWS.<br />Discuss, by trades, the approach required for all requirements of work, demonstrating the Offeror's understanding of the PWS. Discussions shall also address the firm's capability to respond and perform electrical repair and maintenance functions, as applicable. Greater consideration will be given to those Offerors who, as a function of their firm, primarily perform the type of work requirements as described in the PWS for the type of BPA being solicited. For<br />example, a solicitation/synopsis for a Electrical BPA would be directed to firms who do electrical work as a primary function of their business or electrical service is one of several major operations within the firm. A firm operating as a management oversight or pass thru type operation is less favorable for the intended BPA.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the capabilities submitted to ensure the Offeror has considered all requirements as listed in the PWS, to include response times and primary trade functions of the proposed firm. The Government will give greater consideration on work performed as a primary or self-performing contractor than as a management or oversight firm with respect to the type of<br />BPA being solicited. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows: (1) firm has a primary function as self-performing in the functions of the PWS; rated as highly acceptable; (2) firm performs at least 80% work of the PWS and subcontracts the rest to one specific firm in performance of the PWS; rated as acceptable; (3) firm is a multi-functional firm that performs at least 50% of the work and oversees other contractors in performance of the PWS; rated as marginal; (4) firm operates completely as a pass-thru or management over-sight firm; rated unacceptable - and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.</p>
<p><br />FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE/SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors shall be evaluated on their recent, relevant experience with experience similar in size, scope and complexity to the scope of work for this BPA. Past performance refers to the extent and quality of recent, relevant experience, from a subjective perspective. Offerors shall be evaluated on similar type services<br />and/or work completed or in progress in the last five years that are same and/or similar in nature to the BPA requirements being solicited. Offerors shall provide their team's recent, relevant experience with work similar in size, scope and complexity to the requirements in the PWS. Each firm will be rated on its own performance; a firm may not solely establish past performance<br />based on the past performance of a proposed subcontractor or firm, apart from that of the firm if the firm was acting in an oversight management type function. The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated to determine technical capability to perform the proposed services described in the BPA PWS. The information presented in the Offeror's submittal, together with that from other sources available to the Government (such as CPARS) will comprise the input for evaluation of this factor.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall provide project information on at least three (3) but no more than five (5) completed or current in-progress service type examples (preferably BPAs or other electrical service contracts) within the last five (5) years that best represent their experience relevant to the PWS for this BPA. As a minimum, provide the data as specified in the Past Performance Information (PPI) format shown in the following paragraph as part of the narrative submittal. This is a predominate method of evaluating past performance along with any accompanying narrative for that particular example.</p>
<p>COMPANY PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (PPI) NARRATIVE<br />ELECTRICAL SERVICES 182 AIRLIFT WING, PEORIA, IL<br />Use this suggested format as a guide per each example submitted. (This information along with the Supplemental Narrative shall be a maximum of two (2) pages.)<br />Firm's Name Accomplishing Work:<br />Type of Work:<br />Location of Work:<br />General Scope of Work:<br />Role (Prime, Joint Venture, Subcontractor, etc.) and Work Your Company Self -Performed (with % performed):<br />Describe Relevancy to this Requirement:<br />Cost (Dollar Value of Effort):<br />Contracting Officer and/or Owner's Point of Contact for Reference:<br />Name:<br />Company:<br />Telephone:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance to determine how relevant it is to the intended services being solicited. Work will be considered relevant to this effort if they are similar in complexity, type, scope, and/or magnitude. More relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance assessment than past performance of lesser relevance. Relevant qualifiers<br />include past governmental service agreements or contracts, experience in line with PWS description, and work in the Peoria, IL area/region. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows: (1) PPI and supplemental narrative with three (3) - five (5) relevant examples to the<br />PWS; rated as highly acceptable; (2) PPI only with three (3) - five (5) relevant examples to the PWS; rated as acceptable; (3) narrative only; rated as marginal; (4) no minimum examples or non-relevant experience will be rated as unacceptable and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.</p>
<p>Government type service past performance will be given greater consideration than non-Federal Government past performance. Recent and relevant work in and around the Peoria, IL area will be given greater consideration than other experience in other areas. The Government will<br />consider previous experience at the installation for which these BPA's will cover value added strength.</p>

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows: <br />STATEMENT OF NEED (SON)<br />DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)<br />NATIONAL OCEANIC ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA)<br />EARTH SYSTEM RESEARCH LABORATORY (ESRL)<br />GLOBAL MONITORING DIVISION (GMD)</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br />NOAA ESRL GMD Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases group maintains the CO2 standard scale used by the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) program, and they accurately propagate the scale in cylinders of natural air to other international participants in GAW. This vital international role insures that small spatial differences in atmospheric CO2 measured by international programs are real, and not an artifact of standards used. The calibration load is heavy; in 2014, 1377 calibrations were done. Each must be accurate, precise, and completed relatively quickly. During the past 10 years, developments in measurement technology allow improved precision and shorter analysis times, but they require that reasonably accurate measurements of &delta;13C and &delta;18O in CO2 accompany each calibration of CO2 abundance in standards. The current need has been met by an Aerodyne Research, Inc. brand analyzer, Inc. to meet that need.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: <br />As part of our responsibility as World Meteorological Organization, Central Calibration Laboratory for CO2, NOAA ESRL GMD needs a robust optical spectrometer that will accurately and precisely measure &delta;13C and &delta;18O in CO2 to &lt;0.05&permil; with 10 second averaging time.</p>
<p>If your requirement is a Brand Comparable to the Aerodyne Research, Inc. brands, please provide full specifications justifying the comparability of the brand offered.</p>
<p>0001: QUANTITY OF ONE LASER TRACE GAS ANALYZER FOR CO2 ISOTOPES.</p>

The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. HOWEVER, the Government may determine that a quote's pricing is "UNACCEPTABLE" if Price Analysis of the base year and option year prices show that option year prices are significantly "unbalanced" in comparison with the base year price. Unbalanced option year pricing increases the risk to the Government in payment of unreasonably high prices if the Government does not exercise all option years.  Any quote that contains unbalanced pricing will not be considered for award of this requirement.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the Government may request vendors to submit information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog prices along with any applicable discounts.  Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
678-15-1-071-0009
	1A. PROJECT/TASK #
N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$90,831.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

The total estimated cost of the requirement is $90,831.00 and consists of the following items:

1.	 GLIDESCOPE AVL SYSTEM - MOBILE STAND SETUP, PORTABLE MONITOR, COBALT 3-4 VIDEO BATON - INCLUDES OPERATION & SERVICE MANUAL      QTY: 8  UNIT PRICE:   $10,051.00

2.	STYLE GUIDE (PRE-SHAPED).  10 PER PACK    QTY: 8   UNIT PRICE: $272.00

3.	AVL 3-4 BATON     QTY: 2    UNIT PRICE  $4,122.50
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

This requirement seeks to procure additional products to complement existing materials currently being used. Tucson VA is currently using Verathon Glidescope AVL System extensively throughout the facility. This procurement action seeks to increase volume to reach compliance of recent mandate regarding Emergency Airway devices.

4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  

Verathon is the only source capable of providing the Glidescope AVL because it is manufactured exclusively by Verathon and there are no known distributors for this product. NAC personnel acknowledges that an FSS vehicle is being developed offering this item, but states it is possibly weeks away from completion.

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market Research from sources such as GSA Advantage, VA NAC Contract Catalog Search Tool, FPDS, Contract Directory, Google and VISTA found support that there have not been, nor are there currently, sources other than Verathon Inc., that can provide the required AVL for SAVAHCS.

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> I. CONTRACT INFORMATION: These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6 and supplements thereto. Services of a qualified firm are sought to provide Photogrammetric and LiDAR Surveying and Mapping. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications to accomplish the required work. The firm's team must have a Certified Photogrammetrist or a Professional Licensed Surveyor. The Government intends to negotiate and award up to four indefinite delivery restricted contracts within one year after the required response date to this solicitation.  In addition, the Government intends to award six additional unrestricted contracts under a subsequent announcement.  If there are not enough most highly qualified small business contractors to fill any or all of the restricted contracts, the remaining capacity will be shifted to unrestricted contracts.  Furthermore, those most highly qualified small businesses that do not receive an award under this restricted solicitation will have their SF 330s automatically added to the unrestricted solicitation SF 330 responses.   This solicitation does not supersede contracts previously awarded for similar work by other Corps Districts.  However, a contractor awarded a contract under this announcement will be ineligible for award under the unrestricted announcement.  Each contract will be for five years. The amount of work in each contract will not exceed $12,500,000.00 ($12.5 Million) and the guaranteed minimum will be $10,000.00.  Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract at the time of the original award.  On each individual contract, the first year's rate schedule shall become effective the day of contract award, and shall be in effect for one year from contract award. Subsequent rate schedules shall become effective on the yearly anniversary dates from contract award. Work will be issued by firm fixed price task orders not to exceed the contract amount and will be subject to successful negotiations. The District may award IDIQ contracts in the future or borrow capacity from other federal contracts to perform work that may also be encompassed by this announcement. The Contracting Officer will consider the following and other relevant factors in deciding which Contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: performance and quality of deliverables under the current contract, current capacity to accomplish the task order in the required time, and uniquely specialized experience. The contracts will be for requirements within the Continental United States and outside the Continental United States (CONUS and OCONUS).   This contract is set aside for small business only.

Ombudsman Notice

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Devore Aviation Corporation of America as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following parts:</p>

Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>

<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-78 effective 26 December 2014 which incorporates FAC 2005-79 effective 15 December, 2014.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a competitive basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) as listed on the "Requirements" attachment. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET "REQUIREMENTS-HSCG38-15-Q-200064" FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.</p>
<p>Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems. Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) H-65 aircraft.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance (COC) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>

Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>The Regional Contracting Office - National Capital Region, located at the Quantico Virginia, has a requirement for Fire Fighting Bunker Gear as follows: <br />(1) Proximity helmet; 26 each; (2) Proximity Boots; 20 each; (3) Aluminum Coats; 5 each; (4) Aluminum pants, 4 each; (5) Proximity gloves, 12 each)<br />This is a brand name or equal, competitive acquisition that is set aside for small business. Offerors proposing an equal product must provide specifications demonstrating how the product is equal.</p>
<p>All contractors must comply with the requirement listed above for this request. Failure to comply may result in disqualification. This will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2. Technical tradeoff will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose quote conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representation and certifications, and other information required by this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of requirements, contract terms and conditions, or an unrealistically high or low price when compared to Government estimates, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the program.<br /><br />Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all quotes. Only those quotes determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the quotes will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price and technical acceptability. Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced quote meeting the acceptability standards for the non-priced factors.<br /><br />TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARD:<br /><br />The contractor shall address the following two factors:<br />1. Factor 1 - Technical Capability - Offeror shall clearly demonstrate its approach to technical ability to meet the requirements of CLIN/Line Items based on meeting the requirements of the Request for Quote, quantity, quality and timeliness of delivery.<br /><br />2. Factor 2 - Price - The offeror shall complete CLIN pricing on page one (1) of this solicitation. In addition to the completed CLIN pricing on page one (1), the offeror shall provide sufficient price information to allow the contracting officer to determine the completeness and reasonableness of the offerors prices.<br />DISCUSSIONS: If during the evaluation period it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, Offeror responses to clarifications/discussion notices will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br /><br />AWARD DECISION: The award decisions will be made as follows:<br />(1) Step One - Determine Technical Acceptability. The technical evaluation, Factor 1, stated above, will assess the offerors capability to satisfy the Government's requirement. The Government will evaluate all technical capability quotes received by the required date/time. The Technical Capability factor will receive a rating of acceptable and unacceptable.

<p>PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance rating of "Sufficient Past Performance" or "Limited Past Performance". Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When determining recency, relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, and the ability of contractor to meet customer needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>b.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal quoter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quoters with no relevant past or present performance history or the quoter's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an "Unknown Past Performance" rating.</p>

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR UNINTERRUPTED POWER SUPPLY (UPS) SYSTEMS. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. <p> The purpose of this amendment is to post additional Questions and Answers and update an answer to Question No. 5. <p> The due date for receipt of offers has been extended to February 9, 2015. <p> Question No. 5: Can we offer a comparable brand battery versus the Enersys brand currently installed? <p> Answer to Question No. 5: As stated in Solicitation No. NNJ15524734R, This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the following items or their equivalent. <p> Question No. 22. Please explain why an OEM Emerson Liebert approved battery can't be quoted? <p> Answer to Question No. 22: As stated in Solicitation No. NNJ15524734R, This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the following items or their equivalent. <p> Question No 23. Please explain how quoting a battery other than the HX505 would void a warranty? <p> Answer to Question No. 23: As stated in Solicitation No. NNJ15524734R, This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the following items or their equivalent. <p> Question No 24. Please explain what kind of warranty is in place? (note: the standard UPS warranty is 1 year, UPS batteries need to be replaced every 3-5 years) <p> Answer to Question No. 24: Theres no warranty currently in-place, however there is a maintenance contract supporting system failures and warranty replacement of components. <p> Question No 25. What kind of warranty could possibly extend past the life of any VRLA UPS battery? <p> Answer to Question No. 25: None that we are aware of. <p> Question No 26. Please explain why an "or equal" battery will not be accepted? <p> Answer to Question No. 26: As stated in Solicitation No. NNJ15524734R, This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the following items or their equivalent. <p> Question No 27. Why would a battery that is the same physical dimension, same amp hours, and the same warranty not be considered? <p> Answer to Question No. 27: As stated in Solicitation No. NNJ15524734R, This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the following items or their equivalent. Question No <P> 28.

Does each Battery cabinet have its own or multiple breaker(s) which will allow for that cabinet to be taken off-line. <p> Answer to Question No. 29: Yes, each string can be taken offline. <p> Question No 30. Since there is a concern of loss of power, it is recommended to fully charge new batteries prior to putting a load on them, which would occur possibly the day after installation in case of a power failure. Is the agency willing to accept that risk? <p> Answer to Question No. 30: Historically, the supplier has provided installation plans or a Statement of Work, which allowed for continuous UPS protection, mitigating risks. <p> Question No. 31. Does the offeror need to complete the Standard Form 1449s or is it acceptable to acknowledge receipt of the original SOW and subsequent amendments in our proposal? <p> Answer to Question No. 31: Although an SF-1449 is not required for an offeror to submit a proposal, it is highly encouraged. <p> Question No. 32. Does the offeror need to complete the Reps & Certs or can we acknowledge that our Reps & Certs are current in SAM? <p> Answer to Question No. 32: In an effort not to delay contract award, it is highly recommended to have Reps & Certs completed and current in SAM. <p> The due date for receipt of offers has been extended to February 9, 2015.

The Government will not block, chock, brace, lash, band, or in any other manner secure the cargo on such conveyance(s) furnished by the Contractor.   <br>      (b)  The Contractor shall remove the property at his expense within the period of time allowed in the solicitation. If the Contracting Officer determines that the failure to remove the property within the period of time originally allowed arose out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, such determination shall be put in writing, and a reasonable extension of time for removal shall be allowed. Such causes may include, but are not restricted to, acts of God or of the public enemy, acts of the Government in its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, and severe weather.

DEFAULT.   <br>  If, after the award, the Contractor breaches the contract by failure to make payment with the time allowed by the contract as required by Condition No. 4 & 6, or by failure to remove the property as required by Condition No. 8, then the Government may send the Contractor a fifteen (15) calendar day written notice of default (calculated from date of mailing), and upon Contractor's failure to cure such default within that period , the Contractor shall lose all right, title, and interest which he might otherwise have acquired in and to such property as to which a default has occurred. The Contractor agrees that in the event he fails to pay for the property or remove the same within the prescribed period(s) of time, the Government shall be entitled to retain (or collect) as liquidated damages a sum equal to the balance of the contract.  If the Contractor otherwise fails in the performance of his obligations, the Government may exercise such rights and may pursue such remedies as are provided by law or under the contract.   <br>    <br>  If property is not paid for and removed within the allotted time, the buyer will be in default and shall lose all right, title, and interest in the property.  Buyers are cautioned to give a proposal only on the items prepared to pay for and remove in accordance with the terms and conditions of this sale.  All items awarded to the high proposal are contractually the buyer's and must be paid for and removed within the time period allowed by this solicitation. Failure to do so shall subject the buyer to paying a default fee and debarment from future Government sales.   <br>    <br>  10. SETOFF OF REFUNDS.   <br>  The buyer or Contractor agrees that the selling agency may use all or a portion of any deposit or refund due him to satisfy, in whole or in part, any debt arising out of prior transactions with the Government.   <br>    <br>  11. INTEREST.   <br>  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, unless paid within 30 calendar days from the date of first written demand, all amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest at the rate which has been established by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in Section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), from the date of first written demand until paid.   <br>    <br>    <br>  12. WEIGHING, SWITCHING, AND SPOTTING.   <br>  Where weighing is necessary to determine the exact purchase price, the Contractor shall arrange for and pay all expenses of weighing the property.  When removal is by truck, weighing shall be under the supervision of the Government and at its option on: (a) Government scales, (b) certified scales, or (c) other scales acceptable to both parties. When removal is by rail, weighing shall be on railroad track scales, or by other means acceptable to the railroad for freight purposes.  Note:  Removal is to be by truck and Contractor is to have the brass weighed on certified scales with the weight tickets provided to the Government as verification of weight.  <br>    <br>    <br>  13. LIMITATION ON GOVERNMENT'S LIABILITY.   <br>  Except for reasonable packing, loading, and transportation costs (such as packing, loading, and transportation costs being recoverable only when a return of property at Government cost is specifically authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) the measure of the Government's liability in any case where liability of the Government to the Contractor has been established shall not exceed refund of such portion of the purchase price as the Government may have received.   <br>    <br>  14. ORAL STATEMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS.   <br>  Any oral statement or representation by any representative of the Government, changing or supplementing the solicitation or contract or any Condition thereof, is unauthorized and shall confer no right upon the Buyer or Contractor.

By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign or comply with internal confidentiality agreements or statements  <br>  prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or contactors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.  <br>    <br>  24.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows: <br />STATEMENT OF NEED (SON)<br />DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)<br />NATIONAL OCEANIC ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA)<br />EARTH SYSTEM RESEARCH LABORATORY (ESRL)<br />GLOBAL MONITORING DIVISION (GMD)</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br />NOAA ESRL GMD Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases group maintains the CO2 standard scale used by the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) program, and they accurately propagate the scale in cylinders of natural air to other international participants in GAW. This vital international role insures that small spatial differences in atmospheric CO2 measured by international programs are real, and not an artifact of standards used. The calibration load is heavy; in 2014, 1377 calibrations were done. Each must be accurate, precise, and completed relatively quickly. During the past 10 years, developments in measurement technology allow improved precision and shorter analysis times, but they require that reasonably accurate measurements of &delta;13C and &delta;18O in CO2 accompany each calibration of CO2 abundance in standards. The current need has been met by an Aerodyne Research, Inc. brand analyzer, Inc. to meet that need.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: <br />As part of our responsibility as World Meteorological Organization, Central Calibration Laboratory for CO2, NOAA ESRL GMD needs a robust optical spectrometer that will accurately and precisely measure &delta;13C and &delta;18O in CO2 to &lt;0.05&permil; with 10 second averaging time.</p>
<p>If your requirement is a Brand Comparable to the Aerodyne Research, Inc. brands, please provide full specifications justifying the comparability of the brand offered.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.          <br>                <br>        The purpose of this Request for Quotation (RFQ) is to evaluate the existing tank level indicating system and make upgrades to the Control Room monitoring equipment, while making the optimum use of the existing system equipment, namely the in tank equipment.  It is intended to eliminate the Control Room meters and the need for calibration as well as to maximize the alarm functionality.          <br>                <br>        The existing Tank Level Indication system consists of all of the equipment necessary to monitor 30 individual tanks aboard the Dredge MCFARLAND.  All of the in-tank equipment are Gems Sensors.        <br>                <br>        The Control Room equipment consists of two-(2) panels of 15 meters each.  Each panel is (Height-32.25 quote mark  X Width-24.5 quote mark  X Depth-13 quote mark ).  Each meter has a low level alarm light and a high level alarm light.  Each panel has an integrated audible alarm to sound in conjunction with any of those thirty-(30) alarm situations (60 alarm situations when considering both panels). Each panel has an alarm audible acknowledge button to clear whatever audible alarm condition is present.        <br>                <br>        Vendors responding should be prepared to provide a solution to the specified areas:        <br>                <br>                <br>         	 Automated, real time indication of contents of all thirty-(30) tanks    simultaneously displayed on Control Room screen/screens in the same location as that vacated by existing meter panels.         <br>         	High and Low level alarm functions for each tank.        <br>         	Audible and visual alarm annunciation, clearly indicating alarm situation and tank involved.        <br>         	Ability to acknowledge audible and visual alarms separately, but if the alarm condition self clears, the audible and visual alarm will not clear until acknowledged.          <br>         	Ability to program and set alarm time delay, individually for each tank so as to account for nuisance tripping during swash conditions around alarm set point.        <br>         	System components should be industry standard, as 'commercial off the shelf' as possible in order to increase maintainability of the system.  Replacement components should be easily obtainable.        <br>         	After Contract award and completion of system installation all plans, drawings, operating manuals and component cut sheets shall be deliverables of the Contract.  Three-(3) copies of each shall be furnished.        <br>         	List of recommended spare parts should accompany Design documentation.        <br>         	System shall be fully tested to the satisfaction of the Government (Due to the fact that entry into the tanks will not be available, the Government will accept +/- 5% as compared to current tank soundings).  Ship's force can assist in transferring tank contents to facilitate testing, but other testing (alarm features) may require the Contractor to simulate conditions in order to verify proper system operation.        <br>         	Provisions for training the Ship's crew in all aspects of System operation & programming, to include troubleshooting for repair, shall be provided as part of Contract Award.        <br>

<p>CLIN 0001 - ISR Training, 1st Iteration<br /><br />CLIN 0002 - ISR Training, 2nd Iteration<br /><br />Statement of Work<br /><br />1. Scope: 3d Marine Special Operations Support Battalion (3D MSOSB) trains and prepares Marine Special Operations Support Teams (MSOST) for deployments with Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) companies and teams. During FY 15, 3D MSOSB will conduct training for MSOST Kilo and Lima. MSOST Kilo and Lima will participate in 3D MSOSB's led Team Readiness Exercise (TRX), which is the culminating event prior to change of operational control to 3d Marine Special Operations Battalion. TRX is 3D MSOSB Commander's opportunity to evaluate the MSOST in their ability to provide fused, multi-disciplinary intelligence, communications, and logistics support to their future MSOC Commanders and MSOTs.</p>
<p>2. Purpose: The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to define the need for a reliable and flexible Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform for ISR Tactical Controller evaluation training and special collection during the FY 15 TRXs. ISR Tactical Controller training is critical to prepare the Marines of the Direct Support Team (DST) to deploy and support full spectrum intelligence operations and special operations missions. ISR is also essential in supporting multi-disciplined intelligence training. ISR mission planning and coordination is a crucial part of the team's ability to plan and direct intelligence operations of the DST.</p>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study and develop preliminary designs and implementation requirements for the construction of a data center for the State of Amazonas in Brazil (the "host  country").</p>
<p>The Centro de Processamento de Dados do Estado de Amazonas ("PRODAM") is a private corporation with controlling interest owned by the State of Amazonas, and is linked administratively with the Secretariat for Planning and Economic Development (SEPLAN).  PRODAM has been in operation since 1972, providing specialized information technology services to government entities at municipal, state and federal levels, as well as to some private companies.  In its forty years of operation, PRODAM has continually sought to improve and refine its management processes and standards according to its guiding values of competence, credibility and a pioneering spirit.</p>
<p>PRODAM seeks to build on its successes in applying information technology for public administration and to continue to expand the state's capabilities in this area.  One central investment in the PRODAM strategy will be a new government data center that will host public sector applications, facilitate management of government networks, and serve backup and disaster recovery functions for data and applications maintained by disparate government agencies.  The fundamental design requirements for the data center will be determined by projections of the expected useful life of the infrastructure, the desired future capabilities of the state, and planning for contingencies.  As a result, effective planning for the data center will be rooted in the over-arching strategy of Amazonas state, the strategies of disparate Amazonas state agencies, and best efforts to predict future scenarios for the state and technology evolution.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $578,995 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

<DESC><strong>REVISED CLOIS SOLICITATION INFORMATION</strong><br />The following paragraphs provide the latest status of the CLOIS acquisition. This information is provided in advance of Final RFP release to allow as much time as possible to consider any changed information from previously published notices.
<p><strong>SOLICITATION ISSUANCE AND PROPOSAL SUBMISSION<br /></strong>The official Request for Proposal for CLOIS will be posted to FBO on 11 FEB 15. Proposal closing date will be 26 MAR 15. All solicitation documents will be uploaded in final form on 11 Feb 15. Documents which were under restricted access during draft stages will also be restricted when posted as part of the final solicitation. Bidder's library documents will not be reposted as they are informational only. The library located on FBO will remain accessible throughout the proposal process.</p>
<p><strong>PERFORMANCE PERIOD UPDATE</strong><br />Throughout the draft RFP stages, the CLOIS team has attempted to provide as much information to industry as soon as it could be released in order to allow you maximum time to prepare for final RFP release. Last week, we posted an update to the performance period of the acquisition in response to your questions. Although the information was current at that time, circumstances have changed and the timeline has been revised. In addition to reducing the proposal submission time from 45 days to 42 days, the final RFP posted on 11 Feb 15, will also contain contract start date and performance period changes. Contract transition is scheduled for 1 Sep through 30 Nov 15 with full performance on 1 Dec 15. The Government team realizes this is a very aggressive schedule and will do everything possible to answer questions and resolve any issues as quickly as possible. Changes to the performance period will be reflected in the solicitation and the Total Evaluated Price Worksheet.</p>
<p><strong>REQUEST FOR EARLY SUBMISSION OF CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITY DOCUMENTATION</strong> <br />When the final RFP is released you will notice the majority of documents mirror those posted in draft format. Some will have changes prompted by your questions. The final solicitation document contains a new requirement to provide a copy of your proposal to your cognizant DCAA at the time you submit the proposal to us. Additionally, in order to allow any needed pre-award surveys to proceed as early as possible, the RFP will request early submission of the information requested under the Contractor Responsibility paragraph. The final RFP will contain a change in Section L paragraph 1.2.1 and will read as follows:</p>
<p>1.2.1. Submission: All volumes, paper and electronic, shall be delivered to 45 CONS/LGCZR, Attn: Kathy Jackson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 1201 Edward H. White St. Patrick AFB, FL 32925, Building 423, Room N204 no later than 1:00 PM local time 26 Mar 2015. Concurrent with submission of the documents required in Table 1.3, the offeror shall provide one complete proposal package to their DCAA auditor for use in a pre-award survey. Additionally, the Government requests early submission of the information requested in paragraph 4.1.2.3. Contractor Responsibility Information no later than 1:00 PM local time 25 FEB 15 to permit early determination of pre-award survey needs.</p>
<p>The Section L paragraph which provides instructions for submission of Contractor responsibility information has been further clarified and will read as follows:</p>
<p>4.1.2.3. Contractor Responsibility Information: Provide a listing of contracts performed by the prime contractor within the last three years. For each contract, include contract number, title, whether you were the prime contractor or subcontractor, contract amount and point of contact (email and phone number) for the Contracting Officer or Program Manager. For contracts performed as a subcontractor, provide point of contact information for the prime contractor. For offerors proposing as a Joint Venture (JV), include the contract number, title, whether the contract was performed by the same JV or a single partner, contract amount and Contracting Officer or Program Manager point of contact (email and phone number) for each. Provide a copy of the prime contractor financial statements for the last three completed fiscal years. For offerors proposing as a JV, provide a copy of the JV agreement identifying the financial structure and financial statements for the last three completed fiscal years. If the JV does not have financial statements for three completed fiscal years, provide the information of each JV partner. The Government may collect additional information from additional sources to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System, Electronic Subcontract Reporting System, or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers and Fee Determining Officials; the Defense Contract Management Agency, and commercial sources. See Paragraph 1.2.1 requesting early submission of the information requested in this paragraph.</p>
<p>Factor 2, Technical Risk will require additional information than previously stated in the draft version. The factor has a new paragraph number and will read as follows:</p>
<p>2.2. Factor 2 - Technical Risk Specific Instructions</p>
<p>Technical risk will be assessed for each Technical Capability subfactor. As a part of each Technical Capability subfactor, the offeror shall address any Technical Risk associated with those aspects of your proposed technical approach you consider to have the potential for disruption of schedule, increased costs, degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. Classify each risk in accordance with Section M, Table 2.2, Technical Risk Rating. Provide the rationale for each risk and its rating, including quantitative estimates of the impact on cost, schedule, and performance. Describe the impact of each identified risk in terms of its potential to interfere with or prevent the successful accomplishment of other contract requirements. Propose a realistic "work around" or risk mitigators for identified risks that will eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level. Identify and classify any new risks introduced by such risk mitigation.</p>
<p><strong>FINAL SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS vs DRAFT DOCUMENTS</strong><br />Offerors are reminded that the final documents posted on 11 Feb 15 must be used in preparing the proposal. Highlighting the Section L paragraph changes in this notice is not intended to relieve the offeror from reviewing the final documents and does not indicate that other documents are identical to the draft. Final documents do have some changes from the drafts. It is the offeror's responsibility to review final documents for proposal preparation.</p>

NIST does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice, or otherwise pay for the information requested. No entitlement or payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by NIST will arise as a result of submission of responses to this Notice and NIST use of such information.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) is seeking information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing Service Desk and Desktop Support Services.</p>
<p>The mission of the Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) is to strengthen the research programs at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through the effective, efficient and secure utilization of Information Technology (IT).</p>
<p>The Customer Access and Support Division (CASD), located in Boulder, Colorado and Gaithersburg, Maryland is the customer facing, single point of contact between OISM IT service providers and end users/customers on a day-to-day basis. CASD serves as a center of excellence to ensure service management best practices are leveraged across OISM and has adopted the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) Service Management framework for the delivery of information technology services.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking contractor professional services in support of its Service Desk and Desktop Support services. The Service Desk and Desktop Support Services are being performed as separate contracts that were awarded to a small business. It was determined to consolidate them due to the fact that the services are integrally related. See attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Period of Performance:</p>
<p>The Period of Performance is for Base Year and 4 one-year option periods Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with the option to extend services not to exceed six (6) months.</p>
<p>Market Research<br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may consider or conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award to small business socioeconomic programs (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB programs or as a total small business set-aside. A determination by the Government to proceed with the acquisition as a set-aside is within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>Companies with the capability to meet the requirements as described in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) may email a detailed response describing their capabilities to fulfil this requirement to abdul-kudus.yahaya@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The following information is required to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>

The name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a technical point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.</p>
<p>2. Describe experience providing services similar to the attached draft PWS.</p>
<p>3. Provide evidence of three contract experiences (for which you were the prime and not the subcontractor) of ongoing and/or former contracts, started or completed within the past three years that are similar in scope and equivalent in function to the work to be performed under the proposed contract as described in the attached draft PWS. For each experience, include: <br />&bull; the name and address of the client for whom the work was performed, <br />&bull; statement that you were the prime not subcontractor,<br />&bull; the general nature and scope of the work, <br />&bull; the period during which the work was performed, <br />&bull; the dollar value of the project, <br />&bull; the name and telephone number of the COR (or equivalent) who is knowledgeable about the vendor's performance on the project.</p>

<p>5. Provide evidence of corporate certifications including CMMI or ISO. At least one of these certifications is preferred." One or both certifications are desired by NIST because:</p>
<p>A. CMMI has a model CMMI for Services, which is designed for businesses that focus on establishing, managing, and delivering services. <br /><br />B.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR HQ), in support of the Naval Sea Systems Command, Program Executive Office, Submarines, Maritime Surveillance Systems Program Office, PMS 485, intends to issue a Full and Open Competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for the development of Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) passive acoustic linear arrays. Based on market research, the Government determined that there were no small businesses capable of producing the required arrays within the required time frame.
The SWSS arrays are surveillance sensors used as the primary sensing capability for SWSS units which are physically attached to the arrays.  Each SWSS unit is a stand-alone, battery powered system which will collect, process, analyze the data from the array and transmit undersea contact locating information to operational commanders.  They are designed to support the Navy's littoral undersea surveillance needs in detecting and reporting submarines.  Each SWSS array comprises the following sub-assemblies: one acoustic array (to include its leader cable and terminating connector); one array interface card (physically located inside the SWSS node bottle which includes its necessary connectors and bulkhead connector), and one array dispenser.
The proposed contract will be a single award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with an ordering period of five years that will allow for the development and production of a maximum of 75 SWSS passive acoustic linear arrays.  The development and production effort will be procured on a Firm- Fixed-Price (FFP) basis.
A Sources Sought, SPAWAR Headquarters MKTSVY F1ADA dated 24 June 2014, was issued for market research purposes to determine the interest and capability of Small Business to participate in this acquisition.  Of the four responses to the Sources Sought, three were from small businesses and one was from a non-profit organization.  The Government's analysis of the Sources Sought responses indicated that none of the four were capable of producing the required arrays within the required time frame.  Therefore, it was recommended that the SWSS Array RFP be issued as a Full and Open Competitive solicitation.  The SPAWAR Small Business Office and the Small Business Administration Representative reviewed the Sources Sought analysis and concurred with the decision not to set-aside this effort.
Responses to this announcement should be addressed to James Leal at James.Leal@navy.mil. Companies interested in this RFP should monitor the FedBizOpps.com website for the release of this solicitation.
*********************UPDATE 11-17-14************************* Posted all questions & answers received to date regarding this pre-solicitation synopsis (see attachment). Also, updated the projected bid due date until 1/30/15 (this is just an estimate).
