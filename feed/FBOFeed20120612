<CONTACT>Jerry L. Hodson, 7195262156

<a href="mailto:jerry.l.hodson.civ@mail.mil">MICC - Fort Carson</a>
<DESC>The shoot house layout shall include a minimum net space of 1,748 square foot (46' x 38'). The system shall be deployable (non-permanent) and reconfigurable, shall not require specialty tools or equipment for installation or repair (like a welding trailer or crane), and shall withstand extreme live firing and harsh environmental conditions. The shoot house shall have a mixture of 16 corner-fed and center-fed interior doors and shall have seven (7) rooms and one (1) "X" intersection hallway. All walls shall be a minimum of 8' high and fabricated with minimum of 3/8 inch steel plate with a 500 Brinell hardness. Wall and door panels shall have a 2 inch thick rubber panel, adhered in accordance with manufacturer specifications. All panels shall be free of cracks, tears, holes, defects, and shall reduce ricochet, splatter, and airborne lead. Shoot house systems with wood components in the design, other than the 18 non-siding interior doors, shall be considered technically unacceptable for this requirement.<br>The exterior and interior ballistic walls shall be designed to stop and contain rounds (to prevent splatter and shoot-through) and minimize ricochets. Bullet absorbing walls shall be replaceable and repairable. Separate bullet traps shall be used behind targets to reduce the number of rounds impacting the walls.<br>The shoot house shall have three (3) external, sliding ballistic entrances/exits constructed of 3/8" AR500 and the inner facing side shall be covered with ballistic rubber and installed on sliding trolley systems including all associated structural components. Exterior doors shall be 78" tall by 36" wide.<br>The shoot house shall have nine (9), interior sliding ballistic doors/corridor sections constructed of 3/8" AR500 and covered with ballistic rubber and installed on sliding trolley systems including associated structural components. Two inch (2") ballistic rubber is adhered on both sides of all interior walls, doors, and sliding interior doors within the structure.<br>The shoot house shall have (18) non-sliding interior door frames that shall be constructed with wood and rubber panels and shall be hung with metal door hinges that shall be countersunk into the wood frame to prevent a ricochet hazard. Interior doors shall accommodate standard lock and hardware with quick service resets (slide-in lock, handle, and bolt sections). Interior doors shall be 78" tall by 30" wide. See floor plan drawing for door locations.<br>The shoot house shall have two (2) exterior breech holes (windows) along with sliding ballistic opening coverings constructed of 3/8" AR500 and the inner facing side shall be covered with ballistic rubber. These exterior breech holes coverings shall be installed on sliding trolley systems including all associated structural components. One (1) exterior window shall be 24" by 36" and the other shall be 34" x 62". The successful Offeror can decide which size window is installed at the designated locations as indicated on the drawing. See floor plan drawing for window locations.<br>The elevated observation control platform (EOCP) enhances the ability to observe and control Live Fire Shoot House (LFSH) operations. EOCPs shall be constructed to:<br>(a) Maximize instructors' observation and control of the entry team fire and movement;<br>(b) Facilitate communication between instructors on the EOCP and the floor;<br>(c) Position the lowest point of the horizontal walking surface higher than the 15  vertical error for any target engaged;<br>(d) Provide ready access;<br>(e) Integrate instructors' movement with team flow;<br>(f) Maximize instructors' ability to see shooters clearly at all times;<br>(g) Have supporting structures placed so that they pose no additional hazards such as tripping, ricochet, splatter, etc.<br>A component of the catwalk railings is the "Ballistic Plexiglas Protection" sidewall protection with a minimum height of 36" tall and 1/2" thick. The "Ballistic Plexiglas Protection" need not be rated to even level 1 ballistic. The Offeror shall determine a suitable method to install the "Ballistic Plexiglas Protection" as it is only one component of the catwalk (elevated observation control platform). This prevention measure is primarily to mitigate the effects of a ricochet or wood/metal fragments caused by explosive breach to the doors. Additionally, the "Ballistic Plexiglas Protection" is a means to prevent observer/controllers from being injured by errant training personnel suppression devices (flash-bangs).<br>Offers shall provide past performance information including points of contact and phone numbers. Ballistic testing, (either conducted by the United States Army, the United States Special Operations Command, or an independent third party), shall be provided with proposals on shoot house systems being offered.<br>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for a Tip Clearance Calibration Rig System .  To ensure safe operation, the Turbomachinery Test Facilities at NASA Glenn require that the clearance between the tip of each fan, compressor, or turbine blade being tested and its surrounding casing be measured and displayed on a continuous basis during testing. In order to ensure that the clearance being measured is accurate, each tip clearance measurement system must be calibrated prior to the start of testing. The most desirable method is to have a separate tip clearance system calibration rig where a dummy disk with blade profiles matching those of the test hardware is used to calibrate each tip clearance measurement system prior to the start of testing. The required Tip Clearance Calibration Rig shall be portable, self-contained and include a variable speed electric drive motor, spindle and any necessary cooling and lubrication subsystems. NASA/GRC intends to purchase this item from Setco Sales Company for their off-the-shelf system meets all requirements and will eliminate development time and allow this time critical hardware to be available to support the Turbomachinery Test Facilities. Although other component manufacturers were able to provide component specifications, none had integrated the component into a system that could be used for our testing purposes. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 19, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC><p><strong>Introduction:<br /><br /></strong>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from ballistic missile attack.&nbsp; Please review the Ballistic Missile Defense Review (http://www.defense.gov/bmdr/) for details.&nbsp; The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, directed energy systems, interceptors, and command and control elements to engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from boost and early intercept phases through midcourse into terminal phase.&nbsp; MDA focuses efforts toward making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to counter a broad range of missiles, warheads and trajectories.&nbsp; The BMDS must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>MDA instituted the Missile Defense Agency Science and Technology Advanced Research (MSTAR) program to fund relevant Advanced Technology research and demonstration work at qualified accredited domestic colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning and to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.&nbsp; Proposals must be for Advanced Research.&nbsp; This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is a recurring, competitive solicitation and contract vehicle enabling MDA to identify and acquire emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability and filling technology gaps.</p>
<p>MDA issues this BAA under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.&nbsp; Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA meet requirements for full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."<br /><br />Any activity conducted on or resulting from funding on contracts awarded from this BAA must comply with United States Laws and regulations on "Export Control", including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Export Administration Regulation (EAR).&nbsp; All technical documents produced on the contract shall be marked in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5230.24, unless the document is specifically approved by MDA for public release.&nbsp; The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will provide the appropriate 5230.24 distribution statement.<br /><br /><strong>General Information:<br /></strong><br />MDA will review information regarding research conducted under MDA funded actions for possible publication or presentation in open or ITAR-controlled forums.&nbsp; Information regarding classified research shall not be published or presented in any unclassified forum.&nbsp; MDA has final authority on publication or release of any information related to research MDA funds, classified or unclassified, in any forum.<br /><br />Only domestic accredited colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning registered by the U.S. Department of Education may submit proposals.&nbsp; Federal educational organizations such as the U.S. military academies must use a different application process; please contact the Technical Point of Contact (POC) listed below for details regarding Federal educational organizations.&nbsp; If selected for contract award resulting from this BAA, the offeror must be a qualified education institution at time of award.&nbsp; If a white paper is based on a subcontract or teaming arrangement, the college, university or educational institution submitting the proposal must lead the effort and perform more than 50 percent of the effort by cost.&nbsp; <br /><br />All contract awards are subject to official fiscal appropriation and availability of funds.&nbsp; For planning purposes, firm-fixed-price or cost reimbursement type contracts, cooperative agreements or grants are anticipated to be awarded for these efforts unless otherwise identified.&nbsp; We anticipate each MSTAR contract's funding at a maximum of $500,000 (two year period of performance) or $700,000 (three year period of performance). Funding ceilings are $250,000 a year during a two year base period of performance with a potential option for a third year of performance funded at a maximum of $200,000.&nbsp; Inclusion of options in any contract is at the discretion of the government.&nbsp; The government is also not obligated to exercise any option period included in an awarded contract.<br /><br />MDA requires all lead Principal Investigators of institutions submitting a proposal under this program hold US citizenship.&nbsp; MDA desires all participating students conducting research for contracts sponsored under this program award, to hold US citizenship.&nbsp; In addition, the government reserves the right to request special justification for considering any student who is a non-US citizen, including but not limited to individuals that obtain a valid Permanent Resident Card, commonly called a "Green Card", for participation in research for contracts sponsored through this program award. Foreign citizen students without valid Green Cards are ineligible for consideration and participation.</p>
<p>If MDA decides to pursue a proposal, the MDA Contracting Officer will request a written final proposal.&nbsp; Universities contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Richard Schwarz (MDA/DVR; 256-450-4366) to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources preparing a proposal in response to this BAA.&nbsp; Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle.&nbsp; Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and government time spent on efforts unlikely to receive a contract.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and through the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) created the Perinatology Research Branch (PRB) in response to Sec. 452B of the Public Health Service Act that was passed by Congress and signed into law by the President as part of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993. Section 452B states that: "The Director of the Institute (NICHD) shall establish, and maintain within the Institute, an intramural laboratory and clinical research program in obstetrics and gynecology." For a number of years, Congress has expressed concern over the unacceptably high infant mortality rate throughout the United States. In order to effectively and efficiently address the perinatal aspects of this problem, the NICHD must establish the PRB in a location that has access to the patient population and research infrastructure necessary to accomplish the goals of the Branch. The NICHD has determined that the most effective approach is to locate the PRB within an academic institution that serves a large obstetrical and neonatal patient population. </span></p>
<p>The mission of the PRB/Program in Perinatal Research and Obstetrics (PPRO) is to conduct clinical and laboratory research in maternal, fetal, and neonatal diseases responsible for perinatal morbidity and mortality; and to train health care professionals in perinatal medicine and related disciplines. The PRB/PPRO emphasizes a multi-disciplinary approach and utilizes expertise from clinical disciplines (obstetrics, neonatology, perinatal pathology), basic sciences (molecular and developmental biology, biochemistry, physiology, etc.), and clinical epidemiology to improve the etiologic understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disorders related to maternal and infant mortality.</p>
<p>The PRB/PPRO currently has, or is developing, research protocols addressing the following areas:</p>
<p>1. The role of inflammation and other mechanisms of disease in preterm parturition and the &lsquo;great obstetrical syndromes'. <br />2. Physical and biochemical biomarkers for the prediction of spontaneous or "indicated preterm birth" (e.g. an example of this is the use of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors to identify patients at risk for preeclampsia and other complications of pregnancy).<br />3. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions in obstetrics and perinatal medicine. <br />4. Pharmacoeconomic studies of interventions to prevent preterm birth (e.g. vaginal progesterone).<br />5. Pharmacogenomic studies to identify DNA variants that predispose to a short cervix and identify patients who respond or do not respond to vaginal progesterone administration.<br />6. Characterization of fetal growth in singleton and twin gestations using 2D and 3D ultrasound.<br />7. Use of 2D and 3D ultrasound in the labor and delivery floor to identify the patient at risk for failure to progress in labor in the first or second stage. <br />8. Application of magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate perinatal brain injury by assessing anatomy, hemodynamics and functional biochemistry.<br />9. Development of intelligent navigation to characterize normal and abnormal fetal anatomy using 3D and 4D ultrasound.<br />10. Characterization of pathologic lesions of the human placenta associated with the &lsquo;great obstetrical syndromes' (preterm labor, prelabor rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, large for gestational age, fetal death, gestational diabetes, etc.). <br />11. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the chorioamniotic membranes, myometrium and cervix in term and preterm labor, including labor disorders responsible for major morbidity.<br />12. Proteomic analysis of the amniotic fluid, maternal and umbilical cord blood to identify biomarkers for mechanisms of disease responsible for the &lsquo;great obstetrical syndromes'.<br />13. Characterization of the maternal and fetal white blood cell transcriptome in fetal systemic inflammation types I and II. <br />14. Identification and characterization of placental microRNAs involved in human labor, preterm labor, preeclampsia, small for gestational age, fetal death, preterm PROM and other obstetrical syndromes.<br />15. Longitudinal studies of the vaginal microbiome, mucosal immunity of the lower genital tract in non-pregnant women, normal pregnant women and those who have a preterm delivery with and without intra-amniotic infection. <br />16. Longitudinal studies of pregnant women to identify biomarkers for preeclampsia, SGA, LGA and fetal death. <br />17. Use of molecular microbiologic techniques to identify the endometrial flora in the non-pregnant state, and how it differs from the lower genital tract. <br />18. Further characterization of the role of microbial biofilms in ascending intrauterine infection.<br />19. The role of neuroinflammation in the genesis of cerebral palsy and other developmental disorders.<br />20. The use of nanotechnology and regenerative medicine to induce central nervous system repair and prevent the development of cerebral palsy and other neurodevelopmental disorders.<br />21. The use of molecular imaging to identify congenital neonatal neuroinflammation.<br />22. Characterization of maternal and fetal genetic factors that predispose to adverse pregnancy outcome.<br />23. A randomized clinical trial of vaginal progesterone in twin gestations in women with a short cervix.</p>

<p>Definitions</p>
<p>1. "Single Site" <br />A "single site" is defined as one hospital and, specifically, one labor and delivery suite, and not a "system", "consortium" or "group" of affiliated hospitals. This requirement is paramount to maintain efficacy of this federally funded program. Since a patient can deliver any time during a 24 hour period, it is more cost-efficient to house the program in a single site. This will avoid the need to replicate and maintain a research infrastructure (space, equipment, faculty, nursing staff and laboratory personnel) in more than one hospital. This approach will also simplify the management of the research operation.</p>
<p>Institutions with two labor and delivery suites located in different hospitals under the same name do not meet the requirement of a single site if neither of the units has a minimum of 4,500 deliveries per year. The conditions of stability and access outlined elsewhere must be met for contract performance. NICHD wishes to avoid rapidly shifting patient populations away from the site that will house the Branch. Buildings which house Branch personnel or contract personnel or to which Branch and contract personnel will need to go shall be located within a mile of the building which houses the labor delivery unit and the Administrative Offices of the Branch.</p>
<p>2. "Access to Patients" <br />The Perinatology Research Branch/PPRO is a clinical Branch with a research and training mission as well as an obligation to maintain the clinical and research skills of government appointees who are Board eligible or certified or other health care professionals pursuing training goals with the PRB/PPRO. Access to an adequate patient population is required to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>Although this solicitation is planned for the procurement of space, equipment, supplies, a workforce and other services, the success of the Perinatology Research Branch depends on the access to patients and the absence of obstacles that would render the operation inefficient. Consequently, NICHD seeks to establish this Branch in an institution with a culture supportive of clinical research in obstetrics and with experience in removing barriers and obstacles to the successful completion of research and training. Given the magnitude of the commitment by the federal government, NICHD seeks an institution capable of giving priority to research protocols of the Perinatology Research Branch/PPRO.</p>
<p>The PRB/PPRO has access to patients, biological materials, and training opportunities only if all the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>i. The patients can be invited to participate in a research protocol approved by the Perinatology Research Branch/PPRO and the hosting institution IRB without additional approval of staff physicians, private attendings, nurse midwives or other personnel. Before the implementation of a protocol, the Perinatology Research Branch will communicate with the leadership of the Departments involved, as well as representatives of the faculty and community physicians. The protocol developed by the Branch will be distributed to medical and paramedical personnel before the initiation of the study. If after information is provided and the staff is consulted, additional approval is required from individual faculty members, private physicians, nurse midwife before research staff is allowed to invite patients to participate in a study, this will be considered "qualified access". If this "case by case" approval is not required this will be considered "unqualified access". NICHD will give preference to institutions that offer "unqualified access".</p>
<p>ii. The collection of biological materials (i.e., maternal blood, umbilical cord blood, saliva, urine, amniotic fluid, maternal and neonatal urine, tracheal bronchial fluid lavage, cerebral spinal fluid, placentas, placental bed biopsy, vaginal secretions, uterine cervical fluid, endometrial biospies, etc.) required for the execution of the research agenda of the Branch will be given priority over other research protocols which compete for the same material and/or patient.</p>
<p>iii. Members of the PRB/PPRO and contract personnel in a support capacity are allowed to:<br />i. observe operative procedures in the operating room<br />ii. visit patients in the antepartum, intrapartum (Labor and Delivery) and postpartum ward<br />iii. observe invasive procedures such as chorionic villous sampling, fetal blood sampling, fetal endoscopic surgery, etc.<br />iv. observe autopsies of perinatal deaths as well as maternal deaths<br />v. access to videotapes or records of files (i.e., ultrasound records) of previously diagnosed cases of conditions which may be of interest to the Branch for research or educational purposes (e.g., congenital anomalies, placenta accreta, amniotic fluid embolism, etc.)<br />vi. access to diagnostic imaging including radiology, magnetic resonance imaging and CAT scanning<br />vii. access to the angiography suite where patients are undergoing embolization for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage or other conditions<br />viii. access to the Maternal Special Care and Intensive Care Units for research and educational purposes regarding critically ill mothers<br />ix. access to laboratories for obtaining specimens which patients may have provided to clinical hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation laboratory, immunology laboratory, microbiology laboratory <br />x. access to paraffin blocks, histologic slides/photographs of gross specimens of patients who may have delivered in the hospital and may have a condition of interest to the Branch<br />xi. access to obstetric, pediatric and pathology conferences where cases are discussed and which may represent educational or research opportunities for members of the Branch or contract support staff access to videoconference facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED<br />Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all of the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, to support the execution of the research agenda of the Perinatology Research Branch/PPRO, Division of Intramural Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.</p>
<p>As a result of the Contractor's necessity to furnish all of the services, qualified personnel, material and facilities, the Contractor shall provide evidence demonstrating they meet or exceed the following Mandatory Criteria Qualifications:</p>
<p>Mandatory Qualifications Criteria</p>
<p>1. Availability to required patient population <br />The goal of the PRB/PPRO is to study pregnancy complications leading to the excessive rate of infant morbidity and mortality. The frequency of individual pregnancy complications is low, ranging from 1 to 6% of births (i.e., preterm delivery &lt;32 weeks, severe pre-eclampsia, congenital anomalies, severe small for gestational age). Consequently, access to a large obstetric population is required to efficiently recruit during pregnancy, obtain adequate neonatal outcome and infant follow-up information on a scientifically valid number of patients within a defined period of time. Therefore, offerors must provide evidence that they have an obstetrical population delivering a minimum of 4,500 deliveries at a "single site".</p>
<p>A "single site" is defined as one hospital with one labor and delivery suite, and not a "system", "consortium" or "group" of affiliated hospitals. This requirement is paramount to maintain efficacy of this federally funded program. Since a patient can deliver any time during a 24 hour period, it is more cost-efficient to house the program at a single site. This will avoid the need to replicate and maintain a research infrastructure (space, equipment, faculty, nursing staff and laboratory personnel) in more than one hospital. This approach will also simplify the management of the research operation.</p>
<p>Institutions with two labor and delivery suites located in different hospitals under the same name do not meet the requirement of a "single site" if neither of the units has a minimum of 4,500 deliveries per year. The conditions of stability of the patient population and access to patients defined elsewhere must be met at the time of the submission of the offer, negotiations and contract administration.</p>
<p>NICHD wishes to avoid housing this Branch in an institution with a rapidly shifting patient population away from the site that will house the Branch. Buildings that house Branch personnel or Contract personnel in support of the Branch or to which Branch and Contract personnel will need to go to accomplish their goals, shall be located within a mile of the building which houses the labor delivery unit and the Administrative Offices of the Branch.</p>
<p>2. Approved residency programs in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics and Pathology<br />The conduction of clinical research in perinatology is a 24 hours per day, 7 days per week effort as labor and delivery of complicated pregnancies can rarely be scheduled. Residency programs in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics and Pathology assure around the clock staffing of basic services required to conduct clinical research. The existence of approved programs in these disciplines is also an indicator of the commitment of the institutions to a training mission, which also is a goal of the Branch.</p>
<p>3. Board approved fellowships in Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Neonatology, Reproductive Endocrinology, Human Genetics, and Pediatric Cardiology<br />An important goal of the PRB/PPRO is to train sub-specialists in disciplines related to perinatal medicine. This training must qualify fellows for sub-specialty certification by the appropriate Division of the American Board. The existence of already approved fellowship programs in these areas will obviate the need for a new application and will expedite accomplishment of the Branch's training goal. It is expected that existing programs will be expanded or modified to accommodate the needs of the Branch. If expansion is not possible, then it is required that priority will be given to clinical fellows appointed by the PRB/PPRO as government appointees. In order to justify expansion of the program and obtain Board approval, institutions must have an adequate case load and training opportunities. The presence of approved fellowship programs in Maternal Fetal Medicine, Human Genetics, Neonatalogy, Reproductive Endocrinology is evidence that an academic culture fostering training and research exists at the hosting institution. Training and research programs in Reproductive Endocrinology and Human Genetics are important because the PRB/PPRO is interested in studying complications of the first trimester of pregnancy, genetic diagnosis, fetal dysmorphology, prenatal diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases including anatomic anomalies and inborn errors of metabolism. The Branch will also focus on improving the prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease and fetal cardiovascular dysfunction, which may underlie the increased risk of growth-restricted fetuses for coronary artery disease, stroke and hypertension in adult life.</p>

<DESC>Subject to Congressional approval and appropriation of funds, the Naval Air Systems Command intends to negotiate and award a contract to Raytheon Missile Systems for the development and/or deployment of a near term Offensive Anti-Surface Weapon by integrating sensors, targeting correlation algorithms, and weapons capable radio subsystems that can be rapidly integrated into the Tactical Tomahawk Block (BLK)IV Weapons System to meet a need date of 2015 (i.e., rapid development/deployment). This effort includes procurement of component kits, test equipment, support for tests, and converting Tomahawk missiles to Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare missiles. These subsystems will add capabilities to create a semi-autonomous weapon capable of detection, discrimination and terminal guidance to a moving maritime target that will meet urgent operational needs. The integration will require specific engineering design data for the BLK IV mechanical, electrical, and functional interfaces. The systems/subsystems interfaces will include weight and balance, guidance and control, executive computer control software, and satellite data terminal, among other avionic components. <br /><br />For the purposes of this effort, NAVAIR intends to award this seeker and data-link integration effort to Raytheon, since it has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer of the BLK IV Tactical Tomahawk Missile since 1998 and solely possesses the knowledge, capability, and technical data packages for the BLK IV Tomahawk Missile. The BLK IV's operating range, in-flight command and control capability, and VLS compatibility, along with its existing Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS) and Tomahawk Command and Control System (TC2S) infrastructure, will ensure that integration and performance capability requirements can be achieved with the available resources and provide the nearest term Initial Operational Capability. This effort requires extensive knowledge of the BLK IV Tomahawk Weapon System and Raytheon is the only known source capable of accomplishing the required effort in the required timeframe and without significant duplication of cost.<br />

<a href="mailto:honegger.harold@epa.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), intends to award a purchase order to a small business in support of a Workshop on Climate Change Adaptation for Coral Reefs under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19 ? Small Business Programs approximately 15 days after the posting date of this notice.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561920 ? Convention and Trade Show Organizers.  Any small business interested in receiving an RFQ should send a request to Harold Honegger at honegger.harold@epa.gov.  A Statement of Work (SOW) for this requirement can be found below.  This is not a Request for Quote.  No RFQ is available at this time.  Questions concerning this procurement should be addressed to Harold Honegger at honegger.harold@epa.gov.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Title:  Workshop on Climate Change Adaptation for Coral Reefs 
I. Purpose
The purpose of this purchase order is to provide services to the Global Change Impacts and Adaptation (GCIA) staff in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Air, Climate and Energy Program in the Office of Research and Development, to conduct a workshop in Honolulu, Hawaii on coral reef management planning for adaptation to climate change. 
The Contractor shall provide logistical support for a 2.5- day workshop, using a workshop plan to be provided by the Technical Project Officer (TPO) in advance of the workshop. The workshop will be structured around an expert elicitation type exercise that will explore best practices for ?mainstreaming? climate change adaptation principles into coral reef management planning, with a focus on a particular case study coral reef site in the Pacific and a particular issue such as restoration planning. Participants at the workshop shall include approximately 25 experts in coral reef management, coral reef science, and climate change impacts and adaptation assessment science from across Federal agencies, states and territories, non-governmental agencies, and academia. The draft plan for the workshop and supporting background materials for the participants to receive prior to the workshops will be supplied by the TPO. The workshop will take place in Honolulu, Hawaii in the spring of  2013 (dates to be determined).  The period of performance of this purchase order shall be from date of award to September 30, 2013.
II. Background
Work by EPA?s GCIA staff involves assessments of the potential vulnerability to climate change (and other global change stressors such as land-use change) of ecosystem health, water quality, human health and air quality with a focus on developing adaptation options to build resilience in the face of these vulnerabilities. Vulnerability and adaptation assessment activities in the GCIA aquatic ecosystems focus area support EPA?s mission and responsibilities as defined by the Clean Water Act (CWA), and are designed to build the capacity of EPA programs, regional offices, aquatic ecosystem managers (including coral reef managers), and other decision-makers to assess and respond to global change impacts on ecosystem processes and services.
Multiple recent efforts across government, non-governmental organizations, and academia have advanced the dialogue on general principles for adaptation to climate change at the national scale; more recently EPA has been working with partners on a unified adaptation framework designed to be tractable and accessible for use by ecosystem managers. Case study applications of this framework, as well as other approaches being experimented with on the ground, are needed in order to demonstrate utility for specific vulnerable ecosystems. This will be the purpose of the current workshop, which will use expert elicitation to tailor and apply the latest theoretical adaptation planning principles for practical use in coral reef management. Managers and scientists from Federal agencies, states, territories, academia and non-governmental organizations will engage in a planning exercise, focusing on one or more coral reef case studies, to integrate climate change and resilience information  into planning for specific coral reef management issues such as injury mitigation and restoration. The workshop will take place in Honolulu, Hawaii in the spring of 2013.
A workshop plan for a 2.5-day expert elicitation exercise is under development by a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and will be provided to the Contractor by the TPO.
III. Scope of Work
The scope of work is to provide logistical support for a 2.5-day workshop and deliver a post-workshop report that compiles materials prepared before and during the workshop by the TSC, its rapporteurs, and by the workshop participants.
Task 1 - Establish Communications
Within 7 days of the purchase order award, the Contractor shall convene a conference call with the TPO and appropriate contractor staff to confirm task deliverables and project schedule. The Contractor shall establish regular conference calls with the TPO to discuss progress and resolve any technical difficulties. At the beginning of the project it is likely that the calls will occur monthly for no more than 0.5 hours, with a switch to weekly calls of 1 hour starting several months prior to the spring 2013 workshop. Calls may include other members of the workshop Technical Steering Committee (e.g., EPA partners from other agencies/organizations) as needed at the request of the TPO. The Contractor shall initiate additional communication with the TPO should developments arise that may affect the schedule of this task order or any of the task deliverables outlined therein.

Task 2 ? Pre-workshop support
Pre-workshop support from the Contractor shall include, in consultation with the TPO: selecting and reserving a workshop venue; developing a participant list; selecting and sending invitation materials to participants; compensating non-Federal workshop participants for travel; and sending background materials (workshop exercise-specific materials to be provided by the TPO) to the workshop participants in advance of the workshop. All materials and communications will be electronic. 
A draft of the workshop exercise plan will be provided by the TPO to the Contractor after award of the contract; the current estimate for availability of the draft plan is January 2013.
A. Secure workshop facilities and equipment
No later than October 31, 2012, the Contractor shall propose dates and location for a workshop in Honolulu, Hawaii in the spring (e.g., April) of 2013. The final date and venue shall be coordinated with the TPO. The workshop is tentatively expected to last 2.5 days, which would entail three nights lodging for most of the participants; it is preferable to hold the workshop in the same hotel where participants would be staying. The workshop shall begin at approximately 8:30 a.m. each day. The room shall accommodate up to 25 participants. The Contractor shall arrange for a projector and screen, computer, laser pointer, and easel paper and markers.
B. Identify workshop participants
The Contractor shall identify 25 workshop participants, using as a starting point a draft list of potential participants provided by the TPO. The Contractor shall schedule a call with the TPO and partners to discuss a strategy for narrowing the list.
The Contractor shall ensure that work under this project does not contain any apparent or real personal or organizational conflict of interest. The Contractor shall certify that no conflict of interest exists at the time the proposal is submitted for EPA approval with an update provided at the time of the workshop.  The contractor shall provide the following conflict of interest certification in the quote:
I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, no actual, apparent, or potential organizational or individual conflicts of interest related to this purchase order exist.  Personnel, who perform work under this purchase order, or relating to the purchase order, have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational interests.  All actual, apparent or potential organizational or individual conflicts of interest related to this purchase order have been reported to the Project Officer or are attached, if applicable.
The contractor shall be responsible for submitting with its quote a conflict of interest certification for any subcontractor services.
The Contractor shall clearly identify itself as an EPA Contractor when acting in fulfillment of this purchase order.  The Contractor may not participate in decision-making activities relating to Agency policy, enforcement or future contracting.  Except for meetings with EPA employees, all work under this purchase order shall be done offsite.  If the Contractor has a need to meet with Federal employees on-site, the Contractor personnel shall visibly wear identification in performance of this contract while on-site that will be issued by the Government upon arrival to the Federal facility.
The contractor shall provide the TPO with a list of proposed experts.  The TPO will verify technical qualifications of each proposed expert.  Upon approval of the TPO, the Contractor shall contact these experts to ensure that they are available to review workshop guidance and attend the workshop. 
The Contractor shall be responsible for making travel and lodging arrangements for non-Federal participants consistent with U.S. government travel, lodging, and per diem allowances. Airfare will be reimbursed at actual cost. It is anticipated that there will be approximately 10-12 non-Federal attendees; however, because outside partners will be contributing travel funding for some participants, the Contractor under this purchase order shall only be responsible for travel and lodging for eight (8) participants. The contractor shall not compensate or reimburse Federal personnel.
C. Participant invitations and logistics
The Contractor shall be responsible for handling invitations and registration for all participants prior to the workshop. The Contractor shall submit a draft letter of invitation for review and comment by the TPO, after which the Contractor shall finalize the letter for use in sending email invitations. The Contractor shall email letters of invitation to each workshop participant and provide for an attendance confirmation mechanism.  
Four weeks prior to the workshop, the Contractor shall send all participants packages that include a proposed agenda (developed in consultation with the TPO) and general information on the workshop. The packages shall also include workshop exercise guidance or other pre-workshop materials designated by the TPO. The contractor shall instruct the workshop participants to review the workshop material and submit comments prior to date of workshop.
Copies of all mailings shall be sent to the Contracting Officer?s Representatives (COR) as well as the TPO for review in advance of mailing.  The Contractor shall maintain a current address list of all workshop participants.
Task 3 ? Onsite and post-workshop support
The Contractor shall provide on-site logistical support during the workshop and compile a post-workshop report.
A. Onsite workshop support
At the workshop, the Contractor shall: serve as liaison with meeting facility staff; register invited participants and observers; answer questions for participants and observers; assist the meeting facilitator(s); copy and distribute information generated at the workshop; and ensure that audio/visual equipment is available and working properly. The Contractor shall be responsible for collecting and maintaining all materials (e.g., workshop presentations, exercise worksheets, handouts) to facilitate the post-workshop report.
B. Workshop report
Two weeks after the workshop, the Contractor shall submit a draft post-workshop report, including: names and contact information for all final participants; the finalized workshop agenda; a copy of any finalized exercise(s) used at the workshop; a compilation of all presentations given at the workshop; any relevant materials submitted by participants prior to or during the workshop; and notes of the rapporteurs at the workshop, consolidated/integrated as per discussion with the TPO. A final report will be submitted within two weeks of receiving TPO comments on the draft report. &#8195; IV. SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />SAQMMA12R0262<br />Notice Type: <br />Presolicitation <br />Synopsis:
<p>INFORMATIONAL NOTICE ONLY - NO RESPONSE IS SOLICITED AT THIS TIME</p>
<p>The solicitation will be released in June, 2012 for award in July, 2012.</p>
<p>The Department of State (DoS or Department) seeks to designate, through an unrestricted competitive source selection process, a qualified insurance company as its exclusive Defense Base Act insurance provider (Insurer) for a period of two years with an option to extend for six months. The Insurer shall sell the insurance to DoS contractors at the rates no higher than those set forth in an Agreement with the Department according to employee categories as follows:<br /><br />SERVICE EMPLOYEES (excluding Security Employees, Construction Employees, and Aviation Employees): Workers, either professional (e.g., registered professional engineers, licensed medical personnel, etc.) or non-professional, whose efforts are to accomplish discrete, often recurring, tasks that are not intended to result in an end-item of supply or a complete and useable facility. Such workers include, but are not limited to, information technology systems operators, consultants in any discipline, unarmed security personnel, architects, office administrators, researchers, cafeteria workers, nurses, maintenance personnel, drivers, housekeepers, flight-line personnel, medical technicians, grounds-keepers, hospital administrators, doctors and nurses, etc.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYEES: Workers whose efforts are customarily associated with construction projects for complete and useable facilities or complete and useable alterations to existing facilities. Such workers include, but are not limited to, laborers, equipment operators, electricians, carpenters, painters, welders, concrete workers, steel workers, roofers, interior finishers, plumbers, glazers, etc.<br /><br />SECURITY EMPLOYEES: Workers who are armed and charged with the security of specific persons; property and/or facilities, including movement or transportation of persons and/or property between secure locations.<br /><br />AVIATION EMPLOYEES: Persons performing the onboard, ground-movement and in-flight operational duties associated with operating the aircraft under the direction and control of the pilot-in-command. Such workers include, but are not limited to, pilots and flight crew.<br /><br />The Department will consider offers from companies that qualify as follows:<br /><br />a. The offeror is rated as at least A- in A. M. Best's Insurance Report www.ambest.com (or an equivalent rating with a comparable insurance reporting company) for the prior five years.<br />b. The offeror is on the United States Department of Labor list of insurance carriers approved to provide Defense Base Act insurance. www.dol.gov/esa</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />The "Defense Base Act" or "DBA" of 1941, Public Law 208 (42 U.S.C. 1651, et seq.) and the War Hazards Compensation Act ("WHCA") [42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1701 et seq.] provide workers' compensation benefits for the employees of U.S. Government contractors working overseas. DBA adopts most of the provisions of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 901-950, including insurance and benefit structures, claims procedures, and appeals process. Coverage is 24 hours a day and includes sickness, accident, injury and death. When a covered injury or death occurs to an employee, the contractor/employer notifies the Insurer who then makes a claim determination, and pays DBA compensation and medical benefits to the employee or his estate. <br /><br />When applicable, the Defense Base Act requires U.S. Government contractors to purchase workers' compensation insurance for their employees. If the recipients of Department of State grants or cooperative agreements award any contracts under their grants or cooperative agreements, the Defense Base Act requires those recipients' contractors and subcontractors at any tier to insure their employees. The federal government covers the costs of any injury or death that proximately results from a war-risk hazard as defined in the War Hazards Compensation Act by reimbursing the Insurer for the benefits it pays to the employee/beneficiary plus up to 15% for claims expenses. The effect of the War Hazards Compensation Act is to reduce significantly the risk to insurers of offering workers' compensation in a combat zone because it transfers the risk of injury during an attack to the federal government. The Insurer must coordinate with the Department of Labor to obtain reimbursement for any compensation it pays to an employee resulting from a war risk hazard. <br /><br />The term "eligible contractors" in the Agreement is defined as (1) any contractor and/or subcontractor at any tier required by law to obtain Defense Base Act insurance for its employees, and (2) any contractor and/or subcontractor at any tier required by law to obtain Defense Base Act insurance for its employees and which has been awarded a contract by a recipient of a Department of State grant or cooperative agreement. The recipients of Grants and Cooperative Agreements and their employees are not Government contractors and are not defined as eligible contractors under this Agreement. The Department will not require eligible contractors to purchase Defense Base Act insurance from the Insurer when: (1) they are self-insured in accordance with DoL regulations; (2) a waiver has been granted under FAR 28.305 (d) or Section 16 of the Department of State Basic Authorities Act (22 U.S.C. 2680a); or (3) they demonstrate to the Contracting Officer that they are able to obtain insurance from a DoL approved insurer at lower rates than those established in the Agreement.<br /><br />Information in this notice is subject to change and may be superseded by subsequent notices and/or other official Government documents.<br />Contracting Office Address: <br />P.O. Box 9115<br />Rosslyn Station<br />Arlington, Virginia 22219 <br />United States <br />Place of Performance: <br />Washington, D.C Metropolitan area and other US DoS Locations</p>

<CONTACT>Graham K. Oliff Jr., 407-208-3450

<a href="mailto:graham.k.oliff@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement for RFIJ Systems.  The RFIJ system hardware simulates or replicates actual threat jamming waveforms of existing and emerging threat open air jamming systems which are available world-wide.  These jamming waveforms are targeted against United States (US) armed forces and their voice communications, data transmissions and Global Positioning System (GPS) signals.  Tentative delivery location is Redstone Arsenal, AL in Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-2014.<BR><BR>Acronym List:<BR>RJU - Remote Jamming Unit<BR>AGPSJ	 - Advanced GPS Jammer<BR>SUT - System Under Test<BR>CST - Control Signal Transmitter<BR>OAC - Open Air Capability<BR>FCC - Federal Communications Commission<BR>COMS - Communications<BR>HMMWV - High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle<BR><BR>RFIJ Systems have three major components comprising its key jamming functions.  They are as follows:<BR><BR>1.  Control Signal Transmitter (CST):  An electronics device that broadcasts signals (30 to 3000 MHz) that activate and direct both the RJU and AGPSJ injection jammer units attached to the SUTs scattered across the test range in use.  The CST is positioned on a test range just as live jamming assets would be; however, instead of broadcasting actual jamming waveforms, the device transmits (FCC allowed) un-restricted control tones.  These tones are received by the RJU and/or AGPSJ devices attached to the SUTs. These "injection jammers" then translate the control tones received into pre-programmed commands and commences insert or "inject" these pre-programmed threat waveforms into the SUT.  This is what is referred to as "Injection Jamming."  <BR><BR>2.  COMS Remote Jamming Unit (RJU):  A low power electronics package in a rugged metal case that simultaneously produces up to four separate threat representative jamming signals (30 to 3000 MHz) used against voice and data transmissions which the RJU inserts (or injects) into the SUT directly into the receiver circuitry.  This process mimics the effect of using a live, open-air jammer, but eliminates the unintended consequences (ex. jamming equipment that aren't part of the test event) associated with such live jamming into the atmosphere.<BR><BR>3.  Advanced GPS Jammer (AGPSJ):  Similar in size and function as the RJU; however, it concentrates on injecting various GPS threat jamming signals (1227.6 to 1575.42 MHz) which in turn denies, disrupts or distorts the true GPS signal location transmissions.  The distortion or the transmission of erroneous GPS signal data is commonly referred to as "Spoofing."<BR><BR>Both the RJU and AGPSJ housing use the same case.<BR><BR>In FY 2013 and continuing in FY 2014, the contemplated procurement will consist of:<BR><BR>1.  Five-Channel RJU Devices:  These units will contain both COMS and GPS injection jamming capabilities.  The operating parameters of these 5-channel units will match those of the previous injection jammers (30 - 3000 MHz).  It is anticipated that 290 devices will be procured.<BR><BR>2.  The second item to be procured during this timeframe will be the Low Power, All Weather, Remotely positioned, autonomously operating Control Signal Transmitter and Open Air Capability (CST-OAC) unit.  While the design will be true to the original CST capabilities (30 - 3000 MHz), this unit will have a much shorter operating range by using a lower powered (estimated 10 Watt instead of 50 Watt) amplifier.  These units will be capable of achieving one week of continuous operations and only require minimal servicing during that time.  Plans are to use a Harris RF-7800 or an Intuicom EB6 plus TAC radio (Government furnished) for remote control operations.  It is anticipated that 40 devices will be procured.<BR><BR>3.  Two-Channel (Man-Portable) RJU Device:  These units will contain COMS injection jamming capabilities and are designed to match with the JTRS SFF-B TAC Radio and its operating frequencies. This device will be installed in the Interceptor Body Armor Vest (Improved Outer Tactical Vest - IOTV) where it will replace one of the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPI) armor plates for testing during Operational Test events at a typical test range such as White Sands Missile Range.  It is anticipated that 220 devices will be procured.<BR><BR>It's the Government's intent to provide the complete "technical data package (TDP)" (drawings, files, firmware, etc.) for production.  The technical data package is not currently available for release; but, it will be made part of the formal solicitation. <BR><BR>RESPONSES REQUESTED:  Contractors desiring to be considered for this opportunity are requested to respond to the Contract Specialist listed below by 1600hrs on the closing date listed above.  Interested offerors shall provide the name of the company, business size, business type, other pertinent business characteristics, company location, brief synopsis of the relevant capabilities and experience, and a description of warranties that could be offered with the procured items.  For small businesses, interested offerors shall indicate how they will comply with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, if this effort were to be totally or partially set aside for small business.<BR><BR>PEO STRI will be providing a full TDP in the RFP.  Details on what industry considers to be a full TDP shall also be provided with the company information.  For example, what are the names, types, quantities, drawings and formats of the documents that industry expects in a TDP.  <BR><BR>Submissions do not have a page limit restriction.<BR><BR>ADDITIONAL INFO:  Although subject to change, the anticipated North America Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this effort is 334220, Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing.<BR><BR>DISCLAIMER: This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement.  This is not a request for proposals.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses under this announcement nor otherwise pay for preparing any information sent or the Government's use of the information.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, New York Water Science Center(NWSC) has a requirement to modify an existing stream-gaging station to raise the equipment above recent flood levels.  The existing wooden shelter attached to the top of a poured concrete stilling well shall be removed.  The concrete stilling well will be extended six feet higher with masonry block and a new masonry block shelter built atop the extended stilling well.  A new walkway with handrails will also need to be fabricated, delivered, and installed to allow access to the new shelter. Some stream-gaging stations in the Schoharie Creek basin were inundated by flood waters during the August 28, 2011 flood (Tropical Storm Irene).  The USGS seeks to raise these structures approximately six feet to maximize the probability that these gages will remain functional during future flooding events. Wooden  shelter at the USGS stream-gaging station (01351500) Schoharie Creek at Burtonsville, NY, shall be completely removed from concrete well and new shelter shall be built to extend six feet higher than the current shelter (new shelter height will be approx. 14 ft. tall  see attachment J 3 photo).  New concrete block shelter construction shall include a new steel door with heavy duty pad lock hasp and walkway to access  with handrails. All labor, materials, and other associated costs are under the scope of this requirement and are the responsibility of the contractor.  The USGS will remove and replace hydrologic monitoring equipment from gage structure.

<DESC>The project is for Building 210, a C-130 aircraft maintenance shop and administrative facility for the 302nd Airlift Wing on Peterson AFB.<br><br>The project consists of making various large-scale repairs throughout the building consisting of architectural, mechanical and electrical work. The locker rooms, restrooms and offices between hangar bays are poorly configured, resulting in inefficient space use, reduced egress widths, insufficient locker, shower, and toilet space for both men and women, and lack of handicap access. The building requires correction of fire and building code violations. Various paint finishes are deteriorated, including the hangar floor coating. Concrete in hangar bays are spalled and cracked. Room 223B is being used as a SIPRNET security room but does not have the required physical security features. <br><br>The existing steam heating system has failed. The piping, on both steam supply and condensate-return systems is leaking due to excessive corrosion and fatigue. The fuel vapor exhausting is inadequate in the maintenance bays, especially the Fuel Cell, leading to vapors being detected in the admin areas. Sanitary drains must be installed with appropriate chemical contamination protection. Critical electrical loads are not connected to the automatic transfer switch and the generator due to changes in building configuration. Circuits are not clearly indicated on panel boards. When circuits are tripped, building occupants are unable to determine locations of circuit breakers. The electrical system appears unbalanced. Lighting in maintenance bays is sufficient.<br>

<DESC>This announcement is issued as a special notice to award a brand name order to Asset Systems, Inc., 24W500 Maple Avenue, STE.214, Naperville, IL 60540-6057. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) requires continued maintenance on AssetWin Software.
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: AssetWin Enterprise SQL 2 User Network License Renewal, P/N: AWINENT-SQL-2 RENEW, Coverage Period: 8/1/2012 - 7/31/2012, QTY: 01 ea.</p>
<p>CLIN 0002: Additional Enterprise SQL Network Users License Renewal, P/N: AWINENT-SQL-NODES RENEW, Coverage Period: 8/1/2012 - 7/31/2012, QTY: 13 ea.</p>
<p>Redacted Justification: AssetWin Enterprise Oracle Software Maintenance allows continued support, fixes, enhancements and updates over a twelve-month period for fifteen users. AssetWin is currently in use by DLA. Software maintenance is required for continuous support, updates and software patches. DLA has determined that the renewal of existing software maintenance and technical support for AssetWin is necessary because of the critical role the software fills. Purchasing another manufacturers software and support thereof is significantly more expensive than the proposed action.</p>
<p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Award will be made to Asset Systems, Inc. as they are the original manufacturer of the hardware and/or software and are the only known source that can provide the required support. If there are any other firms who can satisfy this requirement, please submit a proposal by 4:00 PM. EST on Wednesday, June 20, 2012.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes. NIST is seeking Contractors with the capabilities specified herein. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.
<p>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Engineering Laboratory (EL) plans to conduct a retrospective economic impact study on manufacturing system integration standards. Product data exchange is common in almost all discrete parts manufacturing industries. But as the complexity of the design stages, production processes, and final products increase within integrated supply chains, the potential for interoperability problems increases as well.</p>
<p>The Standard for Exchange of Product (STEP) model data is a set of standards that facilitate the seamless transfer of digital representations of engineering and manufacturing data. Such representations are known as product models, and the digital information they are composed of is known as product model data.</p>
<p>Interoperability problems in the exchange of electronic product model data represent a significant cost to manufacturing companies. These costs are primarily due to supporting multiple CAx systems and correcting errors introduced in the exchange of product model data. Together, computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and product data management (PDM) systems are referred to as CAx. CAx interoperability is the ability to communicate data from one software system to another.</p>
<p>NIST has made significant contributions to STEP, beginning in the mid 1980s and continuing today. NIST has contributed to the development of the STEP suite of standards, the integration of STEP functionality into applications, and the adoption of STEP functionality by end users.</p>
<p>NIST is contemplating issuing a contract to conduct an economic impact study. The contemplated study will quantify the impact NIST has had in accelerating the development and use of STEP standards to retrospectively analyze the economic impact NIST has had in the development and adoption of international standards designed to reduce interoperability problems inherent in the exchange of digital product information.</p>
<p>The scope of the study will be limited to two key segments of the U.S. manufacturing industry: <br />The transportation equipment industries (automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding, and specialty tool and die) and the electronics manufacturing industries. The intended study will produce revised estimates of both benefits and costs that have occurred since publication of an earlier study in 2002 for the transportation equipment industries and new estimates for the electronics manufacturing industries.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 541990, as those domestic sources having annual receipts of $14.0 million or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The mission of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is to collect, organize, preserve, and disseminate the world's biomedical information for the good of the public. In addition to traditional library activities related to reference services and collection development, the Library develops a wide variety of electronic resources to meet the needs of various constituencies. The Library also conducts outreach to these user communities to make them aware of the Library's resources and services and to develop their capacity to use them effectively. The Library has many specific outreach programs it supports and conducts and works with a wide variety of population groups across the U.S. The Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) coordinates the development and operation of specialized information services throughout the NLM; plans, develops, and operates a National Toxicology and Environmental Information Program (TEHIP); develops and administers a program to organize and analyze published information on the effects of drugs and chemicals on mankind; develops and implements information services and outreach programs in HIV/AIDS, consumer health, minority health and health disparities; and plans and operates an office supporting NLM's programs in disaster information. More details about the programs and services may be found on the SIS web site http://sis.nlm.nih.gov.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>The main goal of the proposed work is to:</p>
<p>Support SIS and NLM activities intended to increase access to and awareness and use of NLM's medical and health information products and services, especially within minority (Native Americans, African Americans, etc.) and other special populations (e.g., public health workforce, emergency responders, HIV/AIDS impacted, etc.) in order to increase the use of electronic health information resources, strengthen and modernize biomedical research, training and applications and reduce health disparities. The contractor is expected to assist with the development, implementation and conduct of programs and projects that focus on the use of health information technology to achieve the goal of improving use of and access to such technology and related health information. This includes alerting NLM staff about new technologies and new implementations related to telehealth, such as the use of the Internet for video medical interpreting over distance, use of GIS technology for community empowerment and health planning, use of mobile technology, and the use of social media, virtual worlds and other Web 2.0 tools. All such endeavors are for the purpose of developing capacity in special populations to use these tools and to improve their health through the use of health information technology.</p>
<p>In addition to the goal of improving health through these outreach projects, the role of the contractor is to help these collaborating or partner institutions, agencies and organizations develop the capacity to do this work independently. The contractor may also be required to assist NLM in its development of specific information resources and services for targeted populations.</p>
<p>The primary thrust of the contract is human-to-human interaction including identification of partners and development of relationships for NLM to pursue. The contractor will be representing NLM's interests and supporting NLM in its work rather than independently carrying out work of their own choosing.</p>
<p>Project Requirements</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the contractor will be required to perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Provide direct technical and programmatic support to NLM in analysis, understanding, and outreach to underserved populations and communities. Communities include, but are not limited to, refugees and their health providers, minority serving educational institutions, K-12 educators and students, HIV/AIDS affected individuals and community organizations, seniors, disaster preparedness and response agencies and organizations, and various underserved populations. Work includes the analysis of health information needs, promotion of the use of NLM's resources, assisting NLM in understanding the community and providing input and guidance to NLM as it develops resources and programs for these communities and populations.</p>
<p>Task 2: Assist NLM in identifying community partners for its outreach programs; assist NLM in developing relationships. Working closely with NLM staff, assist the Library in initiating and developing a working relationship. Assist in developing the basis for collaboration and identifying specific areas in which to work.</p>
<p>Working closely with NLM in developing and implementing projects with organizations or individuals identified. This may include subcontracting with organizations or individuals to fund specific undertakings. NLM may wish to work with up to 15 organizations or individuals in a year.</p>
<p>Task 3: Assist and support NLM in collaborations with other government (federal, state and local) agencies and offices including but not limited to local and state health and environmental protection departments; federal, state and local agencies and organizations involved in disaster planning, preparedness, response, and recovery; Department of Health and Human Service's Indian Health Service, Office of Minority Health, Office of Global Affairs, and the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Pan American Health Organization and other World Health Organization components; other relevant organizations such as the Association of Refugee Health Coordinators, Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, National Association of County and City Health Officials, Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations, and other similar groups.</p>
<p>Task 4: Assist and support the following specific ongoing NLM programs:<br />&bull; Environmental Health Information Partnership<br />&bull; Refugee Health Information Network<br />&bull; Outreach associated with the Native Voices Exhibition<br />&bull; Latin American Network for Disaster and Health Information</p>
<p>These four tasks may include participating in the development of programs for or with these groups. All programs are health information or health information technology-related activities. In some cases, the contractor shall implement programs independently, mainly through subcontracts, after they have been developed in conjunction with NLM staff. Approximately 10-15 such subcontracts may be implemented each year. The contractor may also conduct program assessments or evaluations, write reports, provide background research, etc. The contractor may assist in providing on-the-ground technical support and guidance during the implementation and conduct of a project. This may require site visits and meetings held remote from NLM. The contractor may also be required to organize 1-2 workshops, symposia, or conferences related to this work. The goal of these site visits and other interactions is to provide support, direction and guidance to outreach activities promoted and supported by NLM. Working with special populations is often difficult and requires a substantial amount of direct interaction. Travel and interactions will generally be within the U.S. However, approximately 3-5 trips may be international. In addition to the goal of improving health through these outreach projects, the role of the contractor is to help these institutions, agencies and organizations develop the capacity to do this work independently.</p>
<p>Government Estimated Level of Effort</p>
<p>The government estimates that the following level of effort/total labor hours will be needed from the Contractor to perform the required services. The vendor may propose other level of effort/total labor hours, if they would contribute to a more efficient solution; however, the vendor must demonstrate that the personnel and proposed level of effort/total labor hours meet the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>Professional/technical programmatic support is required approximately 6 days per month. This is for direct involvement in NLM activities such as managing specific projects, developing agendas and organizing workshops, participating in local and national meetings related to this work, conducting assessments, authoring or drafting materials, networking to pursue a project, etc.</p>
<p>Administrative management of NLM projects takes approximately 5 days per month. This includes negotiating agreements with subcontractors and maintaining oversight over financial management of these projects, logistics support for travel related to projects, etc.</p>
<p>SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 39.2, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is implemented in this order. Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.hhs.gov/od.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the period of performance shall be for a base year with four (4) option years. It is anticipated that additional funding will be provided for each activity. An award is anticipated to be made around August 2012. It is anticipated that the contract will be an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type.</p>
<p>Contract Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor will implement specific tasks as defined above during the period of performance. The contractor shall implement these tasks with minimal direction, but in close collaboration with the government.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities</p>
<p>The government shall provide the contractor access to relevant SIS and NLM information and staff.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables<br /><br />The contractor shall meet with selected members of the SIS leadership team on an as needed basis. Meetings will be held at the NLM site, and/or via teleconferencing. (All resulting software and reports will become the property of the Government.)</p>
<p>Financial reports will be submitted monthly<br />Narrative reports will be submitted quarterly</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements</p>
<p>The (database/products/ reports) delivered by the contractor will be reviewed and approved for acceptance by the Project Officer upon delivery by the contractor.</p>
<p>Travel</p>

<a href="mailto:joseph.l.morse6.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - RTP</a>
<DESC>The  Silicon Carbide (SiC) High-Voltage Power Technology (HVPT) program is a one-year Army (Congressional special interest) applied research effort focused on extending the state-of-the-art (SOA) in SiC semiconductor switch design, epitaxial material growth (>100 micrometers), semiconductor device fabrication, and multi-die packaging for high-voltage (HV) applications.  Proposals are solicited that show a path for increased current density (at high-efficiency), die size, switching frequency, and blocking voltage (>10 kV) for both low- and high-duty-cycle switches.   SiC is an emerging power semiconductor material that has electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties that allow it to far surpass the performance of conventional silicon (Si) power technology and make it the prime candidate for next-generation high-voltage switching devices for military, as well as commercial, applications.<br><br>Proof-of-concept, SiC high-voltage power devices have been demonstrated to provide greater than twice the current density of Si power devices and at greater efficiency.  This program endeavors to advance the United States' capability to provide SiC high-voltage high-power semiconductor switches,  to identify limitations that must be overcome to attain the next high-water mark in SiC device high-voltage performance, and advance the United States' capability to provide high-voltage semiconductor device packaging solutions.  Technology limitations/gaps identified by this program may be the focus of more sustained development efforts in the future. <br><br>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Research Triangle Park Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD) is soliciting proposals for the SiC HEPS program under Topic 1.4.3, "Wide Band-Gap Power Devices," of the ARL Core Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Basic and Applied Scientific Research for Fiscal Years 2012 through 2017 at W911NF-12-R-0011.   Funding is currently available for the award of up to three cooperative agreements related to the SiC HVPT program for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 funds.    While the BAA and Topic remain open for proposal submission until, 31 March 2017, in order to be eligible for the agreement to be awarded with the funding available for FY 2012, proposals must be received in accordance with the due dates and instructions provided in this announcement.    It is anticipated that up to three "cooperative agreements" (31 USC 6305) will be awarded, pursuant to 10 USC 2358 Research Projects, each with a period of performance between twelve and eighteen months.  The total amount available for all awards is approximately $7,800,000.00.  The principal purpose of the cooperative agreements is for the public purpose of the support and stimulation of fundamental research and not the acquisition of property or provision of services for the direct benefit or use of the Government.  The Recipient of the cooperative agreements will work collaboratively with scientists from ARL to further the SiC HVPT program.    ARL will participate in the research and use its strong in-house technical expertise to jointly plan and execute the research program with the Recipient.   ARL will evaluate the fabricated power devices to Army-specific circuit stresses and analyzing the devices' electrical and physical response.  These analyses and supporting data will be shared with the Recipient and ways to augment the device design, process and or starting material to improve performance will be jointly determined.  ARL's Device Reliability Physics, Pulse Switches and Circuit teams will participate in this collaboration.<br><br>Solutions are sought for the development of SiC HV bi-polar, semiconductor switches with single die blocking voltages in the range of 15,000 V to 24,000 V and have a single-die current capacity of 10 A.   These switches should be capable of turn-off at the maximum conduction current rating.  The Army is considering several application examples wherein HV switches are utilized.  One application requires switches to operate in a totem-pole configuration at +15,000 V and -10,000 V, 30 A (peak), and a frequency of 35 kHz.  A second application requires power switches and diodes to control the discharge of 20 kV storage capacitors (microsecond discharge time) in a Marx-type power supply with 10 A average current and 100 A short-circuit currents.  It is anticipated that, over the period of performance, the Recipient(s) will be able to demonstrate incremental device performance and fabrication capabilities and/or improvements thereof.  Because component packaging is also a thrust of this program, Recipient(s) will develop and demonstrate packaging concepts that provide for voltage isolation, heat transfer, current, and frequency such that the SiC device performance is not limited by the packaging approach and minimize total volume.  As the Recipient provides device deliverables to the Government, characterizations of the switches and the appropriate HV packaging will enable the Army to assess the state-of-the-art in HV semiconductor switch technology and provide power devices for demonstration circuits that will strive to meet Army requirements.<br><br>Since the HVPT program goals align well with future SiC high-voltage commercial applications, it is expected that the Recipient will include matching funds of no less than 25% in their proposal plans.  There will be no equipment purchases using federal funds associated with awards made as a result of this announcement.  <br><br>In order to be eligible for the cooperative agreements to be awarded with the FY2012 funding for this program, offerors are to submit proposals in accordance with the submissions instructions under BAA W911NF-12-R-0011 no later than 11 July 2012.   Proposals will be evaluated using the criteria listed in the BAA.  Any Questions concerning the award(s) process shall be directed to: Joseph "Skip" Morse by email: joseph.l.morse6.civ@mail.mil.  This special notice expires 11 July 2012 at 11:59 PM (EST). <br>

<DESC>The  Silicon Carbide (SiC) High-Efficiency Power Switches (HEPS) program is a four-year  joint Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Army basic and applied research effort focused on increasing SiC starting material  (substrates and epi-wafers) growth and device process technology from  4" to 6" diameter  for fabrication of cost-effective high-efficiency power devices.  <br><br>This program also endeavors to push the state of the art in current density (at high-efficiency), die size, and operating voltage for both continuous and pulse duty power devices within the constraints of meeting Army intermediate cost and process yield goals listed in Table 1 below.   By transitioning the SiC technology to the larger diameter starting material and the larger area device processes that it enables, the cost (a critical risk factor in the use of this technology by the Army and the rest of the Department of Defense (DoD)) of the resultant power devices will be reduced significantly.  <br><br>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Research Triangle Park Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD) is soliciting proposals for the SiC HEPS program under Topic 1.4.3, "Wide Band-Gap Power Devices," of the ARL Core Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Basic and Applied Scientific Research for Fiscal Years 2012 through 2017 at W911NF-12-R-0011.   Funding is currently available for the award of one cooperative agreement related to the SiC HEPS program beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2012.    While the BAA and Topic remain open for proposal submission until, 31 March 2017, in order to be eligible for the agreement to be awarded with the funding available for FY 2012, proposals must be received in accordance with the due dates and instructions provided in this announcement.    It is anticipated that the single "cooperative agreement" (31 USC 6305) will be awarded, pursuant to 10 USC 2358 Research Projects, in the total estimated amount of $17,000,000.00 over a 4-year period of performance.with approximate funding profile: FY12 - $300,000.00, FY13 - $5,000,000.00, FY14 - $5,000,000.00, FY15 - $4,700,000.00, FY16 - $ 2,000,000.00 The principal purpose of the cooperative agreement is for the public purpose of the support and stimulation of fundamental research and not the acquisition of property or provision of services for the direct benefit or use of the Government.  The Recipient of the cooperative agreement will work collaboratively with scientists from ARL to further the SiC HEPS program.    ARL will participate in the research and use its strong in-house technical expertise to jointly plan and execute the research program with the Recipient.   ARL will evaluate the fabricated power devices to Army-specific circuit stresses and analye the devices' electrical and physical response.  These analyses and supporting data will be shared with the Recipient and ways to augment the device design, process and or starting material to improve performance will be jointly determined.   ARL's Device Reliability Physics, Circuit and Pulse Switch teams will participate in this collaboration.<br><br>Research and Development solutions are sought for transition of SiC material growth and power device process technology from 4" to 6" diameter to support development of  1.2 kV metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) rated at 100 to 300 A for continuous power and  12-20 kV gate turn-off thyristors (GTOs) rated at 3.8 to 9 kA for pulse duty (1 ms) applications.  Table 1 below, provides end-of-first-year, intermediate and final goals for the program for both starting material and power devices.  Please note that FY13 goals are go/no-go metrics that must be met in order for the offerer to secure funding for the remaining 3 years of the program.  Note that while these FY13 goals are 'hero' goals (best R&D), the FY15 and final goals are ascribed to median values for process lots.<br><br>These material and device solutions are aimed at providing compact power devices (high power density) at the highest efficiency possible with reliable operation at junction temperatures (Tj) from 150  to 200 C.  MOSFETs resulting from this program are expected to operate continuously at liquid cooled heat sink temperatures from 100  to 113 C.  The high-voltage GTOs and diodes are expected to operate  at high current densities (see table 1) in a 70 C ambient without the benefit of liquid cooling and will need to sustain multiple pulses in a pulse train until limiting junction temperature is attained.  These bipolar pulse devices are expected to have at least a 1000 shot life under these conditions.  <br><br>Since the HEPS program goals align well with current 1.2 kV and future high-voltage commercial applications it is expected that an offeror will invest at least matching funds in this effort for equipment purchases that will provide a capacity (see Table 1) to grow 6" starting material (substrates and epi wafers) and process power devices on this starting material.  There will be no equipment purchases using federal funds.  Further, to reduce risk in this program, an offerer must already be commercially producing 4"4H N-SiC starting material (substrates and epi-wafers) as indicated by listings in offerer's commercial catalogue  in order to respond to this announcement. <br> <br>In order to be eligible for the cooperative agreement to be awarded with the FY2012 funding for this program,offerors are to submit proposals in accordance with the submissions instructions under BAA W911NF-12-R-0011 no later than  11 July 2012.   Proposals will be evaluated using the criteria listed in the BAA.  Any Questions concerning the award(s) process shall be directed to: Joseph "Skip" Morse by email: joseph.l.morse6.civ@mail.mil.  This special notice expires 11 July 2012 at 11:159 PM (EST). <br><br>Table will be provide upon request.<br>

<ARCHDATE>09122012
<CONTACT>Bernard H. Staab, Email bstaab@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>FBO Special Notice:
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has determined that it will not seek to award its own multiple-award Virtual Data Center Support (VDCS) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.</p>
<p>Based upon anticipating future Data Center requirements, CMS determined in early 2011 that two (2) solicitations would be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) in FY 2012. One would be the Virtual Data Center Prime (VDCP) full and open competition for major data center requirements and the other would be the VDCS small-business set-aside for all data center support work. In September, 2011, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), through the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), clearly set forth a process whereby agencies had to present a "business case", before releasing a solicitation, to support creating an agency-specific acquisition in lieu of utilizing available GWACS or multi-agency contracts. The requirement included all solicitations posted after December 31, 2011. The intent of the policy is to promote an agency to, "...leverage its buying power to the maximum extent as well as achieve administrative efficiencies and cost savings". Unfortunately, OMB found that, "...agencies establish new overlapping and duplicative contracts for supplies or services, because the agencies have not adequately considered the suitability of existing interagency contract vehicles..." Furthermore, note that a VDCS business case would have to be approved by an authority no lower than the agency's Senior Procurement Executive (SPE), following coordination with the agency's Director of the OSDBU and, since the VDCS is IT in nature, it requires CMS' CIO clearance.</p>
<p>Through market research, CMS has determined that suitable Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACS) do exist that could incorporate anticipated VDCS efforts. As with all CMS contracting requirements, CMS will conduct market research on each specific requirement to consider small business concerns.</p>
<p>Based on the subject directive and the fact that suitable contractual vehicles appear to exist that conform to the letter and intent of the OFPP directive, CMS has made this decision.</p>

The Air Force has been using MiPACS Storage Server, in combination with other Medicor Imaging products (MiPACS Dental Enterprise Viewer, MiPACS Patient Updater) to facilitate dental image storage, centralization, and accessibility since 2006. The MiPACS system currently installed needs to be modified to allow the AF to run queries to find and return results for images based on both PatientID and other ID fields. A data conversion application is needed to parse information provided from a Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) data export in order to reassign EDIPI as the primary patient ID, and social security numbers as the OtherPatientID within each of the existing DICOM files within the MiPACS database. Medicor Imaging is the only entity which can provide the services required for conversion from social security number to EDIPI. Medicor Imaging is the sole manufacturer of MiPACS Storage Server software, which is currently in use by the AF as both the server application for DDRS installations at each Air Force Base, and as the two central archives for all DDRS images. MiPACS Storage Server is a commercial-off-the-shelf application developed and maintained solely by Medicor Imaging. Medicor Imaging does not offer source code release for this product to any party in order to protect its clientele currently using MiPACS software. Therefore, all software functionality change requests can legally only be implemented by Medicor Imaging due to copyright laws. Thus, there is no legal ability to evaluate alternate proposals or to solicit for competitive offers.</p>
<p>The estimated value of this contract action is $71,500.00.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services.</p>
<p>The anticipated award date 03 July 2012.<br /><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotes; however, that all responsible sources and interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by submitting technical data for this requirement and past performance data within 15 calendar days of this notice posting (no later than 27 June 2012), by 12:00 PM EST, to Katie Hughes, via email at Katie.Hughes@dla.mil, which shall be considered by the agency. Please note telephone calls will not be honored. DLA Troop Support intends to solicit this requirement orally in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(c), thus no written solicitation will be issued.</p>

<DESC>POSTED DATE: 	6.12.2012 SUBJECT:	Northwest Arctic Harvest Surveys This announcement constitutes the only notice. This is not a request for quotes. A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Responses must be received no later than June 15, 2012 by sending an e-mail to Katherine_smiley@fws.gov; however, any technical data received will be for the sole purpose of market research for future requirements. Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Fish & Wildlife Services, Region 7 Contracting and General Services intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price order to: COMPANY:	Manilaq Association FOR :	Coordinate and oversee the collection of data on the subsistence harvest of migratory birds and their eggs in Northwest Arctic villages.  Audit the data for correctness and completeness.  Return the data (completed survey forms) to the ADFG Division of Subsistence, Anchorage.  Collect traditional ecological knowledge on the customary and traditional uses of birds and eggs ON:	June 18, 2012 to Feb 8, 2012 NAICS:	541690	Other Scientific and Technical Consulting
AUTHORITY:13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source
Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because: The 1997 Protocol Amendment to the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty between the U.S. and Canada provides for a regulated spring/summer subsistence harvest.  The Treaty Amendment lays the legal foundation for the tripartite Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council (AMBCC) consisting of Federal, State, and Native regional partners.  The report accompanying the Treaty Amendment specifies the need for harvest monitoring and that harvest information will be collected cooperatively by the AMBCC, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG), and Native regional partners.
The March 28, 2000 Federal Register notice Establishment of Management Bodies in Alaska to Develop Recommendations Related to the Spring/Summer Harvest of Migratory Birds (Volume 65, No. 60) states that annual funding agreements with Alaska Native organizations, ADFG, and others will be used to accomplish harvest monitoring.  This Federal Register notice listed the 12 Native regional partner organizations, including the Maniilaq Association (page 16408).  Maniilaq has a representative at the AMBCC.  The April 8, 2002 Federal Register Notice Procedures for Establishing Spring/Summer Subsistence Harvest Regulations for Migratory Birds in Alaska establishes the program structure for the AMBCC.  It states in section (c), Roles and Responsibilities, that the AMBCC will develop recommendations for harvest monitoring and will establish committees to gather and review data.  Maniilaq is a non-profit organization that represents the interest of tribes and villages in their region through tribal resolutions that authorize Maniilaq to act in their behalf in matters such as subsistence harvest surveys.  Another organization would not have this authority in their region.
Maniilaq has conducted subsistence harvest surveys in the Northwest Arctic regions for decades, monitoring harvests of several wildlife and fish species.  The structure associated with this work includes contacts and trained surveyors in its member villages and an office in Kotzebue with trained and experienced harvest survey personnel.  In addition to the fact that Maniilaq is a regional partner organization of the AMBCC legally charged with gathering the data, it will be more cost efficient to use Maniilaqs existing harvest monitoring system rather than creating a duplicate system.
Maniilaq is one of the three organizations that meet circumstance authorized by Statute and Maniilaq and ADFG are the only sources that meet the agency requirement.  However, because Maniilaq has the personnel, experience, and expertise in the area, if ADFG were awarded the contract, ADFG would likely subcontract with Maniilaq. Therefore, it is more efficient for the USFWS to contract directly with Maniilaq.
The nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority established by the Treaty Amendment, because the data being provided by the acquisition helps fulfill the requirement that harvest monitoring be conducted cooperatively by the three members of the AMBCC.

A laser target interface device consists of 3 major components: a detector unit, a processing/ control box, and a cable that connects from the control box to an installation provided target lifter. A sub component is a cable between the detector unit and the control box. <br>The detector unit (mounted on a target panel)picks up the MILES signal at the target lifter target, and transfer it to the electronics component (control box) of the system, which takes the signal and feeds it back to the target lifter at the hit sensor input. <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Hydroptic for two ZooScan instruments to digitally analyze plankton samples collected in response to the Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill for the National Marine Fisheries Service in Miami, FL.<br />
<p>A sources sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps on May 30, 2012 and closed on June 11, 2012. No responses were received.</p>
<p>It is necessary for these plankton samples to be analyzed quickly, and digital imaging of whole samples allows for a permanent digital record to be created in a timely manner. ZooScan is an instrument that uses a modified scanner sensor with a custom-built lighting system and a water-tight scanning chamber into which plankton samples can be poured, digitized at high-resolution, and recovered without damage. The contents of these images then can be identified, enumerated, and measured by a human working with specialized software.</p>
<p>Background<br />Colleagues at Louisiana State University, who will also carry out Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill plankton analysis, have developed the methodology for this process using ZooScan and its associated software. Therefore, it is crucial that any lab replicating these methods use the same instrument, to achieve the utmost precision. Additionally the ZooScan instrument is the instrument to be used for scanning zooplankton according to the official Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) plankton processing plan.</p>
<p>The ZooScan instrument is specifically required by NRDA/BP as part of the effort to standardize plankton sorting and processing. This standard was established in 2010 by the academic community as the Best Practice to quickly sort and identify zooplankton samples. The Southeast Fisheries Science Center is now part of this effort as they are one of four groups working to identify possible damage and access impacts to the pelagic ecosystem caused by the Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill in 2010. As a requirement of this work, all efforts must be standardized in technique as well as equipment. If this equipment is not procured, the work completed by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center could be challenged in any court case and allow other work performed by NOAA to by challenged by litigation lawyers. It is in the best interest of the U.S. Government to comply with the Natural Resource Damage Assessment NOAA standard and procure the ZooScan instruments for work to move forward expeditiously.</p>

The National Park Service intends to issue a purchase order to Rock River Arms Inc., for the purchase of five (5) tactical short barreled .223 caliber rifles for the use of law enforcement officers.    
The purchase of the Rock River Arms rifles is officer safety critical so all rifles are identical in operating mechanisms, ammunition needs, and accessory compatibility  Purchasing a brand other than Rock River Arms would introduce known and unknown incompatibilities with existing weapons and systems.  This will confuse and hinder officers utilizing these different rifles during high stress shooting/ deadly force situations.
The Government, therefore, intends to solicit, negotiate, and/or purchase this requirement on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with BRAND NAME OR EQUAL considerations.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotes; however, any and all responses must be received within 15 days of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Park Service, Bandelier National Monument, Los Alamos, New Mexico, intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract for Stormlink Satellite Rain Gauge Stations,  Stormlink Satellite Stage Gauge Stations, Contrail Web visualization and decision management tool, and support functions,  in accordance with 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Award will be made to OneRain, Inc. of Longmont, Colorado.  This notice of intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest, Proposals or Quotations.  A determination by the Park Service not to open this requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Park Service in consideration of what is in the best interest of the Government.  The Park Service intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order within 5 days of this announcement.  The magnitude of this award will be between $25,000 and $100,000 and the NAICS Code is 541990. This announcement is for informational purposes only.
The Silver Jackets team, the Pueblos, (CESPA), (BAER) team, and National Park Service all supported the immediate necessity of installing an early warning system to alert downstream communities, workers in the watershed and recreation users of the imminent threat of flood and debris flows. Recommendations for the type of system came from an evaluation of what local systems existed, what the availability of the equipment for the system was and the inter-operability of the system as a whole. Representatives of the USGS, the BAER team and the BIA were in the best positions to recommend a system, based on the fact that BIA has an extant system in Santa Clara Canyon that is also used nationally in its dam safety program, USGS is expert in installing and archiving data from such a system, and the BAER team is considered an expert in the field of burned area restoration. The USGS, the BAER team and the BIA all endorsed the OneRain StormLink Satellite Rain and Rain & Stage Gauge system specified in this Scope of Work. The CESPA Lake Operations Office also agreed with this choice of equipment and the necessity of getting installed as quickly as possible.  
The purchase of the equipment and software from OneRain is critical to the monitoring of the Las Conchas burn area for flooding.  The equipment and software purchased from OneRain will greatly enhance the National Park Service's ability to monitor the burn area in Frijoles Canyon and other parts of Bandelier National Monument affected by the Las Conchas fire.  All agencies listed in item 3 will be able to have data uploaded directly into the secure servers at OneRain and the data shared by all in a timely manner.  Purchasing a different system would from a different vendor would not allow seamless interoperability between agencies monitoring the burn area

<DESC>United States Department of the Interior NATIONAL PARK SERVICE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK PO Box 168 Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming 82190 	 
Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition
Date:	June 12, 2012 Project:	Exelis-E3De Software
1.	Identifications
a.	Agency:		National Park Service b.	Contracting Office:	Yellowstone National Park
2.	Description of the action being approved: The National Park Service (NPS) shall be soliciting for Exelis-E3De Software. The documents included with the solicitation call for specific brand name products that are peculiar to one manufacturer. This written justification provides approval for limiting competition to the listed brand name products as authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).
3.	Scope of Work and Government Cost Estimate: Exelis will provide an E3De software license, service, and technical support at the cost of $5,000.  E3De software will allow an efficient and integrated workflow for assessing, visualizing, analyzing, or processing LiDAR data associated with a CESU agreement.  4.	Authority:	 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
5.	The description of the contractor's unique qualifications or the unique nature of the acquisition: Other software packages offer basic support for viewing (ie ArcGIS 10) and some limited/product generation.  E3de allows advanced LiDAR processing and product generation (editing of bad points, DEM, feature extraction and export, etc) capabilities with control over how the source data is utilized in processing and product creation.  E3De also is optimized for modern multi-core processing and integrates with existing software such as ENVI and ESRI products.  Currently, companies do not offer the data control and easy product generation within 1 integrated software package.  Multiple add-on software packages may be necessary, resulting in a less efficient workflow or additional software costs.
6.	Efforts to obtain competition: An Intent to Sole Source announcement will be posted on FedBizOpps.  Additionally, Cheryl Jawarowski made several phone calls to Exelis competitors (market research is on file).
7.	Determination that costs will be fair & reasonable: Using web resources, emails and phone conversations, I found that the price quote for the software was within the range (intermediate cost) of similar software products offered in the commercial market.
8.	Description of the research conducted: I visited web sites (ERDAS/Intergraph, LPS bundles, Terrasolid) and asked companies about competitors in the industry (QT Modeler is a stand-alone software).  See hard copies of research conducted. Also, I investigated the capabilities of our current software (ERDAS Imagine, LPS Core, ENVI, ArcGIS 10, and low-cost LIDAR software from a workshop) and discussed my assessment with commercial software companies.  Thus, I understand the current limitations and capabilities of similar software packages.  This research allowed me to assess how the E3De uniquely meets our needs and compliments our current image processing /GIS investments.
9.	Other facts supporting other than full & open competition: An investment has been made in learning image processing and GIS software with steep learning curves.  Software that integrates with existing image processing and GIS software means less down-time learning a new program that is not tailored to our needs or geoscience applications (ie software tailored for civil engineers). 
10.	Interested Sources: Software competitors such as ERDAS/Intergraph and ESRI/ARCGIS as well as Exelis are represented in our organization.  We already use multiple software companies in our work environment.
11.	Actions to remove barriers to competition in the future for similar acquisitions: I will keep abreast of the fast-paced, image processing/digital mapping market place and see how industry competitors may meet future needs.
12.	Certifications:
a) Technical/Requirements Certification:
I have evaluated the validity of this justification and do hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Requestor's: Signature:	Cheryl Jawarowski			Date:	6/12/2012	

b)  Contracting Officer Certification:
I have reviewed this justification and in accordance with the procedures noted by the National Park Service's Contracting Officer's Technical Instruction (COTI) 1443.6 - 01, do hereby approve acquisition by means of other than full and open competition.

Approve: Signature:	Stacy Vallie			Date:	6/12/2012

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS. THE WORK ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYNOPSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED.</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Modification 20 is to deobligate $416,646.85 in ARRA funding that was not expended in support of the work assignments issued under Contract EP-C-11-004 which supported ARRA. All ARRA funded work assignments were completed as of November 30, 2011. Total ARRA funded is reduced to $3,007,410.74. <br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) - Atlantics (SSC-A) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for systems and techniques to support waveform portability for heterogeneous wireless handhelds.   SSC-A has been tasked to conduct a feasibility study to provide interoperability of tactical and commercial handheld equipments for different waveforms, such as GSM, CDMA, LTE, APCO P25, JTRS, etc., which emphasizes cloud-based optimization and management of both voice and data services.  This capability study will provide an assessment of technical alternatives using latest techniques and protocols in SDR fields.  This RFI is interested in identifying useful products and/or appropriate end-to-end solutions.  The intent of this study and subsequent projects is to develop the next generation wireless communication solutions to support tactical and mission-critical operations for DoD and other agencies.  This study aims to fully explore the potential brought in with the advancement in commercial cellular systems and cloud computing as well as the developments in tactical radio standards.  It envisions a future family of systems that can intelligently manage the deployment and usage of tactical radio stations and handhelds using all available wireless network resources.  Such systems should take advantage of latest commercial smartphone and cloud applications to the fullest extent. Each submission should address the required hardware, software, compliant standards and protocols, RF equipment, power options, operational and maintenance requirements.  More specifically this RFI is to solicit the capabilities from the industry addressing two components in studying and testing waveform portability of commercial/tactical cellular/wireless systems: Development support of system and application software that implement heterogeneous commercial/tactical waveforms. This is an Internet capable server that can host the SDKs and APIs for various commercial and tactical wireless waveforms. It provides necessary tools to develop and manage computing applications that reside in a cloud and that communicate (end-end) with mobile applications installed on commercial/tactical handhelds. Test environments of various waveforms that deliver the above developed applications. The core function of this component is to connect the mobile application server to software-defined radios (SDR). Therefore a commercial handheld or a tactical radio can communicate with a wireless access point using various waveforms. This component can be in the form of either a wireless server of computer and radio, or a femtocell, picocell or microcell. This RFI asks the vendors for products that can provide functions for part or all of these two components.  The SSC-A Tactical and Wireless Network team supports this capability study and any potential future procurement, integration, and deployment purposes will use all information received.  It is the Governments discretion on whether to execute any efforts associated with this capability study.   SUBMITTALS The information received shall be reviewed to conduct objective, comparative assessments and validation of commercial equipment and systems. This RFI is for INFORMATION GATHERING and PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer.  The Government DOES NOT INTEND to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. All information received will be treated as public knowledge; therefore, vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI.   Ensure final submission addresses, at a minimum, all items and design drivers below (specify the  availability) as part of your Technical Submission (include Cost and lead time ordering information). 1. Hardware architecture and software modules with complete block diagrams, APIs, development and administration capabilities, and their performance as applicable (for each of the following) 2. Commercial and/or tactical wireless communication standards to be supported 3. Cellular or wireless communication management and optimization functionalities 4. Waveform processing and the support including but not limited to SCA, SDR, VHDL, JTRS API 5. VoIP and data capabilities 6. LPD/LPE/LPI functionalities 7. Traffic provisioning/filtering functionalities 8. Security functionality The submitted information will be evaluated for inclusion in the Waveform Portability Study and evaluated for future deployment efforts.  Consequently, follow-up requests for feedback should not be made through Federal Business Opportunities posting agency.  Vendors may be contacted following submission for more detailed product information. Please provide Administrative Information below: Company information, main staff point of contact (POC) info, including name, address, phone number, and website link (as available). Whether the company is a Cellular hardware product provider, technical consultant, manufacturer, distributor, and/or cellular service provider (Global or National). The provider or vendor submission should not exceed 25 pages total.

The system will include a treadmill and  two pair of standard shorts each in sizes samll, medium, large and extra large.  This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than June 22, 2012  noon local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Michele Devine, Contract Specialist, e-mail: michele.g.devine.ctr@us.army.mil <br><br>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).<br><br> The Alter G is the only anti-gravity treadmill that uses an advanced pressure regulation system. AlterG owns all rights and patents to anti-gravity treadmills. The technology was developed at NASA and further developed by Alter G for medical rehabilitation. Users can choose to reduce their effective body weight by as much as 80% (in as small as 1% increments). AlterG offers the only treadmill that uses differential air pressure to incrementally and progressively permit patients with lower extremity injuries to exercise in a stress free anti-gravity environment.  The AlterG anti-gravity treadmill supports full range motion for upper and lower body, keeps patients in place, maintains lateral support preventing falls associated with rehabilitation. AlterG anti-gravity rehabilitative exercise treadmill equipment considerably lowers the stress on healing leg muscles, tendons, and hips typically seen with normal treadmills.<br>

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>Subfactor 4 - Diversity. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>WS-MI is conducting a project, funded through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which is attempting to protect turtle nest from high levels of predation by raccoons at Kensington Metropark near Brighton, MI only. It is believed that in recent years virtually all turtle nests have been predated by raccoons which has serious impacts to the turtle population. WS-MI will be trapping and removing raccoons but does not have the expertise to evaluate the outcomes of turtle nests. What is needed is for turtle nests in selected areas of Kensington to be found, categorized and monitored to determine the fate of the nests. This information provides critical feedback to us so that we can evaluate the success of raccoon removal. EPA, which has funded this project, will be looking for this kind of evaluation to consider future funding.</p>

             1.4   ENGINEERING CHANGES 
              
                     (a)     The Government may
             solicit, and the Contractor is 
             encouraged to propose independently,
             engineering changes to the equipment 
             and software specifications, or other
             requirements.  These changes may be 
             proposed to save money, to improve
             performance, to save energy, or to 
             satisfy increased data processing
             requirements.  However, if proposed 
             changes relating to improved
             performance are necessary to meet
             increased data processing requirements
             of the user, those requirements shall
             not exceed the delivery order
             requirements by more than 25%.  If the
             proposed changes are acceptable to
             both parties, the Contractor shall
             submit a price change proposal to the
             Government for evaluation.  Those
             proposed engineering changes that are
             acceptable to the Government will be 
             processed as modifications to the
             delivery order.  
                     (b)     For proposed changes
             identified by the Contractor, the 
             following information shall be
             submitted with each proposal: 
                     (1)     A description of the
             difference between the existing 
             requirement and the proposed
             requirement, the comparative
             advantages and disadvantages of each,
             a justification when an item's
             function or characteristics are being
             altered, the effect of the change on
             the end item's performance, and any
             pertinent objective test data.  
                     (2)     A list and analysis of
             the contract requirements that must be
             changed if the engineering change is
             accepted, including any suggested
             specification revisions.  
                     (3)     Identification of the
             unit to which the engineering change
             applies.  
                     (4)     A separate, detailed
             cost estimate for (A) the affected 
             portions of the existing requirement
             and (B) the engineering change.  
                     (5)     A description and
             estimate of costs the Government may 
             incur in implementing the engineering
             change.  
                     (6)     A prediction of any
             effects the proposed change would have
             on collateral costs to the agency.  
                     (7)     A statement of the
             time by which an accepted engineering 
             change must be issued in order to
             achieve the maximum cost reduction, 
             noting any effect on the completion
             time or delivery schedule.  
                     (8)     Identification of any
             previous submissions of the 
             engineering change, including the
             dates submitted, the agencies and 
             identification numbers involved and
             previous Government actions, if known.  
                     (c)     Engineering change
             proposals shall be processed 
             expeditiously.  The Contractor has the
             right to withdraw, in whole or in 
             part, any engineering change proposal
             not accepted by the Government within
             the period specified in the
             engineering change proposal.  The 
             decision of the Contracting Officer,
             or designee, as to the acceptance of 
             any such proposal under this contract
             shall be final. 
                     (d)     The Contracting
             Officer, or designee, may accept any 
             engineering change proposal submitted
             by giving the Contractor written 
             notice thereof.  This written notice
             shall be given by issuance of a 
             modification to the delivery order. 
             Unless and until a modification is 
             executed to incorporate an engineering
             change proposal, the Contractor shall
             remain obligated to perform in
             accordance with the terms of the 
             existing delivery order.  
                     (e)     If an engineering
             change proposal submitted is accepted 
             and applied, an equitable adjustment
             in the delivery order price shall be 
             made. 
                     (f)     The Contractor is
             required to identify specifically any 
             information contained in the
             engineering change proposal which the 
             Contractor considers confidential
             and/or proprietary and which the 
             Contractor prefers not be disclosed to
             the public.  The identification of 
             information as confidential and/or
             proprietary is for information 
             purposes only and shall not be binding
             on the Government to prevent 
             disclosure of such information. 
             Offerors are advised that such 
             information may be subject to release
             upon request pursuant to the Freedom
             of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).

             MONITORS 
              
                     The Contractor shall permit
             inclusion or attachment of such 
             devices as the Government may choose
             to employ for the purpose of examining
             or measuring the activity within the
             system.  Devices such as equipment
             monitors, which may require physical
             connection to the system, and devices
             such as software monitors, which may

             control software to be displaced, are
             specifically included in this
             category.  The Contractor may not
             prohibit the installation of such 
             devices unless the particular device
             will cause significant or permanent 
             damage to the system.  The Contractor
             shall assist the Government in 
             identifying and locating device
             connections when requested by the 
             Government if the Contractor provides
             such service to other customers.  Cost
             for this service, if any, is to be
             included in the Contractor's price
             proposal.

Essential Characteristics
Portable Suction Apparatus

The U.S. Naval Fleet has a need of 22 portable suction apparatus to be used in various circumstances and procedures, especially emergencies, throughout multiple ships. The suction apparatus must be rugged, portable and battery operated.  The batteries shall be capable of being recharged on a standard 110 VAC, 60Hz, 15 Amp outlet or 12 VDC power source.  The unit shall be protected utilizing a carrying case with strap.
 The carrying case shall allow the operator the ability to read the units gauges while in the case. The control mode switches and indictor lamps shall also be accessible and visible while contained in the carrying case. The suction unit shall be selectable between continuous 0- 550 mmHg and intermittent 0-220 mmHg modes and have selectable intervals from 5- 40 seconds in both the On and Off positions.  The unit shall incorporate a disposable suction container. The ships already have a stock level of consumables and durables which directly interface to an already existing stock of Impact 326M suction apparatus. It is essential the human factors that interface between these devices be identical as any variation inserts a probability of an operator error, which could easily result in unsuccessful outcomes.

If as a result of technical discussions it is desirable to alter/change contractual obligations or the Scope of Work, the Contracting Officer shall issue such changes.<br />52.24-403-70 Notice of Contractor Personnel Security Requirements (OCT 2005)<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.<br />1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005: <br />a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, " Employment Eligibility Verification, " and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level: <br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required; <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. <br />If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.<br />2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:<br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required; and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. <br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. <br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes: <br />FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />52.27-103-72 DOJ Contractor Residency Requirement (JUN 2004): For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under the contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have:<br />1. Legally resided in the United States (U.S.) ;<br />2. Worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity;<br />3. Been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.<br />If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S. The following website provided current information regarding allied countries:<br />http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizens.htm.<br />By signing this agreement/commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.<br />52.242-1502 Evaluation of Contractor Performance Utilizing CPARS (APR 2011) <br />The services, although not directly supervised, shall be reviewed by Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) staff to ensure contract compliance. The contractor's performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 42.15. Contract monitoring reports will be prepared by the Contacting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) or Contract Monitor (CM) and maintained in the contract file. <br />In accordance with FAR 42.1502 and 42.1503, agencies shall prepare an evaluation of contractor performance and submit it to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The BOP utilizes the Department of Defense (DOD) web-based Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to provide contractor performance evaluations. The contractor shall provide and maintain a current e-mail address throughout the life of the contract. The contractor will receive an e-mail from the Focal Point thru the following website address webptsmh@navy.milwhen the contract is registered in CPARS. The e-mail will contain a "user ID" and temporary password to register in the CPARS system. The contractor must be registered to access and review its evaluation and/or provide a response.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

<CONTACT>Pete LaVerghetta, Phone (215)737-7502, Fax (215)737-3684, Email Peter.Laverghetta@dla.mil
<DESC><p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK FOR TALC-REINFORCED POLYPROPYLENE FOR <br />POLY TRAY RETORT RACK REFORMULATION</p>
<p>Purpose: This Statement of Work (SOW) outlines a DLA Troop Support (DLA-TS) Subsistence Industrial Base Planning (IBP) Office project in conjunction with Texas A&amp;M University for the manufacturing of polymeric tray retort racks using a new formula. This SOW will serve as the definition of the requirement to seek proposals to make 300 new racks using the new formula.</p>
<p>Actions: The successful offeror will contact the contracting officer who will make arrangements with Texas A&amp;M to provide the formula. The completed racks will be shipped to the following three sites:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AMERIQUAL<br />18200 Highway 41 North<br />Evansville, IN 47725<br />POC: Dan Bittner, Vice President of Marketing and Sales<br />Email: dbittner@ameriqual.com<br />Direct: 812-867-1444<br /><br />WORNICK FOODS<br />4700 Creek Road<br />Cincinnati, OH 45242-2808<br />POC: Michael Hyche, Vice President, Operations<br />Email: Michael.hyche@wornick.com<br />Direct: 513-552-7410<br />Main: 513-552-7400<br />Fax: 513-552-7604</p>
<p>SOPAKCO<br />118 S. Cypress St.<br />Mullins, SC <br />POC: Dave DuBose, Vice President<br />Email: ddubose@sopakco.com<br />Direct: 843-464-7851</p>
<p><br />Responsibilities/Maintenance: The successful offeror will ensure that the color of the racks to be made under this RFP will be orange to distinguish them from racks currently in use at the three sites. The winning offeror will produce 300 each of the Talc-Reinforced Polypropylene Racks using the new formula. Once produced, a quantity of 100 racks will be shipped to each of the three test sites listed above. The delivery date for these racks will be mutually agreed upon between the successful offeror and the contracting officer after award and receipt of the formula from Texas A&amp;M. Additionally, upon award, DLA-TS will ship the molds for the racks to the facility of the successful offeror. Following the fulfillment of this requirement, DLA-TS will arrange for the shipment of the molds back to the storage location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Disclosure Agreement: Proprietary information must be protected at all times. The successful offeror will be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with the Government along with the test sites listed above.</p>
<p>Proposals: Proposals are due by 2:00 p.m. EST on Monday, September 10, 2012. <br /><br />Reverse Auction: <br />52.215-9023 Reverse Auction (JAN 2011) - DLAD</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply.</p>
<p>(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.</p>
<p>(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on-line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on-line auction process. The Government intends to use a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on-line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.</p>
<p>(d) Prior to the on-line auction, the Government will determine whether either all offerors' prices or just the lowest offeror's price(s) will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the on-line auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). If the Government opts to disclose one or more offerors' prices, only generic identifiers will be used for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A", or "lowest priced offeror"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(e) An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>(f) The following information is provided regarding the procedures to be followed if a reverse auction is conducted.</p>
<p>(1) Each offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by DLA's commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.</p>
<p>(2) In order for an Offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions for using its service. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service provider's terms and conditions is available at [https://govauctions.sourcing.ariba.com].</p>
<p>(3) Offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or the Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. Offerors shall keep their own and other offerors' pricing in confidence until after contract award.</p>
<p>(4) Any offeror unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider's system during a reverse auction must notify the Contracting Officer or designated representative Pete LaVerghetta (215) 737-7502 or by email to peter.laverghetta@dla.mil immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the offeror and outside the offeror's control.</p>
<p>(5) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website: [ https://govauctions.sourcing.ariba.com ]. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and Internet connection.</p>
<p>(6) Training:</p>
<p>(i) The commercial reverse auction service provider and/or a Government representative will provide familiarization training to offerors' employees; this training may be provided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider's website, and/or other means.</p>

<p>Purpose: This Statement of Work (SOW) outlines a DLA Troop Support (DLA-TS) Subsistence Industrial Base Planning (IBP) Office project in conjunction with Texas A&amp;M University for the manufacturing of polymeric tray retort racks using a new formula. This SOW will serve as the definition of the requirement to seek proposals to make 300 new racks using the new formula.</p>
<p>Actions: The successful offeror will contact the contracting officer who will make arrangements with Texas A&amp;M to provide the formula. The completed racks will be shipped to the following three sites:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AMERIQUAL<br />18200 Highway 41 North<br />Evansville, IN 47725<br />POC: Dan Bittner, Vice President of Marketing and Sales<br />Email: dbittner@ameriqual.com<br />Direct: 812-867-1444<br /><br />WORNICK FOODS<br />4700 Creek Road<br />Cincinnati, OH 45242-2808<br />POC: Michael Hyche, Vice President, Operations<br />Email: Michael.hyche@wornick.com<br />Direct: 513-552-7410<br />Main: 513-552-7400<br />Fax: 513-552-7604</p>
<p>SOPAKCO<br />118 S. Cypress St.<br />Mullins, SC <br />POC: Dave DuBose, Vice President<br />Email: ddubose@sopakco.com<br />Direct: 843-464-7851</p>
<p><br />Responsibilities/Maintenance: The successful offeror will ensure that the color of the racks to be made under this RFP will be orange to distinguish them from racks currently in use at the three sites. The winning offeror will produce 300 each of the Talc-Reinforced Polypropylene Racks using the new formula. Once produced, a quantity of 100 racks will be shipped to each of the three test sites listed above. The delivery date for these racks will be mutually agreed upon between the successful offeror and the contracting officer after award and receipt of the formula from Texas A&amp;M. Additionally, upon award, DLA-TS will ship the molds for the racks to the facility of the successful offeror. Following the fulfillment of this requirement, DLA-TS will arrange for the shipment of the molds back to the storage location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Disclosure Agreement: Proprietary information must be protected at all times. The successful offeror will be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with the Government along with the test sites listed above.</p>
<p>Proposals: Proposals are due by 2:00 p.m. EST on Tuesday July 3, 2012. <br /><br />Delivery is required on or before September 10, 2012.<br /><br />Reverse Auction: <br />52.215-9023 Reverse Auction (JAN 2011) - DLAD</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply.</p>
<p>(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.</p>
<p>(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on-line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on-line auction process. The Government intends to use a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on-line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.</p>
<p>(d) Prior to the on-line auction, the Government will determine whether either all offerors' prices or just the lowest offeror's price(s) will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the on-line auction.

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?	Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o	Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Synopsis:

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

The Decide module contains a questionnaire that must be completed by an officer of the company (President, VP, CEO, CFO, etc.) and must be submitted with your offer in order to gain consideration.

Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable Offeror whose proposal provides the greatest overall value to the Government, price and technical (non-cost) factors considered. This process permits tradeoffs among price and technical (non-cost) factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal.</p>
<p>II. EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>A. Technical (non-cost) Factors- Technical Approach is more important than company experience.</p>
<p>Factor 1- Technical Approach<br />Factor 2- Company Experience</p>

<p>III. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>A. Technical</p>
<p>Factor 1-Technical Approach</p>

This factor will be used to evaluate the degree to which the Offeror's proposed technical approach meets all requirements. The Offeror shall detail their plan to achieve the Government's requirements identified in the SOW. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's strengths, weaknesses and risks of the Offeror's technical approach in addressing the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Technical capability to provide the equipment within the specified time by providing equipment lists to include the make, model, and quantity available for the requested equipment.</p>
<p>&bull; Plan to ensure that the required equipment is provided although resources may be scarce as result of a disaster.</p>
<p>&bull; Quality control procedures to ensure that the equipment will be secured onsite or removed prior to a disaster to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Factor 2-Company Experience</p>
<p>Company experience will be evaluated on the basis of Offeror's relevant experience during the last three years. The government will evaluate each Offeror's corporate experience in providing services, which are of similar nature to the work to be performed under the requirement described in this solicitation. Specifically, jobs that are of similar scope, complexity, contract type, and period of performance, in relation to the requirements of this solicitation are of particular interest to the government. The Offeror shall provide summaries for relevant and recent projects. The summaries shall include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Contracting Agency (Company), address and phone number.<br />&bull; Point of contact name<br />&bull; Contract number and type of contract<br />&bull; Date of contract, period of performance, and place of performance<br />&bull; Project value<br />&bull; Describe the relevance to this requirement. It is not sufficient to merely state that a project is comparable in magnitude and scope. Rationale must be provided to convince the Government that a project is indeed similar.<br />In determining the rating for experience the Government will give greater consideration to the experience which is most relevant to the solicitation. The evaluation of experience will focus on the relevance, complexity, and scope of the noted experience. <br />The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions.

<p>The project area includes campground/trailheads located on Challis/Yankee Fork and Middle Fork Ranger Districts of the Salmon-Challis National Forest.

<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

<p><strong>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</strong></p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br /></strong>Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT: The contractor shall provide statistical analyses and expert consultation and evaluation of current methodologies that will enhance the usefulness of statistical analysis of single chemical and mixtures data. These analyses and evaluations shall be conducted for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  A major concern with regard to exposure to multiple chemicals from both a risk assessment and an environmental protection perspective is accurate assessment of the risk posed by exposure to chemical mixtures. The chemicals in a mixture may be additive (either dose-additive or response-additive) or the chemicals may interact in such a way to cause toxicity either greater or less than expected based on dose-additive or response-additive models. The majority of assessments of the additivity of mixtures are of defined mixtures with the expected effect of the mixture determined from single chemical data and an expectation of additivity. The purpose of this requirement is to obtain the analysis of single chemical and mixtures data and for evaluation of factors that may influence the ability to detect departure from additivity.  Over the past 5-10 years, multiple methods for analysis of mixtures data have been published.  The majority have been either for a) prediction, under an as sumption of dose-additivity, of the expected effect of a defined mixture from single-chemical dose-response curves or for b) estimation, under an assumption of dose addition and use of either relative potency factors (RPFs) or toxicity equivalent factors (TEFs) whether the estimated effect of the mixture exceeds an acceptable level of health risk. However, there has been essentially no consideration of factors that may determine the ability to detect deviations from additivity or how varied expression of dose might affect RPF or TEFs.   SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK: The contractor shall analyze single chemical and mixture data sets for consistency with dose additivity and identify factors that influence the ability to detect deviations from additivity and examine their impact.  The contractor shall focus on methods and techniques for prediction, under an assumption of either dose-additivity or response-additivity or another defined expectation of additivity, of the expected effect of a defined mixture from single-chemical dose-response curves or estimation of whether the expected effect of the mixture exceeds an acceptable level of health risk. The smallest number of chemicals in the mixture is two and the expected largest number of chemicals is seven to ten chemicals. Factors for possible consideration include whether the experimental design has sufficient statistical power to detect departure from additivity in the low dose/low response region,  how the severity or degree of departure from ad ditivity affects the ability to detect deviations from the default additivity assumption, how expressions of dosage affect the conclusion of additivity or nonadditivity,  how the degree of variability in the single chemical dose response curves affects the ability to detect departure from additivity, and how the fit of the curves to both the single chemical and the mixture data affect the ability to detect departure from additivity.   Consideration of impact of dose expression may include consideration of RPF and TEF risk assessment methodologies.    Possible factors for consideration include: the number of chemicals in the mixture; how the dose is expressed; the mixing ratio of the constituent chemicals in the mixture;  the placement of the single chemical dose levels on the single chemical dose-response curves relative to the placement of the mixture dose levels;  the variability contained in each single-chemical dose-response curve;  inclusion of mixture data in the addit ivity model; the variability in the single-chemical dose-response curves; the fit of the single chemical-dose response curves; and, the number of dose groups and the  (n) per dose group for both the single chemicals and the chemical mixtures. Upon completion of the analysis, the contractor shall prepare a draft a final report with the results of the analysis of up to three data sets identifying, examining and discussing key factors that affect the predictive nature of such models.  The draft report shall consider factors that affect the risk assessment application of the methods as well as factors that affect the ability to detect departure from additivity in experimental data sets. Upon EPA review and comments of the draft report the contractor shall submit the final report prior to the expiration date of the purchase order.  All data sets will be supplied by the U.S. upon award of purchase order.  Attachment 1 provides examples of the data to be supplied to the contractor.  US EPA RESPONSIBILITIES: 1.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT57-12-Q-80058 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-58, effective May 18, 2012. The NAICS Code is 335929; the Small Business size standard is 1,000 Employees.
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is supporting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the design and construction of new platforms, ladder safety systems, wiring and piles. The Volpe Center is seeking to acquire 3400 linear feet of new 4 conductor submarine cable for use requirement for these piles is described in detail in the Statement of Work (SOW) below.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK (Begin)</p>
<p>San Diego International Airport Runway 9 MALSR System Refurbishment Project</p>
<p>1.0 BACKGROUND<br />The FAA owns and maintains an approach lighting system (ALS) to Runway 9 at the San Diego International Airport. An ALS is a configuration of signal lights disposed symmetrically about the extended runway centerline, starting at the landing threshold and extending outward into the approach zone. This system provides pilots with visual information regarding runway alignment, height perception, roll guidance and horizon references. Specifically, the system is a Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System (MALS) with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights (RAIL), considered a MALSR in combination. The MALS consists of a threshold light bar and seven steady burning light bars spaced at 200-foot intervals along the extended runway centerline and extending out a distance of 1,400 feet from the Runway 9 threshold. The RAIL portion consists of five sequence flashers located on the extended runway centerline, the first being located after the last steady burning light station, with successive light stations located at 200-foot intervals out to approximately 2,400 feet from the runway threshold. All lights are aimed into the Runway 9 approach and away from the runway threshold. <br />MALSR Station 15+00 and each successive light station after that are supported on top of an elevated timber platform (see attached photos). Four of the platforms (Stations 15+00, 17+00, 19+00, 21+00) are located in a boat channel (the former mouth of the San Diego River and referred to on some maps as Navy Lagoon) and the last two stations (Stations 23+00 and 24+85) are located on land across the lagoon on elevated platforms as well within NTC Park, a recently-developed San Diego city park. Initially installed in 1982, the platforms at stations 15+00, 17+00, 19+00, 21+00 and six of the eight supporting timber piles at stations 17+00, 19+00, 21+00 have deteriorated to a point where the structural and operational integrity of the MALSR is in question. <br />FAA plans to make necessary repairs to the MALSR and bring the platforms into OSHA compliance. The proposed action is strictly maintenance-related and does not affect the existing functionality of the airport. To this end, the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is supporting the FAA in the design and construction of new platforms, ladder safety systems, wiring, and piles for the above mentioned stations. The purpose of this purchase requirement is for the Volpe Center to acquire 3400 linear feet of new 4 conductor submarine cable for use in this project.<br />2.0 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND REFERENCES<br />2.1 Applicable Regulations and Standards<br />In cases where standards and/or purchase order documents are conflicting or discrepancies occur, the more stringent requirement shall be followed and enforced.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <BR> <BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.
 
(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance. 
(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.
(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.
(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]
(5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may?
(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or
(B) Terminate this contract for cause.
(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the   Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. <BR> <BR>(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to?

<DESC><p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK FOR TALC-REINFORCED POLYPROPYLENE FOR <br />POLY TRAY RETORT RACK REFORMULATION</p>
<p>Purpose: This Statement of Work (SOW) outlines a DLA Troop Support (DLA-TS) Subsistence Industrial Base Planning (IBP) Office project in conjunction with Texas A&amp;M University for the manufacturing of polymeric tray retort racks using a new formula. This SOW will serve as the definition of the requirement to seek proposals to make 300 new racks using the new formula.</p>
<p>Actions: The successful offeror will contact the contracting officer who will make arrangements with Texas A&amp;M to provide the formula. The completed racks will be shipped to the following three sites:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AMERIQUAL<br />18200 Highway 41 North<br />Evansville, IN 47725<br />POC: Dan Bittner, Vice President of Marketing and Sales<br />Email: dbittner@ameriqual.com<br />Direct: 812-867-1444<br /><br />WORNICK FOODS<br />4700 Creek Road<br />Cincinnati, OH 45242-2808<br />POC: Michael Hyche, Vice President, Operations<br />Email: Michael.hyche@wornick.com<br />Direct: 513-552-7410<br />Main: 513-552-7400<br />Fax: 513-552-7604</p>
<p>SOPAKCO<br />118 S. Cypress St.<br />Mullins, SC <br />POC: Dave DuBose, Vice President<br />Email: ddubose@sopakco.com<br />Direct: 843-464-7851</p>
<p><br />Responsibilities/Maintenance: The successful offeror will ensure that the color of the racks to be made under this RFP will be orange to distinguish them from racks currently in use at the three sites. The winning offeror will produce 300 each of the Talc-Reinforced Polypropylene Racks using the new formula. Once produced, a quantity of 100 racks will be shipped to each of the three test sites listed above. The delivery date for these racks will be mutually agreed upon between the successful offeror and the contracting officer after award and receipt of the formula from Texas A&amp;M. Additionally, upon award, DLA-TS will ship the molds for the racks to the facility of the successful offeror. Following the fulfillment of this requirement, DLA-TS will arrange for the shipment of the molds back to the storage location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Disclosure Agreement: Proprietary information must be protected at all times. The successful offeror will be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with the Government along with the test sites listed above.</p>
<p>Proposals: Proposals are due by 2:00 p.m. EST on Tuesday July 3, 2012.<br /><br />Product delivery is required on or before September 10, 2012.<br /><br />Reverse Auction: <br />52.215-9023 Reverse Auction (JAN 2011) - DLAD</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply.</p>
<p>(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.</p>
<p>(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on-line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on-line auction process. The Government intends to use a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on-line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.</p>
<p>(d) Prior to the on-line auction, the Government will determine whether either all offerors' prices or just the lowest offeror's price(s) will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the on-line auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). If the Government opts to disclose one or more offerors' prices, only generic identifiers will be used for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A", or "lowest priced offeror"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(e) An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>(f) The following information is provided regarding the procedures to be followed if a reverse auction is conducted.</p>
<p>(1) Each offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by DLA's commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.</p>
<p>(2) In order for an Offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions for using its service. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service provider's terms and conditions is available at [https://govauctions.sourcing.ariba.com].</p>
<p>(3) Offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or the Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. Offerors shall keep their own and other offerors' pricing in confidence until after contract award.</p>
<p>(4) Any offeror unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider's system during a reverse auction must notify the Contracting Officer or designated representative Pete LaVerghetta (215) 737-7502 or by email to peter.laverghetta@dla.mil immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the offeror and outside the offeror's control.</p>
<p>(5) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website: [ https://govauctions.sourcing.ariba.com ]. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and Internet connection.</p>
<p>(6) Training:</p>
<p>(i) The commercial reverse auction service provider and/or a Government representative will provide familiarization training to offerors' employees; this training may be provided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider's website, and/or other means.</p>
<p>(ii) An employee of an offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a 'trained offeror.' Only trained offerors may participate in a reverse auction. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that offerors provide an alternate offeror employee to become a 'trained offeror.' The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the 'trained offeror' designation from any trained offeror who fails to abide by the solicitation's or commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions.</p>

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?	Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o	Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>Access to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) requires that Contractor employees voluntarily submit personal data (e.g., name, social security number, etc.) when applying for a DPG Identification Card or temporary access pass.  This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.

It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground is located in a remote area.  The main gate is approximately 90 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah.  Contractors may be required to travel up to 150 miles one way from Salt Lake City to reach some work sites. <BR> <BR>Contractors with valid U.S. government contracts will be allowed to hire non U.S. citizens to work at or visit U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during performance of the contract.

A list of foreign national employees shall be provided to the DPG Counterintelligence, Law Enforcement, and Security Offices at least five (5) working days prior to arrival on post.  A copy of  the list shall also be submitted to the Contracting Officer or an appointed Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR).  The list will contain name, nationality, green card and social security number, date of birth, drivers license number and state where issued. The Contractor shall also list the date(s) foreign nationals will be on post.  If a sensitive test or visit is scheduled during the dates provided, the Counterintelligence Office will inform the Contractor whether the work/visit may take place.   Employees will not be allowed on Post until verification process is complete.  Once verification has been received, the Counterintelligence Office is responsible to provide the Protocol Office the following information for badge preparation:  Name, Company and Point-of-Contact.  The Contracting Officer or COR will be responsible to pick-up the badges and holders, issue them to the visitor and return them at the end of the visit. <BR> <BR>Questions concerning this buy must be submitted at least 2 days prior to the established closing date to reasonably expect a response from the Government.

The Contractor shall take all reasonable steps and precautions to prevent accidents, and preserve and protect personnel and property.

Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor.  It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>Access to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) requires that Contractor employees voluntarily submit personal data (e.g., name, social security number, etc.) when applying for a DPG Identification Card or temporary access pass.  This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground. Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor.  It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>(a)	In accordance with Section 326 of P.L. 102-484, the Government is prohibited from awarding any contract which includes a specification or standard that requires the use of a Class I ozone-depleting substance (ODS) identified in Section 602(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 767a(a)), or that can be met only through the use of such a substance unless such use has been approved, on an individual basis, by a senior acquisition official who determines that there is no suitable substitute available. (b)	To comply with this statute, the Government has conducted a best efforts screening of the specifications and standards associated with this acquisition to determine whether they contain any ODS requirements.  To the extent that ODS requirements were revealed by this review, they are identified in Section C or the statement of work of this document. (c)	If offerors possess any special knowledge about any other ODS required directly or indirectly at any level of contract performance, the U.S. Army would appreciated if such information was surfaced to the Contracting Officer for appropriate action.  To preclude delay to the procurement, offerors should provide any information as soon as possible after release of the solicitation and prior to the submission of offers to the extent practicable.  It should be understood that there is no obligation on offerors to comply with this request and that no compensation can be provided for doing so. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

The main gate is approximately 90 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah.  Contractors may be required to travel up to 150 miles one way from Salt Lake City to reach some work sites. <BR> <BR>Contractors with valid U.S. government contracts will be allowed to hire non U.S. citizens to work at or visit U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during performance of the contract.

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?

Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The Micro Motion Meter Parts Project was advertised  April 23, 2012 and closed May 24, 2012.  The advertisement resulted in three respondents.  None of the respondents have fully met the requirements defined in the solicitation.  One was not responsive to the solicitation in that their bid included additional work that was not requested and there was no ability to remove the non-required work from the bid.  The remaining two offers had prices that were far above the government's competitive range.  The government's competitive range was established through a market search/review.  The prices were obtained from commercial fabricators, distributors, and sole proprietors.  Therefore the review team recommends that no award be made.  The Government will re-evaluate its acquisition strategy.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the April 2012 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-58. This acquisition is a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541690. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. This is a labor hour contract.
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM), Specialized Information Services (SIS) has a requirement to create new content, enhance existing content, and procure support for content building activities for the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management (CHEMM) Website. The award will be for a Base Year with options for two (2) successive one-year periods. The CHEMM tool is designed to provide access to comprehensive sets of information via a user-friendly interface. The users include first responders, first receivers, other health care providers, and planners. CHEMM allows these users to plan, respond, recover, and mitigate the effects of incidents involving chemicals. CHEMM's unique content covers information especially relevant to chemical exposure-related mass casualty and "unusual" scenarios. CHEMM's expert interface will link users to resources from other organizations, e.g., U.S. EPA/NOAA (CAMEO tools), the CDC's Emergency Preparedness and Response Web site and NIOSH Emergency Response Safety and Health Database (ERSH-DB), the chemical industry's CHEMTREC service, poison control centers, etc. Like NIH's WISER (Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders) and REMM (Radiation Emergency Medical Management), CHEMM is available on the Internet for online use on computers and handheld devices, and also for download so that it can be used in an emergency even without an Internet connection. A Smartphone app for CHEMM is also under development.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROCUREMENT<br />The contractor shall work with CHEMM subject matter experts and the NLM COTR to perform tasks associated with data extraction from source reference materials approved by NLM to enhance and update topical pages for the CHEMM Website. In addition, the contractor shall conduct quality control (technical accuracy of CHEMM information extracted/summarized from other sources) and editing checks on the content of the<br />CHEMM Website.</p>
<p>The contractor shall also select references and Web links to Internet resources for use in CHEMM based on NLM-provided selection criteria and provide comments on possible enhancement of the selection criteria.</p>
<p>Task 1. Create new content for CHEMM in easy Web-readable style, by extracting/summarizing data from NLM approved reference materials. The content should be written for easily readable style for the Web.</p>
<p>Contractor will submit on average one new content item per month. The average word count of such content is 500 words per item. The file format for delivery is customarily in Word format. Traditionally, the contractor has delivered the new content via email and email attachments.</p>
<p>Once a new content item is assigned to the contractor, typically the contractor will be required to submit the first draft in about 20 work days. Normally, there will be only one submission of a revised draft and it is due within about 10 working days. Typically, the contractor will have 5 working days to finalize the draft revision.</p>
<p>Task 2. Enhance, update, and revise current topical content.</p>
<p>Task 3. Select references and Web links to Internet resources for inclusion in CHEMM Website, and provide comments on possible enhancement of the selection criteria.</p>
<p>NLM-approved reference materials will be selected by the Library's subject matter experts. The contractor will typically have direct access via web site links to the NLM-approved reference materials. Sometimes, the contractor will receive printed copies of the reference materials and/or will rarely need to go to the local library for a printed copy.</p>
<p>Task 4. Support content building activities such as facilitating peer consultation and peer review meetings, pending on availability of funding</p>
<p>508 COMPLIANCE<br />THE&nbsp;SECTION ON&nbsp;508 COMPLIANCE&nbsp;PERTAINS ONLY TO THE MONTHLY&nbsp;REPORTING REQUIREMENTS&nbsp;IN THE STATEMENT OF WORK.<br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires agencies' electronic and information technology be accessible to people with disabilities. The CHEMM data must be Section 508 compliant. Specifically, the end product must be conformant with all applicable provisions, including:<br /><br />1194.41 Information, documentation, and support<br />(Only complete this portion of the attached GPAT.)</p>
<p>These provisions can be found at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm<br /><br />Section 508 Program Need<br />Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for the following program need: content for CHEMM website.<br /><br />Technical standards from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart B have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those technical provisions identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).<br /><br />Functional performance criteria from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart C have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those functional performance criteria identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).<br /><br />Section 508 Evaluation Factors<br />Responses to the solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed GPAT, VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.<br /><br />Section 508 Acceptance Criteria<br />The web site design project deliverables as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility. The proposals for the CHEMM project must include a GPAT, a sample of which is included as a part of the solicitation.<br />All resulting electronic files and reports delivered by the contractor will become the property of the Government.<br />The electronic files and reports delivered by the contractor will be reviewed and approved for acceptance by the Project Officer upon delivery by the contractor.<br /><br />EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />After satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility, the evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the perspective vendors to meet the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work. Prospective vendors must submit information sufficient to allow NLM to evaluate based on the stated criteria. <br /><br />Content and technical factors are of paramount consideration; however, cost is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. The Government can make tradeoffs among cost and technical factors in determining which Offeror(s) provide the best value by awarding to other than the lowest cost Offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated Offeror(s). Offeror(s) are advised that award will be made to that Offeror(s) whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Agency's best value determination includes assessments by reviewers with a thorough knowledge of the CHEMM program to evaluate each quote&nbsp;based on the response to the evaluation criteria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Quoters are advised that each quotation may be subjected to a price analysis, as determined to be appropriate by the Government.</p>
<p>In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes:<br /><br />Criterion A: Understanding the Requirements and Technical Approach (40 points)<br />The contractor shall provide a written proposal demonstrating an understanding of the purpose and intent of the task order requirements through a comprehensive description of the proposed approach; and describe procedures to ensure that the project timeline will be met. The proposal demonstrates sufficient contractor experience and knowledge to assure rapid execution of tasks. All proposed staff shall be approved by the SIS Project Officer to ensure that skills and experience are sufficient for the requirements of specific, assigned tasks.</p>
<p>Criterion B: Corporate Experience and Personnel (35 points)<br />This criterion will be evaluated based on the description of the organization, personnel and project experience. The proposal should include a detailed description of the organization. The experience of the personnel should be outlined. Detailed information describing the facilities and resources the organization has to carry out the tasks of the project should also be included.

<DESC><p>Request for Information</p>
<p>Q- Request for clarification regarding coatings for this project. Could you please help us understand the anodizing/coating requirements for this project. I see the notes that state what the coating requirement should be but I have unable to identify where they are referenced on the prints themselves. For example, on drawing X9484991, note number 11 it states, "PRETREAT ALL SURFACES WITH ANODIC COATING (FIND NO. 16). PRIMER (FIND NO. 17) AND PAINT (FIND NO. 18) IAW MIL-STD 808, TYPE 1, FINISH CODE F-400, PAINT COLOR (CAMOUFLAGE GREEN) IAW FED-STD-595". I am unable to find these numbers on the subsequent drawings.</p>
<p>A- MIL-SPEC paint and primer is what needs to be done to the test stand.</p>

<DESC><p>THERE ARE NO FUNDS AGAINST THE BAA SOLICITATION. The U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center's XR Functional Capabilities Integration program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) identifies scientific and technical areas of interest for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. This BAA is conducted using full and open competition. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this BAA is presumed to be 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. Although no portion of this BAA has been set aside for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, historically underutilized business zone businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and/or minority institutions, participation from all these organizations is highly encouraged. In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper. Offerors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal. Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process. A proposal's technical evaluation and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award. Cost reasonableness shall also be considered. Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 30 September 2012. This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 October 2012. The BAA technical areas of interest are for capabilities integration research work in the following areas: predictive battlespace awareness, information display and visualization, airborne networking, sensor systems and execution, data fusion and edge devices, information assurance and security, information management, cyberspace technologies, and other miscellaneous capability integration technologies. All questions may be directed to the technical contact points listed in Section V of the BAA.</p>

Please to dont click on the link for HERBB, that is no longer valid. The BAA is attached to FedBizopps now.

The Davis Dam water treatment system is located one level below the transformer deck on the south end deck (downstream side).  There is an access hatch on the transformer deck that provides direct access to the water treatment system room.  Currently, Davis Dam utilizes a gas chlorination system that is located in a hazardous materials room on top of the transformer deck.  The gas chlorine feeds into the water filtration system located on the lower level below the transformer deck.  Davis Dam is looking at installing a new water treatment system which should eliminate gas chlorine and intends to stay away from liquid chlorine due to storage issues from the temperature.  Roadway to transformer deck: Two lane 12 foot wide lane.  Proper security measures will need to be taken for contractor access to Davis Dam facilities. Dimensions Water Treatment Room: 28' X 35' Drawings & Photographs 351-D-735 (Plan View Plant Layout) 351-D- XXXX (Pipe and Tank Layout) 351-D-1623 (Water Supply Lines) 351-D-2141 (Plan View Plant Layout) 	 1.

<DESC>The All Source Positioning and Navigation (ASPN) program seeks to enable low cost, robust, and seamless navigation solutions for military users on any operational platform and in any environment, with or without GPS. In particular, ASPN will develop the architectures, abstraction methods, and navigation filtering algorithms needed for rapid integration and reconfiguration of any combination of sensors. This will enable rapid adaptation to evolving missions as well as reduction of the system integration costs and time-to-market for navigation solutions in general. Phase 2 will result in real-time algorithms fielded on SWaP-representative prototype hardware that will accept an arbitrary set of inputs, regardless of native application of the sensors used, with robustness and quick re-convergence as sensors and measurements are introduced to or removed from the navigation system.

<DESC>Amendment Number 004 (June 12, 2012).<br /><br />The purpose of this amendment&nbsp;is to provide the following responses to vendor questions:<br /><br />1)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp; P. 4 of the RFP states that the pricing schedules for the categories shall contain loaded hourly rates for each labor category and shall be fully burdened to include wages, indirect costs (including local travel), fringe benefits, overhead, general and administrative, and profit. P.2 Section 1.3. Overview of Pricing Schedules states that task orders may be Fixed Price, Time &amp; Materials, or Labor Hour contract types. May the offeror provide separate category rate schedules for each contract type? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; Yes; however, the Government may follow-up with clarifying questions, if necessary, after proposals are received.<br /><br />2)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;The ID/IQ Pricing Tables on p. 3 of the RFP do not allow for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) such as non-local travel, purchased materials and services, subject incentives, subcontractors, etc. However, p. 42 states the offeror shall also provide pricing for any applicable ODCs as well as non local travel. Is it the intent of the Government for ODCs to be proposed on a task-by-task basis and not at the ID/IQ level? If we are to propose ODCs at the ID/IQ level, should they be proposed as a separate line item as shown on p. 42? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; Please propose ODCs on a task-by-task basis<br /><br />3)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;P. 41 Section 11.6.2 Pricing Approach states that the Offeror shall use the following pricing templates for the submission of their pricing proposals: FDA IDIQ Pricing.xls: The Offeror shall use Sample 1 below and this pricing template for the submission of their IDIQ pricing schedule. Would the government please provide the Excel pricing template? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; There is no actual template - the sample is simply a sample. Offerors may use whatever format they feel is most informative.<br /><br />4)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructions under 11.6 Volume 3 - Business Proposal pp. 41-42 state that Table 1 should be used to for the submission of the ID/IQ pricing schedule. Table 1 has a column for Estimated Hours. Is that column to be completed for the ID/IQ level or only for Task Order -1? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; Task Order One<br /><br />5)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alternative Line Items": The RFP on page 4 states that additional labor categories may be added through modifications. As the contractor shall provide a firm-fixed price per labor category proposal for the IDIQ period of performance of this contract, the RFP also states on page 41, the Offeror may also propose additional labor categories if deemed necessary and appropriate for the work to be performed on the IDIQ proposal, in addition to proposing additional labor categories on Task Order 1 as stated in 11.6.3, may the Offeror propose additional labor categories on the IDIQ pricing schedule? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; Yes; however, the Government may follow-up with clarifying questions, if necessary, after proposals are received.<br /><br />6)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7.9 requires a Confidentiality Agreement to be signed by each employee/subcontractor employee prior to accessing Government information. Would FDA please clarify that FORM FDA 3398 is sufficient for this purpose? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; Yes, the FDA 3398 is sufficient for this purpose.<br /><br />7)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;The &lsquo;Reports and Deliverables' table in Section 5.2 on page 8 of the solicitation does not seem to accommodate for what can be a lengthy OMB approval process or FDA's Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC) approval process in the timeline. Please clarify. <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; FDA understands that this can be a lengthy process. The timeline may be modified to accommodate OMB requirements.<br /><br />8)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the subject opportunity required to receive approval from FDA's Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC)? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; This is not the responsibility of the Contractor.<br /><br />9)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Please clarify whether one or separate business volumes are required for the ID/IQ and the Task Order. <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; Please submit separate business proposal volumes for the ID/IQ and the Task Order.<br /><br />10)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Please confirm whether CVs in the appendix need to adhere to the font size and margin requirements of the technical proposal. <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; CVs do not need to adhere to the font size and margin requirements; however, please limit them to 2 pages each.<br />
<p>11)&nbsp;&nbsp;Would FDA consider staggering the due date for this opportunity in consideration of the multiple FDA RFPs released with the exact same due date? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; The proposal due date is extended to June 29, 2012.<br /><br />12)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7.9 requires a Confidentiality Agreement to be signed by each employee/subcontractor employee prior to accessing Government information. Would FDA please clarify that FORM FDA 3398 is sufficient for this purpose? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; Repeated question (please see #6 above).<br /><br />13)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Please confirm if deliverables must be in SAS or is a file that has been translated by another software program into a SAS transport (.xpt) format sufficient. <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; As long as the data can be manipulated/analyzed by FDA using SAS, the .xpt format is acceptable<br /><br />14)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the FDA please clarify if biospecimen samples can be shipped internationally for analysis purposes? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; Yes, this is acceptable.</p>
<p>15)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12.8 Subcontracting Plan contains directions to include dollars and percentages for each socio-economic category. Under an IDIQ where the exact nature and dollar value of the tasks to be issued is unknown initially, the ability to express dollars is extremely challenging. Would FDA allow the offeror to express subcontracting goals in terms of percentages only in the subcontracting plan? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; Yes<br /><br />16)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we are not diagnosing, treating or preventing any tobacco-related conditions, is a CLIA certified laboratory absolutely required for analysis of biological samples? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; The RFP has the study description as a "human subjects study with multiple blood draws following controlled exposure to a TP with....measurement of physiological responses during exposure." This statement acknowledges that laboratory monitoring is necessary to ensure human safety against the potential for toxic exposures and adverse events. Therefore, clinical decision-making is exercised based on these laboratory results. CLIA certification is needed.<br /><br />17)&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you please clarify if data collection for the Task Order needs to be conducted in a CLIA certified clinical site? <br /><br />GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:&nbsp; Yes, data collection needs to be conducted in a CLIA certified clinical site.<br /><br /><br />Additionally, the proposal due date is hereby extended from Friday, June 15, 2012 to Friday, June 29, 2012, 1:00 pm ET.</p>

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute anticipates that request for proposals (RFP) NHLBI-HV-12-08 will be available on or about March 31, 2011. The objective of the RFP is to continue Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Vector Production Core Laboratory (AAVCL) activities, which are part of the Gene Therapy Resource Program (GTRP), for five years. The purpose of the GTRP is to facilitate the translation of basic research in gene therapy to clinical application in the areas of heart, lung, and blood diseases. The GTRP provides resources in the areas of preclinical and clinical-grade vector production in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and in the conduct of pharmacology/toxicology studies. In addition, the GTRP provides funds and regulatory assistance to investigators wishing to conduct gene therapy clinical trials. The GTRP consists of a clinical coordinating center that oversees and coordinates the logistics of the core laboratories and provides regulatory assistance for clinical trials; a preclinical-grade vector production core laboratory; a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for adeno-associated virus (AAV); a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for lentivirus; and a pharmacology/toxicology core laboratory. The AAVCL will continue to 1) participate in the Steering Committee (SC) and subcommittees, as necessary, and attend SC meetings and participate in teleconferences, 2) provide, maintain, and update a Manual of Procedures (MOP), 3) develop, in collaboration with the SC, a customer satisfaction survey for investigators to evaluate the quality and acceptability of the product and timeliness of the service provided, 4) develop, in collaboration with the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), maintain, and update a secure, password protected web site page and provide updates to the CCC as needed, 5) produce scalable clinical grade adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), as defined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and applicable Federal and State regulations, for use by NHLBI-funded investigators, 6) prepare and ship vectors, in accordance with the MOP and Federal and State guidelines, upon completion of GMP production and testing, 7) maintain product-related inventories in a secure and confidential manner, 8) monitor facilities to ensure quality control of vector production and accuracy and completeness of production data, and maintain and make available for review, as necessary, records of monitoring activities, and 9) prepare materials for and participate in site visits to the contractor's facilities and ensure that up-to-date versions of all required certifications, inspections, and assurances are available for review during site visits.
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP) and, although one award is anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. A five-year "Cost-Reimbursement-Completion" type contract with a "Multi-year" FAR 17.1 funding mechanism, is being considered for this requirement. The ultimate contract type and funding mechanism will be determined by the NHLBI, based on what best fits the GTRP program goals and the available funding. The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://fedbizopps.gov. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. It is also offerors' responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any amendments to the RFP. Letters of intent to submit a proposal for the RFP are due no later than May 28, 2011. This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541711.&nbsp; NO ACTION REQUIRED FOR THIS NOTICE.</p>

  The contractor is expected to have surge capacity due to flex in operational schedules of the Navy.  On short notice, either ship could require repair/maintenance and the contractor would be expected to be able to support that effort Management responsiveness is essential for success of this program.  What is your companys strategy for surge/emergent requirements?

10.	Integration.  Integration strategy is a key role of the prime contractor.  The prime contractor is expected to work with many different vendors, subcontractors and customers to ensure a successful CNO Availability through sound Engineering practices, technical expertise and PM.  All work must be properly scheduled and managed.
  The contractor needs to have a sound plan for managing subcontracts as well.  What is your companys integration strategy, especially in regard to managing subcontractors?

11.	Accounting Methodology.  Sound financial tools and practices such as a certified accounting system, interface/approval with DCAA and approved purchasing systems are required to adequately provide proper billing to the Navy.  The accounting system would show the breakout of direct, indirect and overhead charges.  In addition, the accounting system would be used to manage the business with vendors as required.  While it is important to have an integrated schedule; it is equally important to have cost controls in place.
  The contractor will submit timely invoices/vouchers to the Navy by Contract Line Item (CLIN), Contract Subline Item (SLIN), and ACRN level.  Cost of performance shall be segregated, accumulated, and invoiced to the appropriate ACRN categories.  What certified accounting system and other best practice accounting methodology does your company currently use?

12.	Logistic Support/Sustainment.  The prime contractor needs to understand Logistic Support/Sustainment.  All repairs, maintenance and modernization have Integrated Logistic Support (ILS).  This means the ship and Navy receives the proper technical documents after upgrades have occurred and respond accurately and timely to the volume of Contractor Data Requirements List (CDRLs).
  What is your companys experience with ILS?

<DESC>The synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is a single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access the information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.   

Modification 0002 is being issued to answer questions received concerning the subject synopsis.  

Question 1:  The solicitation is listed on the FBO as a "pre"solicitation, however due dates are set and reset per mod.
 Shall I assume that this is no longer a presolicitation?
Answer 1:  The Request for Quotation (RFQ) with the Statement of Work (SOW) that was posted is the only information that is needed.  Submit your quote in accordance with the SOW and reference the synopsis number.

Question 2:  Our company is a small business concern that manufacturers power conversion equipment such as frequency converters, we do not manufacturer transformers as large as those in the subject solicitation. Can we bid only on the frequency converter?
 Answer 2:  All or None

Question 3:  Regarding remote control to turn on & off: Are we to take that to mean an inhibit circuit of the output is OK here, whereby user can inhibit output at will to control power on/off to the load? Or does this mean something else? This is a cost driver so it is imperative to specifically define what is meant here.
 
Answer 3:  It must have a remote control to turn on & off the input.  

Question 4:  Over/under voltage alarm: Is that for input, or for output? 
Answer 4:  Over/under voltage needs to be on both  - input and output.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement for RFIJ Systems. The RFIJ system hardware simulates or replicates actual threat jamming waveforms of existing and emerging threat open air jamming systems which are available world-wide. These jamming waveforms are targeted against United States (US) armed forces and their voice communications, data transmissions and Global Positioning System (GPS) signals.  <br><br>The Red Force Injection Jammer (RFIJ) systems provide threat signal capabilities to be used for developmental and operational field testing against emerging Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems.  In addition, they can be used to train and provide mission-rehearsal capabilities in dealing with threat electronic attack (EA) warfare in a re-created radio frequency (RF) communications environment including Global Position System (GPS) and commercial cell phone traffic for Army and Joint commanders and their staffs during war, conflict, or peacetime.  When used in the EA warfare manner, the systems developed under the RFIJ provide the capability for military operators to experience real threat signal effects during EA conditions on DoD communications and GPS systems.  The RFIJ systems can support the planning, decision-making and operational execution of unit commanders and their staffs from platoon through brigade level.  The system has been designed and built using modern computer technology, modern hardware and software engineering techniques and has validated threat waveforms that will allow units to operate at any test range or to train worldwide for realistic results of threat EA warfare.<br><br>The RFIJ is envisioned as a means to build operationally relevant threat representations for use in the live, virtual and constructive EW environment.  This includes a suite of Electronic Attack (EA) threat representation capabilities for both open air transmitters and novel injection jamming devices, with virtual and constructive simulator analogs Also included is the operating software required for the development and fielding of the RFIJ Systems with other threat efforts directly related to or that incorporates or support EA, Electronic Surveillance (ES) and Electronic Protection (EP) in the EW environment.  Requirements have been documented in the TSMO Program Objective Memorandum (POM) submission for FY12 through FY17.<br><br>The RFIJ Systems provide threat signal capabilities to be used for developmental and operational field testing against emerging DoD weapon systems.  In addition, the systems can be used to train and provide mission-rehearsal capabilities in dealing with threat EA warfare in a re-created communications environment for Army and Joint commanders and their staffs during war, conflict, or peacetime.  When used in the EA warfare manner, the systems produced under the RFIJ Systems contract will provide the capability for military operators to experience real threat signal effects during EA conditions on DoD communications and Global Position System (GPS) systems.  The RFIJ Systems can support the planning decision-making and operational execution of unit commanders and their staffs from platoon through brigade level.  These systems have been developed using modern computer technology, modern hardware and software engineering techniques and have validated threat waveforms that will allow units to operate at any test range or to train worldwide for realistic results of threat EA warfare.<br><br>RFIJ Systems currently have three major components comprising its key jamming functions.  They are as follows:<br><br>1.	Control Signal Transmitter (CST):  An electronics device that broadcasts signals (30 to 3000 MHz) that activates and directs both the Remote Jamming Unit (RJU) and Advanced GPS Jammer (AGPSJ) injection jammer units attached to the Systems Under Test (SUT) scattered across the test range.  The CST is positioned on a test range just as live jamming assets would be; however, instead of broadcasting actual jamming waveforms, the device transmits (Federal Communications Commission allowed) un-restricted control tones.  These tones are received by the RJU and/or AGPSJ devices attached to the SUTs. These "injection jammers" then translate the control tones received into pre-programmed commands and commences insert or "inject" these pre-programmed threat waveforms into the SUT.  This is what is referred to as "Injection Jamming."  <br><br>2.	Five-Channel Remote Jamming Unit (RJU):  A small low power electronics package in a rugged metal case that simultaneously produces up to four separate threat representative jamming signals (30 to 3000 MHz) used against voice and data transmissions which the RJU inserts (or injects) into the SUT directly into the receiver circuitry.  This process mimics the effect of using a live, open-air jammer, but eliminates the unintended consequences associated with such live jamming into the atmosphere.  It also incorporates the ability to inject GPS threat jamming signals on both the GPS L1 and L2 frequencies (1227.6 to 1575.42 MHz) into those test systems with GPS reception. This, in turn denies, disrupts or distorts the true GPS signal transmissions.  The 5-Channel RJU is an open air receiver only.  It will be inserted into the electrical path between the antenna and the receiver circuitry of the radio under test.  However, it does inject a very low power jamming signal onto the path leading into the receiver circuitry of the radio under test.  This "injected" signal is not sent to the antenna and is not transmitted into the atmosphere<br><br>3.	Two-Channel Remote Jamming Unit (RJU):  Is a miniature low power electronics package that is emplaced in a surrogate Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert (ESAPI) a bullet-proof breastplate placed in the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) an Interceptor Body Armor vest worn by dismounted soldiers in battle.  The RJU can simultaneously produce up to two separate threat representative jamming signals (30 to 3000 MHz) used against voice and data transmissions which the RJU inserts (or injects) into the SUT directly into the receiver circuitry.  This process mimics the effect of using a live, open-air jammer, but eliminates the unintended consequences associated with such live jamming into the atmosphere.   This unit is to be used in conjunction with small, tactical radios worn by dismounted soldiers.<br><br>This procurement shall be a 100% SET-ASIDE for SMALL BUSINESS.

Requisite amendments forthcoming.  Update 2: Bidders' questions submisstion window extended from 23 May 2012 to 11 June 2012 at 1700.  Please submit in accordance with orginal submission guidance prescribed below.  Update 1: See Amendment 0001 & Related Attachments - 06/01/2012  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) on behalf of the Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) program office (PMW 205) has issued Request for Proposal (RFP) number N00039-12-R-0009 for the procurement of the Next Generation Enterprise Network's Transport and Enterprise Services requirements. The Department of the Navy (DON) operates one of the largest intranets in the world, the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI).  NMCI provides end-to-end secure Information Technology (IT) services to more than 400,000 seats and 800,000 users, across 2,500+ USN and USMC locations that vary from major bases to single user locations.   NMCI has been operated under the programmatic and operational oversight of the DON until the end of the contract period of performance, September 30, 2010.  On October 1, 2010, the DON transitioned to the NMCI Continuity of Services Contract (CoSC), for the continued delivery of NMCI services to the DON, through April 30, 2014 (if all options are exercised).  The DON intends to transition IT services from CoSC to the follow-on Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) contract(s). The primary goals of NGEN are to: 1) operate the NMCI network while maintaining delivery of NMCI network and computing services; 2) support the NMCI network and associated computing services from requirement identification to service disposal; 3) ensure continued security of the network and proactive enhancement of information assurance (IA) capabilities to meet evolving and emerging threats; 4) provide Government Command and Control (C2) to ensure flexible and responsive operation and defense of the network; 5) leverage DoD enterprise security services provided by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to meet user requirements as technically and fiscally feasible and approved by the Designated Approving Authority (DAA); and 6) maintain continuity of service during transition from NMCI CoSC to follow-on NGEN contract(s) or Government operation. The Government anticipates firm fixed price, indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for the Transport and Enterprise Services requirements.  Award will be made to the offeror or combination of offerors that results in the lowest total combined price to the Government for the transition to, and operation and maintenance of the Next Generation Enterprise Network. The basic contract will establish minimum and maximum ordering amounts. The prospective contract will have a one-year base period with four one-year options.  This is a full and open competition. With the exception of attachments J-18, J-27, J-28, J-38 and J-43, this RFP has been released with all supporting attachments.  Hardcopies of documents will not be provided. Do to the proprietary nature of J-18, J-27, J-28, J-38 and J- 43 these attachments have been posted to the NGEN MITRE Technical Data site located at: https://partners.mitre.org/sites/NEN_TXS_RFP_GOV_TECH_DOC/NGEN_Technical_ DATA/default.aspx MITRE, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), is providing a secure server to host the NGEN applicable documents and technical data.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, New York Water Science Center(NWSC) has a requirement to modify an existing stream-gaging station to raise the equipment above recent flood levels.  The existing wooden shelter attached to the top of a poured concrete stilling well shall be removed.  The concrete stilling well will be extended six feet higher with masonry block and a new masonry block shelter built atop the extended stilling well.  A new walkway with handrails will also need to be fabricated, delivered, and installed to allow access to the new shelter. Some stream-gaging stations in the Schoharie Creek basin were inundated by flood waters during the August 28, 2011 flood (Tropical Storm Irene).  The USGS seeks to raise these structures approximately six feet to maximize the probability that these gages will remain functional during future flooding events. Wooden  shelter at the USGS stream-gaging station (01351500) Schoharie Creek at Burtonsville, NY, shall be completely removed from concrete well and new shelter shall be built to extend six feet higher than the current shelter (new shelter height will be approx. 14 ft. tall  see attachment J 3 photo).  New concrete block shelter construction shall include a new steel door with heavy duty pad lock hasp and walkway to access  with handrails. All labor, materials, and other associated costs are under the scope of this requirement and are the responsibility of the contractor.  The USGS will remove and replace hydrologic monitoring equipment from gage structure

See 'Obtaining Solicitation Documents' below.<br>_______________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Project Description:  (Approx. quantities)<br><br>The project is for Building 210 is a C-130 aircraft maintenance shop and admin facility for the 302nd Airlift Wing on Peterson AFB.<br><br>The project consists of making various large-scale repairs throughout the building consisting of architectural, mechanical and electrical work. The locker rooms, restrooms and offices between hangar bays are poorly configured, resulting in inefficient space use, reduced egress widths, insufficient locker, shower, and toilet space for both men and women, and lack of handicap access. The building requires correction of fire and building code violations. Various paint finishes are deteriorated, including the hangar floor coating. Concrete in hangar bays are spalled and cracked. Room 223B is being used as a SIPRNET security room but does not have the required physical security features. <br><br>The existing steam heating system has failed. The piping, on both steam supply and condensate-return systems is leaking due to excessive corrosion and fatigue. The fuel vapor exhausting is inadequate in the maintenance bays, especially the Fuel Cell, leading to vapors being detected in the admin areas. Sanitary drains must be installed with appropriate chemical contamination protection. Critical electrical loads are not connected to the automatic transfer switch and the generator due to changes in building configuration. Circuits are not clearly indicated on panel boards. When circuits are tripped, building occupants are unable to determine locations of circuit breakers. The electrical system appears unbalanced. Lighting in maintenance bays is sufficient.<br><br>The estimated construction cost of this project is between $2,500,000 and $5,000,000. <br>_______________________________________________________________________________<br><br>The Contractor will be required to commence work within 10 days after notice to proceed and complete the work 420 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed.

All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide timely and effective services within three (3) days of this publication.

Unless a significant price disparity exists which deems a large business suitable for award, award will be made to a small business. Multiple awards will not be considered. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, offerors' initial proposal should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint. At a minimum, the offeror must submit an offer schedule which asserts they will provide the supplies/services to the minimum standards indicated in the solicitation/PWS. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government.  "Best value" means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. In accordance with FAR 12.602 & FAR 13.106-2, technical, price & past performance will be considered in the streamlined evaluation. In the best value decision, the Government may consider any readily available value indicators (examples include past performance, special features of the supply or service required for effective program performance, trade-in considerations, probable life of the item, warranty considerations, maintenance availability, environmental and energy efficiency considerations, and delivery terms). This may result in award being made to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror. The Government's selection of a higher-priced, higher rated offer will be supported by a determination that the technical/past performance superiority of the higher-priced offer warrants the additional cost involved. <br><br>52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, 52.212-4 is amended as follows: Paragraph (g) (1): Change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices. Add after paragraph (g) (2) the following: Invoices are to be submitted electronically via Wide Area Work Flow. 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders.

The school shall be designed and constructed to a LEED  'Silver' certifiable rating with the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI) utilizing US Green Building Council's (USGBC) LEED  rating system 2009 for Schools New Construction and Major Renovations. This includes design, construction, and material selections that provide an energy efficient and environmentally sustainable school. The project will include three alternatives (Alternate A:  Phenolic Resin Casework, Alternate B:  Solid Plastic Casework and Alternate C: Epoxy Resin Casework).

The availability of programmed funds will determine which alternative will be chosen. An option will be included to secure movable kitchen equipment. <br>Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00.
