The operation will include interpretive boat tours, snorkel and dive trips, a water taxi service, canoe and kayak rentals, a gift shop, and sales of packaged snacks and refreshments.  Gross revenues over the past three years have averaged approximately $351,000 annually.  The term of this contract is expected to be seven years, and will require a minimum franchise fee to be paid to the National Park Service of 2% of gross revenue per year.  The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR 51, has determined that this is a qualified contract, within the meaning regarding determination of a preferred offeror, because gross receipts are expected to be less than $500,000 in the first year of the contract.  The current concessioner has been determined to have been a 'satisfactory' operator.  Therefore, the current concessioner is considered to be a "preferred offeror", which basically means that they have the right to match the terms of any better offer, as long as they have submitted a "responsive offer".  Offers must be received by 4:00pm January 15, 2003.  The Prospectus will explain the business opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the proposal instructions, and the proposal package (including the selection factors).  There will be an administrative charge to recoup printing cost of $30.00 plus a $5.00 mailing fee for each prospectus.  Please make checks for $35.00 payable to the National Park Service.  Include a physical address (not post office box) and telephone number.  All requests for prospectuses should be made in writing to Henry Benedetti, Chief, Commercial Services, National Park Service, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street SW, Atlanta, GA, 30303.  No telephone requests for the prospectus will be honored.  Please note that no further information than that provided above is available through any other internet resources or links.  Concession contracts are not contracts within the meaning of 41 USC 601 et seq. (the Contract Disputed Act) and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal service contracts or other types of federal procurement actions.

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSC&#64979;POL.

(The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC&#64979;POL #215&#64979;'737&#64979;7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d) 	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal.

	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                                                ].

The base period of performance will be 12 months with four one-year options. DiscoverWare will modify existing modules of the computer based training (CBT) program which they initially developed.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1.	Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.  

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records or recipients.  

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

	Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary.

(a)	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and   

(b)	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certifications.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and 

(c)	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, 

(d)	A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) though (c), above.

2.	Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term o f the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/'or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3.	Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

4.	Written agreement of disposal.   For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning, or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center intends to enter into a sole source procurement with Seemann Composites of Gulfport Mississippi.  Seemann Composites shall become an integral member of the Composite Sail design/build team process and will provide design support, fabricate large critical structural elements, a large scale model demonstration article, prototype sections and scale models in support of the Composite Advanced Sail Project for the Virginia Class submarine over a five year period.  The selection of Seemann Composites was based on an extensive multi down select between several composite vendors.   The composite advanced sail is a very large, doubly-curved, thick-section part manufactured from high quality marine composites.  The demands of this fabrication challenge required that the vendor meet various stringent requirements demonstrating proficiency  in the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process of greater than two inch thick composite parts, demonstrated fabrication proficiency for the maximum size part anticipated (90 ft x 17 ft x 20 ft) and for parts of similar complexity by having fabricated components of similar complexity using the VARTM process.  The selected vendor was required to have a facility adequate for fabrication and storage of large structures and personnel with the necessary expertise in large-scale composite design, fabrication and inspection.  The selected vendor was required to demonstrate that they have implemented Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) and have experience in machining large composite parts (cutting, drilling and finish trim).   The vendor was also required to have control procedures in place in order to maintain quality throughout the manufacturing processes inc luding NDE and three-dimensional measurement capability.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) requests information from industry regarding SPAWAR's potential requirement for Fiber Optic Modem= s for the audio-visual (A-V) briefing and display infrastructure at the Nimitz-MacArthur Pacific Command Center. This potential requirement is = in reference to the Headquarters for the 21st Century (HQ21) project. This= announcement invites interested contractors to submit White Papers that= describe industry capabilities to meet this requirement and that provid= e rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) projections of the price of the potentia= l acquisition. The Nimitz-MacArthur Pacific Command Center is the new facility being b= uilt for the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Command (HQ USCINCPAC) at Camp H.M. Smith, Hawaii.  The HQ21 project involves the installation=  of all C4I systems into the new building - from SATCOM to secure video teleconferencing systems. The backbone of the audio-visual briefing and display infrastructure wi= ll be capable of transporting high quality, high resolution RGB video and aud= io between several spaces throughout the Command Center via fiber optics. =  The typical video signals will be computer generated RGBHV (red-green-blue video, with external horizontal and vertical sync) graphics at SXGA resolution= (1280x1024 pixels) at 60Hz and will be displayed on SXGA large screen displays at the receiving end points.  A-V sources will be shared between 14 spa= ces throughout the Command Center.  In the planned system, all source signa= ls will be transmitted from the 14 spaces via fiber optic modems to a common central site.  In the central site, the A-V signals from the fiber optic receiv= er modems will be routed with high-resolution RGBHV video and audio switch= ing equipment and retransmitted to the various spaces via fiber optics.  Th= e possible graphics detail of the video sources requires high quality distortion-free outputs at the far end receivers.  Currently known vide= o modems are multi-fiber analog (AM and FM) based and have been seen to produce = loss in video quality such as color convergence problems, color shifting, smear= ing, and edge blurring possibly due to the limitations of the technology.  The SPAWAR HQ21 Project is seeking a solution for a modem pair capable of transpor= ting detailed SXGA at 60Hz RGBHV graphics over fiber optics with minimal distortion as compared to the original signal.  It is approximated that initially = 80 pairs of these modems maybe used in the Command Center with the possibility o= f more in future expansion projects.  Potential solutions must meet the minimu= m requirements listed below: General =B7 A digital fiber transmission solution is desirable.  Analog solutio= n may be acceptable if devices meet all other requirements. RGB Video =B7 One-way video transmission. =B7 Auto-sense standard PC graphics resolutions up to and including a m= inimum of SXGA at 60Hz.  Graphics capability up to SXGA at 75Hz is optimum. =B7 External separate horizontal and vertical sync preferred but others= acceptable (i.e. RGsB, RGBS, RsGsBs). =B7 Capable of interfacing standard PC graphics adapters and standard S= XGA capable displays with 75Ohm termination. =B7 PC and monitor connection via 15pinHD or multiple BNC connectors.  = BNC connection preferred. Audio (optional, can be accomplished with separate devices) =B7 One-way, 1 or 2-channel line level in and out. =B7 20KHz frequency response per channel. Fiber Optics =B7 Multimode fiber using standard connectors (ST or SC) and wavelength= s. =B7 Single fiber desired.  Multiple fibers acceptable. =B7 Fiber lengths used in applications may be 6ft to 1000ft.  Multiple patches along fiber path possible.  Must tolerate optical fiber path loss up to= 10dB. Physical =B7 Standard 19inch rack mountable.  1RU height or multiple card cage t= ype configurations. =B7 Capable of 24/7 operations at 0 to 50 degrees Celsius. =B7 Must tolerate frequent power switching.  Modems may be powered off,=  via external controllable AC power devices, to shut off optics for far end access control of video signals.  Control signaling, such as RS232 or contact closure (preferred), will be used if available. =B7 Front panel power and optical link indication. Content of White Papers: White Papers shall be limited to ten (10) page= s and shall provide: 1. Information regarding the firm's ability to meet the requirement abo= ve. This information shall include the physical and functional descriptions of t= he modem, performance specifications (including quantity and type of fiber= s required), and production time. a. The Government is particularly interested in identifying if digital-based modems that meet its requirement are available in the market. If digital-based modems that meet its requirement are not available, the Government requ= ests that industry provide information on the estimated length of time and R= OM cost to develop such an item and the estimated ROM price of the item while i= n production.. 2. Information on whether the firm holds an exiting GSA Federal Supply Contract or other contractual vehicle that SPAWAR may utilize to procure this potential requirement. 3. ROM projections of price for the potential requirement. 4. Administrative Information:  (a) name and address of firm; (b) avera= ge annual revenue for past three years and number of employees; (c) busine= ss type/ownership, indicating whether: Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Women-Owned, HUBZone, and/or Veteran-Owned Business; (d) number of year= s in business; (e) two company points of contact, including: name, title, ph= one, fax, and e-mail address; (f) DUNS Number (if available); (g) a list of customers for similar items sold during the past five years, including = a summary of the item sold, contract number, contract type, dollar value = for each contract referenced, and a customer point of contact with phone number.= At a later date, the Government may request submission of product sampl= es from industry to confirm qualitative characteristics. This Request for Information is for information and planning purposes o= nly and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a= solicitation announcement for proposals or quotes and no contract/order= will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any c= osts associated with providing information in response to this announcement,=  or in response to any follow-up information requests. Respondents will not be= notified of the results of the Government's evaluation of White Papers.=  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside, a= HUBZone set-aside or an 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Clinical Sciences (DCS), Laboratory of Pathology (LP) plans to procure an AutoPix 110V for the FDA-NCI Joint Clinical Proteomics Initiative from Arcturus Engineering, Inc., 400 Logue Avenue, Mountain View, CA 94043.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500.   The primary focus of the "Clinical Proteomics Initiative" (CPI) that exists between the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is the advancement of common research interests shared by CBER and NCI in the application and development of proteomic technology to the diagnosis and treatment of human cancer, development of proteomic tools that can detect and predict therapeutic efficacy and toxicity, further evaluate licensed and experimental drugs and biologics, and build upon the work emanating from the CPI.  Laser Capture Microdissection was invented in the laboratory as a method for isolating specific cells within a complex tissue section for DNA, RNA and proteomic analysis. This approach has enabled NCI to isolate normal, pre-malignant and malignant cell populations for the proteomic analysis of pro-survival and pro-death pathways.  This technology has been applied to the effectiveness of clinical trials, gene expression, and vaccine validation.  The existing equipment (PixCell II and PixCell IIe models) utilizes a manual method of microdisscetion, utilizing an inverted light microscope with a near infra-red laser.  This low temperature laser limits damage to nucleic acids and proteins. This initiative is to further develop and enhance the methodology used for screening molecular markers and pathway targets in human tissue during disease progression.  Minimum Requirements: 1) solid state near infra-red laser and thermoplastic film for embedding the cells.  The laser is pulsed and shall last approximately 50 years; 2) no special tissue mounting or slide preparation required.  LCM is performed on fixed tissue sections, frozen tissue sections or fixed cytological smears and cell cultures; 3) shall incorporate a completely enclosed design with integrated fluorescence microdissection capabilities and; 4) shall allow standardization and consistency in microdissection of clinical trial tissue, aiding in the evaluation of potential cancer treatments.  Arcturus Engineering, Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can meet the aforementioned requirements.  Also, the AutoPix 110V is the only system known that is available to accommodate and process up to 3 slides automatically in a single session as well as the only system available with automatic cell recognition software.  In addition, Arcturus Engineering is the only source known with a patented near infra-red laser and thermoplastic film for embedding cells.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.   However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington D.C. time) on November 15, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Faxed copies of capability statements will not be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to issue an RFP for multiple Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contracts for the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (Female Contraceptive Clinical Trial Topic Area).  The NIH, NICHD is the lead Federal agency for the conduct of basic, clinical and epidemiological research to develop new contraceptives and to evaluate existing methods of contraception and reproductive health.  The Center for Population Research (CPR), within NICHD, was established in 1968 by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, with the important goal of developing new contraceptives through the use of contracts and grants. Within CPR, the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has long supported several preclinical contraceptive testing facilities, as well as facilities for chemical and peptide synthesis.  To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996 CRHB established the initial NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) in order to conduct Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new female contraceptive methods.  

The NICHD CCTN is an important component of the CRHB contraceptive development capability.  Products that have undergone synthesis and successful pre-clinical testing, either through the CRHB formulation and testing facilities or through outside sources, are candidates for clinical testing in the CCTN. The CCTN is particularly valuable for providing a venue for testing new contraceptive drugs and devices that have been developed by small companies that lack the resources to support large-scale Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new female contraceptive methods.  

The new CCTN, that will operate under Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contracts, will be able to rapidly develop protocols and initiate clinical trials shortly after candidate products have completed the necessary preclinical testing.  The resultant IDIQ contracts will consist of a one-year base period and six one-year option periods. Both female and male contraceptives will undergo Phase I, II, and III clinical trials in the new CCTN.  It is estimated that the new CCTN will consist of approximately 12 sites capable of performing female contraceptive clinical trials and approximately four sites capable of performing male contraceptive clinical trials.  Please be advised that the NICHD is issuing separate RFPs for each Topic Area (Female Contraceptive Clinical Trials & Male Contraceptive Clinical Trials) in order to better facilitate and coordinate the evaluation of Proposals.  This announcement is for the RFP for the Female Contraceptive Trials Topic Area, only.  

Offerors may choose to propose on either RFP (Female Contraceptive Trials & Male Contraceptive Trials) or both RFPs depending on their organization?s capabilities.  However, please be advised that the NICHD will not accept combined proposals (Female & Male) from offerors who wish to propose on both RFPs.  Those offerors that propose on both RFPs must provide separate individual Technical and Business Proposals in response to each RFP.

Organizations that believe they have the capabilities and recruitment ability necessary to participate in this network, may access the Request for Proposal(s), RFP-NICHD-2003-04, electronically on the FedBizOpps website, at http://www.eps.gov/spg/HHS/NIH/NICHD/postdate_1.html, on or about November 1, 2002. Please note that the NICHD does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP. The NICHD also reserves the right to cancel the requirement at any time prior to contract award.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST  FOR QUOTE Description: The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Exposure Research Laboratory/Human Exposure & Atmospheric Sciences Division (HEASD), Exposure & Dose Research Branch (EDRB), Las Vegas,  Nevada, is seeking qualified sources to develop molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPS) to detect pyrethroids.  Molecular imprinting is a technique to develop compounds that can mimic the function of antibodies.  The principle of MIPs is that the initial monomers interacts with the analyte for  instance through hydrogen bonding.  These monomers are then polymerized in the presence of the non-covalently interacting analytes.  After the polymerization, the analyte molecules are washed away leaving 3D cavities which resemble the shapes of the analyte molecules.  The final polymeric product  then recognizes the analytes based on the interactive forces and the created shape effects.  The EDRB requires the investigation of interactive forces on the analytes in regard to imprinted polymers using electrochemical transduction methods instead of the optical methods with labeled samples.   This is a sources sought announcement to determine whether or not there are sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Interested organizations should provide information addressing the specific technical issues and the capabilities required to undertake this  project, including:  ~Time estimates for developing and furnishing imprints ~A description of their technology and research plan to prepare various MIPs based on the desired properties Interested organizations should submit two (2) copies of their response, not to exceed 5 pages, addressing the  information requested above and summarizing their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  Responses are due by November 15, 2002.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted  or the Government's use of such information.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's evaluation of the information received.  No basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for  information or the Government's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.  Responses will be held in a confidential manner.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  The North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) code 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees, applies.  All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization in their response.  Responses may be faxed in to (919) 541-4364. Mailed responses should be directed to: McDonald  Morrison, Contracting Officer RTP Procurement Operations Division, MD E105-02, 4930 Old Page Rd, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 Phone:  919-541-4364

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Algeria:  Port of Algiers Second Container Terminal Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to upgrade the productivity of the existing container facility at the Port of Algiers and possibly develop a second container terminal that satisfies its needs.

Of the eleven major multipurpose ports in Algeria, the Entreprise Portuaire d'Alger (EPAL) has the largest container traffic.  At present, seventy percent of Algerian container traffic passes through the Port, and this activity has increased rapidly over the past seven years.  EPAL plans to address the increased demand by adding additional rows for storage containers and improving cranes for lifting and stacking containers.  To accommodate growth, the construction of a second container terminal has been proposed.  In addition to examining the potential market for the proposed second container terminal, the feasibility study will evaluate options for increasing productivity at the existing container terminal through logistics management and information technology improvements.

The study represents Phase I of an assessment of the viability of this project.  Upon the completion of the Phase I study, the U.S. firm selected by EPAL to perform the Phase I study shall submit a final report to EPAL and TDA.  TDA would then consider, subject to the availability of funds, providing additional funds to cover Phase II study costs.  TDA authorization to proceed with TDA grant funding for Phase II would be set forth in a letter to EPAL and the selected Contractor.  TDA is under no obligation to cover expenses incurred by the Contractor or any other entity for such a Phase II study if TDA does not provide such specific written authorization to proceed.  The Contractor must be capable of completing both Phase I and Phase II.  

The objective of this Feasibility Study is to assess upgrading the productivity of the existing container facility at the Port of Algiers in Algeria and possibly develop a second container terminal that satisfies its needs.  The tasks for Phase I are as follows:  1.1) review of existing cargo demand and development of projections, 1.2) development of alternatives, and 1.3) Phase I final report.  The proposed Phase II tasks are as follows:  2.1) selection of alternative, 2.2) detailed improvement planning for the existing container terminal, 2.3) conceptual design for a second container terminal, 2.4) cost estimating, investment plan and financial analysis, 2.5) environmental assessment, 2.6) financing options and privatization analysis, and 2.7) Phase II final report.    

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $217,050 grant to the Grantee (EPAL) from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and in French directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. local Algerian time on Monday, December 16, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>R702 - DATA COLLECTION SERVICES - U.S. Dept. of Commerce/NOAA, intends to procure services of an Collections Analyst with a background in finance and/or collection matters. In its 19977 audit of NOAA's FY 1996 financial statement, KPMG made certain findings and recommendations requiring changes in the procedures NOAA General Counsel (GC) use in its collection work.  In response to the findings and recommendations, GC and NOAA Finance (Finance) worked together to develop procedures that would result in Finance assuming all financial responsibility for accounting, billing and collecting civil monetary penalties for cases where a legally enforceable debt exist.  Procedures were designed to ensure that legally enforceable debts are timely processed in GC and then referred to Finance.  Cases in GC fall into several categories i.e., pre-debt not referred to Finance for billing and collecting, time payments, delinquent debts, Treasury cases, and write-offs.  Case file packages must be reviewed and a determination must be made as to which procedures to follow to resolve debt processing in a timely and accurate manner.  Satisfying these procedures is necessary for NOAA to achieve an unqualified audit from KPMG.  Current staff is insufficient to process all collection work timely.  Cases Services to be performed in Silver Spring, Maryland.  The incumbent will assist General Counsel (GC) staff (located in Gloucester, MA, St. Petersburg, FL., Long Beach, CA., Seattle, WA., Juneau, AK., and Silver Spring, MD) to meet obligations as stated in Compendium of Debt Processing Guidelines and Procedures for Collection or Civil Monetary Penalties. This will be accomplished as follows:
(1)  Review and assess cases for valid debt, availability of debtor information, collection effort to date, final disposition of seized proceeds, and likelihood of collection success;  (2) Follow proper procedures and guidelines prior to referral of cases for Finance;  (3) Incorporate necessary procedures for GC action, including corresponding Enforcement Management Information System (EMIS) entries; (4) Utilize standard forms and EMIS reports to ensure consistent submission of case to Finance; (5) Identify other ways to evaluate what/how frequently dollar amounts of cases being sent to or returned from Finance, and (6) Forms and reports are intended to help modify assessment, settlement, and collection practices to increase percentage of full payment. A minimum amount of travel will be required on an as needed basis. All applicable travel expenses will be paid by GCEL.  Qualifications ranking criteria are as follows: A degree in finance, management, or administration; knowledge of legal terms and references; and  knowledge of financial terms and applications;  knowledge of financial terms and applications; knowledge of collections procedures and terminologies; must be familiar with computer software applications; good oral and organizational skills, and be adept at communicating the Agency's viewpoints; All qualified candidates must submit documentation that they must have the skills documented, the government reserves the right to conduct oral presentations of all qualified offerors as well as a writing sample.

<DESC>Notification of Contract Action (NOCA). This FedBizOpps announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) to extend the period of performance for Reconnaissance, Intelligence, Ground Systems (RIGS) Products and Services, (RPS) contracts to Lockheed and Raytheon under Contract Nos. F19628-97-D-0008 and F19628-97-D-0009 increasing the ordering period and period of performance by one year.  The ordering period for these contracts will be extended from 4 December '02 to 3 December '03.  The related period of performance will be extended to a maximum period ending 3 December 03 to a period ending 3 December '04. There will be no change in the competitively awarded ceiling price.  This extension is a contract action needed to provide a transition period for acquisition of DCGS efforts under the RPS contracts to other contractual vehicles.  The Navy Tactical Input Segment (TIS) will continue to be supported under RPS.  Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) ground stations will be acquired under RPS. Other individual larger RPS/DCGS efforts are intended to be issued as full and open competitive actions similar to the DCGS Block 10.2 upgrade effort currently in its pre-award phase of acquisition.  The Government intends to contract with Raytheon and Lockheed as the only holders of RPS contracts under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(B), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  In this case the USAF may deem products and/or services to be available only from the original sources in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized products or services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (see 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B)).  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Call Marie Sevigny at (781) 377-5562 or email at marie.sevigny@hanscom.af.mil with questions regarding this notice.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Matthew Asai, (202)
<DESC>Amendment 1 <P> October 31, 2002 <P> Added to the announcement is the statement of work/performance specification for the shipboard air-traffic control communications system and eight fit/form drawings.   <P>  The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking interested alternate sources for approximately eight additional AN/SSC-12 SATCC/SIVCS air-traffic control communication systems, spares, logistics documentation, etc. for CVN and Amphibious-type ships which have air-traffic control personnel on board.  Currently installed systems were procured from Northrop-Grumman, Denro Systems, Inc. under contract N65236-97-D-5020.  Alternate sources are sought for: additional systems which are form, fit, and function compatible with the currently deployed AN/SSC-12 systems; spare and repair parts for the current and additional systems; logistics support information; onboard or in-office tech support and repair assistance; etc.  It is anticipated that additional systems may be ordered in at least two variations, tailored in size and capability to the differing ship operational requirements. <P> Any changes from the current systems which affects form, fit, function, spare/repair parts, and existing logistics support documentation will affect existing logistics support documentation.  These changes may cause the government to incur significant non-hardware costs, which must be considered when additional systems are procured. <P> No technical documentation package or drawings are available.  Delivery of the first system is March 2003.  An additional eight systems may be procured by the Navy in the future. <P> All questions/responses shall be sent to the contracting officer via email at matt.asai@faa.gov.  Interested parties should submit information documenting existing systems by 3:00 EST, 18 Nov 02. The contracting officer will not respond to telephonic requests. <P>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to issue an RFP for multiple Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contracts for the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (Female Contraceptive Clinical Trial Topic Area).  The NIH, NICHD is the lead Federal agency for the conduct of basic, clinical and epidemiological research to develop new contraceptives and to evaluate existing methods of contraception and reproductive health.  The Center for Population Research (CPR), within NICHD, was established in 1968 by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, with the important goal of developing new contraceptives through the use of contracts and grants. Within CPR, the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has long supported several preclinical contraceptive testing facilities, as well as facilities for chemical and peptide synthesis.  To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996 CRHB established the initial NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) in order to conduct Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new female contraceptive methods.  

The NICHD CCTN is an important component of the CRHB contraceptive development capability.  Products that have undergone synthesis and successful pre-clinical testing, either through the CRHB formulation and testing facilities or through outside sources, are candidates for clinical testing in the CCTN. The CCTN is particularly valuable for providing a venue for testing new contraceptive drugs and devices that have been developed by small companies that lack the resources to support large-scale Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new female contraceptive methods.  

The new CCTN, that will operate under Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contracts, will be able to rapidly develop protocols and initiate clinical trials shortly after candidate products have completed the necessary preclinical testing.  The resultant IDIQ contracts will consist of a one-year base period and six one-year option periods. Both female and male contraceptives will undergo Phase I, II, and III clinical trials in the new CCTN.  It is estimated that the new CCTN will consist of approximately 12 sites capable of performing female contraceptive clinical trials and approximately four sites capable of performing male contraceptive clinical trials.  Please be advised that the NICHD is issuing separate RFPs for each Topic Area (Female Contraceptive Clinical Trials & Male Contraceptive Clinical Trials) in order to better facilitate and coordinate the evaluation of Proposals.  This announcement is for the RFP for the Female Contraceptive Trials Topic Area, only.  

Offerors may choose to propose on either RFP (Female Contraceptive Trials & Male Contraceptive Trials) or both RFPs depending on their organization?s capabilities.  However, please be advised that the NICHD will not accept combined proposals (Female & Male) from offerors who wish to propose on both RFPs.  Those offerors that propose on both RFPs must provide separate individual Technical and Business Proposals in response to each RFP.

Organizations that believe they have the capabilities and recruitment ability necessary to participate in this network, may access the Request for Proposal(s), RFP-NICHD-2003-04, electronically on the FedBizOpps website, at http://www.eps.gov/spg/HHS/NIH/NICHD/postdate_1.html, on or about November 1, 2002. Please note that the NICHD does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP. The NICHD also reserves the right to cancel the requirement at any time prior to contract award.

DOC also expects the telecommunications carrier to support hardware installation, software installation, and support for management features of all equipment and devices proposed.

The IJPS network will be used to transport the weather satellite data indicated in Table 1.  Table 1 provides a listing that characterizes the different data streams of weather data that will be exchanged between Suitland and Darmstadt. All communications exchanges listed shall involve duplex communications.

The Interface Type field in Table 1 defines the interface between the telecommunication carrier's own-provided customer premise equipment and the respective Network Operation Center (NOC) in the respective organizations (DOC and EUMETSAT). This interface shall be considered a local interface at the respective facilities for the sake of the document. 

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: 

"	Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, and acquiring the IJPS network. 
"	Technical feasibility of the alternative approaches proposed. 
"	Approximate cost information for alternatives (Rough Order of Magnitude Estimates). 
"	Provisioning Schedules. 


III. REQUIREMENTS:   This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for IJPS network. 

"	IJPS Network shall provide commercial-grade data communications capabilities within the network using industry standard network components and protocols.  The potential of adding bandwidth-on-demand services for some data streams is highly desirable and respondents are encouraged to share any existing and future capabilities they have. 

"	IJPS Network shall evolve to maintain a technology and communications service edge with state of the art commercial services to the maximum extent practical. The operator's network shall offer DOC the flexibility to utilize new services. 

"	IJPS Network shall be a turnkey fully integrated system communications network solution proposed by the respondents. DOC will provide access to its own DOC facilities (in Suitland) and EUMETSAT facilities (in Darmstadt). DOC does not intend to negotiate with local access carriers or communications equipment vendors. For the purposes of this RFI, assume a single invoice with supporting details will be acceptable to DOC. 

"	IJPS Network shall support mission critical functions and provide the highest levels of reliability and availability including network transport and access diversity, and rapid response time for DOC outages.  In formulating responses, each respondent shall describe the reliability and availability characteristics of each alternative included in their response.  It is essential that the respondent include a clear definition of availability including a description of the tools that will be used to measure it.  IJPS network shall be operated on a 24X7 basis for 365 days a year by the respondent. 

"	The local interfaces to the IJPS network are based on a TCP/IP protocol suite and a 100 BT interface as indicated in table 1. The applications used for data streams exchanges between the local interface and the IJPS network will use a TCP/IP socket connection. The IJPS network shall not introduce delays to degrade the performance of the local interface for TCP/IP operations as the data is transported between Darmstadt and Suitland.

The IJPS network shall have the buffer capability to handle TCP re-transmissions in case of a communications outage. 

"	While the data streams are presented as separate data flows entries in Table 1, DOC does not have a preference if all streams are treated as separate communications channels on the IJPS Network between Suitland and Darmstadt, or considered as an aggregate bandwidth with each of different streams channelized into a virtual channel. In the latter case,  the DOC contractor's network shall provide a prioritization capability for a DOC specified virtual channel. The IJPS network shall provide the ability to collect and measures for performance data on per virtual channel basis as well as an aggregate one channel basis. 

"	 The IJPS Network shall be built on a completely dedicated network and shall not use the public Internet. Private IP networking services are not discouraged provided that the respondent presents guarantees and service manageability options that can be collected in compliance of meeting the defined performed criteria or Service Level Agreement (SLA). 

DOC encourages respondent to present alternative concepts and to describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements. The response shall include a diagram with proposed network configuration and CPE at each location (Suitland and Darmsatdt).

The DOC contractor shall provide all performance specifications to the delivery of the communication services including network and system availability, time to restore services, and performance evaluation criteria. DOC  expects the contractor to also discuss their performance evaluation criteria. 

"	Encryption shall not be required for transport of DOC data; however, DOC requires a level of trust on the carrier network that is not going to compromise any data transfer over the IJPS Network. 

"	The respondent shall provide ROM estimates for the non-recurring and annual recurring using for the IJPS network. Assume a 3 year guaranteed contract. 

"	The respondent shall provide estimated provisioning schedules with the time it takes for a service to be provisioned. The provisioning time shall include local -access provisioning during which the local loop is connected to the customer site, and service provisioning, during which the service is configured and turned on the respondent's carrier network. In the response, a respondent shall include any additional costs for expedited provisioning. 

"	A contact phone number and e-mail address shall be included with the response as a point of contact for the DOC evaluation team to discuss

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, is interested in identifying an industrial partner for the ELF On Hull Antenna Future Naval Capability demonstration. The feasibility of the On Hull ELF receiving antenna was demonstrated during two previous ONR 6.2 Exploratory Development Programs. During FY03, the transition of the technology from those programs to an ONR 6.3 Advanced Development Program will commence. This effort will involve the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport teaming with an industrial partner to design for manufacturability and build two magnetic core loop Advanced Development Antennas incorporating noise mitigation technologies with platform integration. Successful demonstration of the Advanced Development Antennas may lead to a contract solicitation for production of antennas for each submarine in the fleet plus spares. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, is interested in conducting a pre-solicitation industry brief to present interested vendors with a more detailed overview of On Hull Antenna technologies and requirements. Vendors with the capability to design and manufacture magnetic core loop antennas who are interested in attending this industry brief (yet to be scheduled) should respond to Ray Smith, as follows: Send your Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Email Address, Telephone Number, CAGE Code, and reference N66604-03-R-0541 to SmithRD@Npt.NUWC.Navy.Mil.

<SUBJECT>M -- Operations and Maintenance Support Services
<DESC>The USDA, ARS, Contracts Branch intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with LB&B Associates, a 66 day extension of the performance period of Contract 53-3K06-6-1000 from November 1- January 5, 2003.  The contractor shall furnish on-site operations and maintenance support services for the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) located in Plum Island, New York.  Services include but are not limited to:  heating, air conditioning, waste water treatment, incinerator service, power plant services, vessel, electrical, vehicle, and equipment services to support the scientific research mission of the PIADC.  During the extension period, phase-in will begin for the resultant contract.  Based on LB&B's comprehensive knowledge of the PIADC research mission, the complex systems which support the bio-contained laboratory, its evolving integrated support service requirements, familiarity with the Union, and its broad technical expertise, LB&B is in a unique position to provide the PIADC operations and maintenance services for an extended period (November 1- January 5, 2003).  LB&B is the only known source that possesses both the intimate knowledge of the facility and the Union required to ensure continuity of services at PIADC for this period.  Due to biosecurity and biosafety concerns and current economic strike by the Union employees, entering into a new contract for the period of this extension would be detrimental to the research mission.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  The contracting action will be other than full and open competition under the Authority 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), Justification: Supplies or Services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and not other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.

<DESC>This is a combined sources sought ntoice/pre-solicitation notice. The USDA/ARS intends from Informax, Inc., 7600 Wisconsin Aveneu, Bethesda, MD 20814, the item Vector NTI Suite 2 and LabShare software on a sole-source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), if no other responsive, responsible sources are found. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The Government intends to use Commercial Item procedures, FAR Part 12.  Such capabilities/ qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  The Pathogen Database project is currently in the formulation phase and is planning to acquire mature, validated software to analyze the relatedness and origins of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as features common to unrelated microorganisms. The software must be licensed to support 20 concurrent users in at least 3 distinct locations.  It is critical that the software incorporate both character and graphical representations of nucleotide sequence, genes, specific features of genes or genomic regions within a single instance of the program.  Selection of regions of nucleotide sequence in either the character or graphic panes must be reflected simultaneously in the other pane.  Sequence regions and graphical symbols for various types of sequence features (exons, open reading frames, promoters, etc.) must be user-definable and incorporate notes, comments and references.  Software must be capable of accurately importing and exporting nucleotide sequence (including all relevant features such as notes, coding sequences, primers, etc.)  in standard file formats (FASTA, GenBank, EMBL, raw text ).  Compatibility with current NCBI formats must be maintained.  For sequence files selected, software must be capable of calling external web-based analytical programs, porting the sequence files to these programs and visualizing the output of the analysis.  Flexibility for ready incorporation of additional external programs is required.  The software must be capable of directly interfacing with a relational database running under Oracle 9i relational database management software to both retrieve and generate records.  Object-based restriction of access to records, by individual, group or location, is essential.  Database must be compatible with BLAST searching. The client software must operate on PC-compatible computers running Windows 98 or higher.  The relational database must run on Unix-compatible servers, be TCP/IP compatible and be accessible from remote locations through a firewall. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. mountain standard time on November 15, 2002.
