<SUBJECT>59--Theater Deployable Communications Modules and kits
<SOLNBR>R707
<CONTACT>Joan Wandrei joan.wandrei@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>Theater Deployable Communications (TDC) is a state-of-the-art ground communications system designed to replace legacy communications systems in use at deployable Air Force units.  TDC provides a local and metropolitan area switched communications network for Internet protocol, voice, and video data through the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) circuit switches, hubs, routers, multiplexers, and other equipment.  The current TDC module and kit equipment baseline is comprised of a suite of 22 different modules and 40 associated kits that together provide the required deployed base communications services.  While all communications and computer components are COTS, they must be packaged for operation and transport in transit and transport cases.<br><br> The original TDC module and kit contract was awarded in Oct 1996, with follow on contracts awarded in Jun 2002.  Due to higher than anticipated orders resulting from Operatoions Enduring and Iraqi Freedom, we reached contract ceilings sooner than expected and must recompete the contract in FY04.
