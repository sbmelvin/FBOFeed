<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for light weight power conversion equipment for military and commercial aircraft which consists of the following:Transformer rectifier( tru) to convert 3 phase 115 vac 400 Hz.aircraft power to 28 vdc power and a frequency converter to convert 3 phase 115 vac 400hz aircraft power to 115 vac 60hz power. This power conversion equipment is required to provide the necessary power to operate the research equipment onboard the NASA research aircraft. In the early 1980's, NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) standardized the research power design and equipment on board the research aircraft so that the equipment could be transported from one aircraft to another ( line replaceable units – lru). This provided NASA (GRC) a cost savings since a redesign of the power system was not required when there were changes or failure of a unit. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the transformer rectifier and frequency converter from Avionics Instruments Inc. of Avenel, NJ. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)(6.302), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The items listed in this procurement are direct replacement units for which NASA/GRC has already standardized the research power and design  equipment, fabricated the mounting hardware, installed the electrical wiring and obtained safety approval. Use of any other source would severely jeopardize the standardization/compatibility of the research equipment for the research aircraft and result in a redesign including additional  fabrication costs. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 25, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>We will furnish and install, mechanically and electrically, a series of 13 ett. 24" diameter exhaust fans. 13 as. 5-wing, propeller-type exhaust fans rated at 10,055 cfm per unit. Each fan is directly driven by a 2000 watt, 240 volt, 1 phase electric motor. Motors ale TEPC with automatic thermal protection and class F insulation. Each unit is equipped with a single panel, back draft damper-type shutter and built-in OSHA approved intake guard. We will mount four units in each of the three basement exhaust areas, as discussed, and one unit in the separate utility room, We will make the necessary alterations to the exhaust areas in order to properly accept the new exhaust units. The electrical portion of the job covers one fan to be controlled with a wall switch, The remainder will be. controlled by time . clocks and contactors. The power in the hospital is 480/277v & 120/208v three-phase and the exhaust-fans require 240 volt single-phase power. This will require the use of buck¬boost transformers which is included in this quotation. Also, due to the physical distance of the fans from the power sources, #10 THHN wire will be used for voltage drop considerations. The electrical portion of this quotation is based on the information given to us during the walk through with Steven Davenport on March 16, 2006 and is subject to change if the scope of the work changes.

The purpose of this agreement is to repair select areas of the public trail system on the south side of the Tijuana River, within the Tijuana Slough National Wildlife Refuge.  Portions of the trails have been damaged and eroded from recent storms, seasonal flooding and use by hikers and equestrians, resulting in unsafe trail conditions.  Trail damage has resulted in users creating new trails around damaged areas, with adverse effects on wildlife habitat.  This work will focus on the trail north of the AThree Corners@ area where damage is most severe and will also address other damaged areas. This RFQ package is ONLY available electronically from http://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/login.jsp

SUBJECT:  131 Pod Prototype Modification Allowing Flight Testing Of An Air Force Developmental Techniques Generator And Two Air Force Developmental Fiber Optic Towed Decoys

This is not a Request for Proposal Submission.

This is a notice of a contract action. The Combat Electronic Systems Squadron (CESS) is contemplating the issuance of a Sole Source Contract with the following contractor:

Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC), ES-DSD
600 Hicks Road,
Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008

No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of a response to this notice.  

The Government anticipates awarding Time and Material (T&M) Task Order against AF Contract #F090603-03-D0002.  The period of performance will be 8 months for this effort at a cost of $1,000,000.00. 

Acquisition Environment:  The statutory authority, which permits other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 United States Code (USC) 2304(c) (1), as implemented by 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) (A); Only one source, or limited number of sources, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  J&A# JA-041/22 Nov 02.

The program office plans to issue the RFP 15 days from this publication and award this contract by 31 Jul 06.

Requirements:

The requirement being filled will be to prototype an Electronic Warfare Pod and flight test a developmental Techniques Generator (TG) with 2 developmental FOTDs. Specifically, the proposed 8 month contracted effort will be for engineering services to analyze and retrofit an existing Air Force (AF) ALQ-131 electronic countermeasure pod with an AF provided fiber optic towed decoy (FOTD) launcher and advanced technique generator (TG). The resulting integrated electronic countermeasures pod will be used for flight testing.  NGC is the only known source with the knowledge necessary to provide the retrofit and integration efforts required. 

Technical Objective:  

Contractor shall analyze and retrofit an existing USAF ALQ-131 electronic countermeasure pod, initially produced by Northrop Grumman, to incorporate a fiber optic towed decoy (FOTD) launcher.  In addition, an advanced technique generator (TG), which has been recently developed by Northrop Grumman, will replace the obsolete technique generator functionality presently contained in the ALQ-131.  The resulting prototype pod with contractor support will be flight tested for performance on an F-15 aircraft at Eglin AFB early in calendar year 2007.  


For potential subcontracting opportunities, interested parties may contact Mr. Stephen
Kaiser, NGC, (847)259-9600 ext. 4764.

<DESC>The purpose of this effort is to develop a design tool set which will combine an array of intellectual property  blocks in Ultra CMOS Silicon on Sapphire technology into functional RFSoCs.  The tool set will utilize IP blocks which have been proven to meet all RF requirements inherent in RF systems. The tool set will provide the capability for RFIC designers to quickly develop an RFSoC for radio systems operating at up to 3 GHz.  The tool set will seamlessly integrate all RF and digital subsystem and chip-level design facets in an industry-standard software platform.  It will integrate system design; analog/digital partitioning; RF integrated circuit design; device and package modeling and optimization; test generation; design validation and characterization; computer-aided-design; and a library of characterized RF circuit IP blocks.   The contractor shall identify and receive written government approval from the Administrative Contracting Officer  prior to committing to the use of any privately developed items, components, processes, computer software, and/or technical data which they:  (i) intend to deliver with Limited Rights; (ii) intend to deliver with Government Purpose License Rights; (iii) intend to deliver with restricted rights; and   (iv) have not yet determined if such rights should apply.  The contractor shall perform administrative, technical, and financial management function during the course of this effort and shall maintain a status of their effort towards achieving the objectives, including all technical activities and efforts, problems/deficiencies, impacts, and recommended solutions.  Contractor shall conduct technical interchange meetings as necessary in the performance of this task.  Technical interchange meetings with the contractor shall be scheduled when there is need for technical interchange between the government and the contractor.  The content of the meeting can include the discussion of any information that has impact upon the task activities, including documentation contents or format.   The purpose of this effort is to develop a computer-based design tool set which can be used to combine an array of intellectual property blocks in Ultra CMOS Silicon on Sapphire technology into functional RFSoCs.  The ‘design tool set’ terminology used throughout this statement comprises 3 entities.
(1) EDA Tools – Industrial standard RFIC and mixed-signal design software supplied by Cadence.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), PG-13 Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS), currently intend to enter into a contract with Hoffman Engineering Corporation, Stamford CT. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334515. Anticipated award of contract is July 2006.  The item description includes equipment to support development of Marine Corps Electro Optical Systems Test Facility. The following is required for purchase:  CLIN 0001 Quantity (1) LS-65-8E Luminance/Radiance Standard; CLIN 0002 Quantity (5) LLP-0043 Spare Lamps (The LS-65-8E is provided with a spectral run performed at 500fl.); CLIN 0003 FOB Destination.  The following requirements to the above quantities are as follows: The variety of weapon sights and irradiating devices to be evaluated span a rather wide range of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum (visible band--VIS, near infra-red band—NIR, and the short wave targets that can encompass tha!  t wavelength range.  The test equipment and targets necessary to characterize these sights must themselves be characterized by way of calibration procedures which requires a standard light source that enables traceability to the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).  The source must not induce a variation in to output color temperature as the light level is varied.  This requires that the source incorporate a variable slit or knife edge that is micrometer controlled.  In addition the industry standard for the measurements to be enacted requires that the color temperature provided at the output of the light source be set for a 2856 degrees Kelvin (K) Blackbody Color Temperature, and also that it exhibit a uniform output as provided by a single integrating sphere with an output port of approximately 2 inches.  The light level provided at the output of the integrating sphere must attain at least 500 footlamberts, and be continuously variable down to approxima!  tely 0.001 footlamberts while retaining a constant blackbody color tem perature of 2856K.  Internal light monitoring by a built-in silicon sensor or equivalent is essential in order to ascertain light level settings and stability throughout the range of the light levels that the source provides.  The source must be portable and be able to retain calibration if moved within a laboratory environment.  In order to maximize portability, computer control of the source is not acceptable.

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive !  proposals, as the Government has determined that there is no other vendor that meets the requirements set forth above. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Questions concerning this intent can be e-mailed to: crystal.m.clark@usmc.mil or faxed to number (703) 432-3526. The date and time of closing is MONDAY, JULY 17, 2006, 3:30pm EST (Eastern Standard Time).

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Special Communications Requirements (SCR) Division, Patuxent River, St. Inigoes, MD has requirements for various commercial Auto Aquire Antennas and ancillaries.  The Government intends to establish an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with one 12-month base period and 2 12-month option periods for these antenna on a sole source basis with TracStar Systems, Inc., Orlando, FL, the sole manufacturer and distributor.  Items to be included in the IDIQ are 30 each 1.2M Auto Acquire Ku Band Antenna System with PLL LNB – Vehicle Mount, part number (P/N) MVS1200; 60 each .96M Auto Acquire Antenna System with PLL LNB – Vehicle Mount including Block-upConverter P/N NRJC501F & iDirect Series 7350 Infinity Modem P/N 7350, P/N MVS960; 30 each .96M Case Based Auto Acquire Antenna System with PLL LNB, P/N MVS960P; 60 each In-Motion Auto Acquire Acquisition & Tracking Antenna for reception of DirecTV or Network, P/N SV360D; 25 each 4 Watt Block Up-Converter, P/N NJRC5017F;  30 each iDirect Series 7350 Infinity Modem, P/N 7350; 30 each Edge Access Router with integrated 4 Port VoIP, P/N BB400; 30 each 8 Watt Block Up-Converter Kit, P/N 105700 (Agilis 8W 24 Volt); 30 each PWA TWIC2, P/N 102041; 30 each .96 Electronics Box Assembly, P/N 103016; 30 each 1.2M Electronics Box Assembly, P/N 106016; 30 each Splitter, P/N 100190-1; 30 each IDD Asseembly, P/N 103086; 30 each Cable-IDD, P/N 100291; 30 each Compass, P/N 102145; 30 each Power Supply, P/N 103009; 30 each Gel Filled Boot, P/N 100172; 30 each GPS Assembly Antenna, P/N 102013; and 30 each PLL LNB, P/N Nortsat 1507HA.   Only the above listed antenna and ancillaries were found to meet all of the Governments technical requirements. The antenna system must be fully functional when exposed to the following conditions:  During travel, the system’s azimuth must be 400&#9702; or + 200&#9702; from the stow position; must be 0-65&#9702; (+) during elevation-operation, and + 55&#9702; or + 95&#9702; during polarization; must operate at a receiving frequency of 10.70-12.75 GHz, gain (+.2dBi) midband at 39.7 dBi at 11.95 GHz., the system must possess a beamwidth of orbital ARC degrees -3dB 1.8 at 12 GHz.; possess a transmit frequency of 13.75-14.5 GHz., a gain of 41.2 dBi, and a beamwidth in orbital Arc degree of 1.5 a t 14.3 GHz.  The system must be equipped with iDirect Series 7350 Infinity Modem, NJT 5017F 4W Block, and Phase Lock Loop (PLL) Low Noise Block (LNB).  The operational requirements for both the MVS960 and the MVS1200 are essential, because of the environmental situation in which these systems will be deployed.  The TracStar systems satisfies the project requirements, because it has survival stowed capability, to winds up to 125 mph, capable of operating in winds up to 60 mph and with stand temperatures of -20&#9702; F to 125&#9702; F while deployed.  SCR has fielded 25 such systems, therefore, it is imperative to maintain the interoperability and interchangeability with fielded systems.  If an alternative vendor product were selected, the Government would incur significant, unrecoverable nonrecurring engineering, test and evaluation, and logistical costs associated multiple equipments types and managing multiple inventories.  The period of performance for this effort starts 30 July 2006 at NAWCAD, Webster Field, St. Ingoes, MD 20684 and is based on an anticipated award of 30 July 2006.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for further R&D of TiAl alloy for Hypersonic Structural Applications with the alloy  cast as an ingot and then extruded into bars with a diameter of at least .625". A total of 140" of extruded bar shall be delivered to NASA-GRC. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the extruded bar from UES, Inc., 4401 Dayton-Xenia Rd., Dayton, OH 45432-1894. The justification for lack of competition is that UES has recently demonstrated sheet fabrication ability using their newly developed beta-gamma TiAl alloy. They have extensive proprietary knowledge of TiAl alloy selection and processing techniques. Additionally, since this is an emerging technology, UES has not licensed any of its beta-gamma TiAl alloy compositions or processes to anyone and therefore no other vendor exists. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Government does not guarantee award within this period nor shall the Government be liable for any costs should award occur b efore or after this period or occur at all.  Estimated project cost range is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.   2.  PROJECT INFORMATION.  Turkey Creek is a right bank tributary of the lower Kansas River with its headwaters in Lenexa, Kansas.  It has a drainage area of 23 square miles before passing through an approximately 1,261-foot long tunnel and approximately 17 7-foot long subway to the Kansas River.  Turkey Creek is approximately 15 miles long and runs parallel to I-35 nearly its entire length.   The Turkey Creek Tunnel is concrete lined, 28-foot diameter horseshoe shaped, and approximately 1,261 feet in length.  The downstream end of the tunnel is directly connected to the Subway, which is a box-shaped, concrete structure and approximately 177 fee t in length.  Construction of the tunnel and subway was completed circa 1920.  The tunnel passes through several ledges of limestone and shale belonging to the Kansas City Group.  The Turkey Creek General Reevaluation Report dated January 2003, and the Rep ort of the Chief of Engineers for Flood Damage Reduction in the Turkey Creek Basin, Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas, dated December 19, 2003 (GRR) addresses improvements to the Turkey Creek Tunnel to be performed as part of the Federal Projec t.  Improvements include erosion cavity repair (void filling) in the upper 300 feet of the existing tunnel and  repair/replacement of the deteriorated liner downstream of the upper 300 feet of tunnel.  Tunnel improvements detailed in the GRR were divided i nto Phase 1 and Phase 2 because of the different construction procedures required in the upstream portion of the tunnel versus the downstream portion, and for logistical reasons.  In general, Phase 1 Improvements addressed repair of the sidewall erosion ca vities in the upstream 300 feet of tunnel and invert damage in the upstream 500 feet.  Phase 2 will address the deteriorated liner downstream of the Phase 1 Improvements, and the remaining improvements to the upstream 500 feet of the tunnel at the completi on of Phase 1.  3.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources for walk-through metal detectors (a.k.a. Enhanced Metal Detectors -EMDs) for use at our Nation’s airports. Offerors must submit a product that satisfies the TSA technical requirements. TSA will examine each Offeror’s response to this announcement to evaluate experience, existing product capabilities and production capabilities.  The TSA will establish a Qualified Product List (QPL) based on the technical performance of each Offeror’s EMD against TSA specifications.  Only Offerors who respond to this announcement and who demonstrate they can fulfill TSA’s requirements will be eligible for placement onto the QPL.  Only the offerors who are successfully included on the QPL will be eligible to compete for a possible contract award.  Placement on the QPL does not guarantee receipt of contract.    

INSTRUCTIONS 
There are 6 steps in this source selection process:

Step-1	Industry sources interested in participating in this procurement must respond to this announcement.  Responses must be received by Mr. Adam Freimanis or Ms. Melissa Conley no later than Monday July 17, 2006 5:30 P.M. EDT (see note).  The offeror must provide a white paper not to exceed 4 single-sided pages (12 pt font, 1 inch margins, 8.5 inch x 11 inch paper) describing  walk- through metal detector experience.  Offerors must submit either a hard copy or electronic version.  The electronic version must be submitted in PDF format or read-only Word documents. The white paper must contain the following information:

1.	Models Produced:  All interested parties must submit a list of EMDs currently in production. Production history of each unit must also be provided, including month/year of initial production and quantity produced in each of the last six (6) months.

2.	  Manufacturing Capabilities: All interested parties must provide the location of manufacturing facilities in which current products are produced. Descriptions of these facilities must provide; size, number of employees, production capacity for each metal detector model, current operating level as a percentage of maximum capacity and the types of manufacturing operations performed in each facility.  Each company must also provide historical past performance references (min. of three references with POC information).  The past performance must reflect successful deployment of the walk through metal detectors currently available.

3.	Quality Assurance: Evidence of current ISO 9001:2000 or internationally recognized equivalent quality assurance standard compliance.  All interested parties must be ISO 9001:2000 or have an internationally recognized equivalent quality assurance standard at the time of test article submission.  

4.	Point of Contact:  Company name and address, responsible individual, phone number and e-mail address.

5.    Security:   A signed copy of the Enhanced Metal Detector (EMD) Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Please send an email to adam.freimanis@dhs.gov and melissa.conley@dhs.gov requesting this form.

6.   Test Piece:  Each potential vendor will be required to enter into a bi-lateral bailment agreement.  This agreement will cover the policy for the loaning of equipment to the TSA for testing and will document the policies for the distribution of the MOCK-1E test piece.

This procurement action will be restricted to those companies that have been determined by the Government, based on information provided in their response to this announcement to be viable suppliers of walk-through metal detectors (a.k.a. EMD).  Failure to provide complete and accurate data or not being able to meet any of the requirements of Steps 1-6 may result in the vendor being disqualified from the EMD2 process

Step-2	For the companies that TSA deems eligible for the competition, the TSA will distribute the Test Requirements Kit (TRK).  The TRK includes but not limited to:  the password to the EMD Technical Requirements Document (TRD), the Management Plan for EMD Qualification Testing, and a Metal Object Calibration Kit (MOCK-1E).  TSA will distribute the TRK to the select companies within approximately three business weeks after the due date for the white papers.  A security check may be performed on each “selected” company prior to release of TRK.  The Government reserves the right to adjust the TRK distribution date.

Step-3	Offerors wishing to participate after review of the TRK, must submit up to three (3) units for the TSL test, conforming to the TRD (at no cost to the TSA) and a qualification data package (QDP) not to exceed 15 pages (12 pt font, 1 inch margin and 8.5 x 11 paper) providing evidence of conformance to the minimum requirements in the TRD.  The response date for completed QDPs will be approximately 90 days after release of the TRK.  The MOCK-1E must be returned with the unit samples and QDP or the Offeror’s submission will not be considered for award.	The submission date for the test units will be one week after the successful submission of the QDP.

Offerors wishing to participate in the test process must provide evidence of current ISO 9001:2000 or internationally recognized equivalent quality assurance standard compliance prior to the start of TSL testing.  The official testing start date will be provided in conjunction with the release of the TRK.

Those companies not wishing to participate must return the MOCK-1E within 5 business days. Companies must send an e-mail to adam.freimanis@dhs.gov indicating this intention and destroy all copies of the TRD and the Management Plan for EMD Qualification Testing.  In addition to returning and signing an NDA, all potential vendors will be required to sign a Bailment Agreement with the TSA.  The bailment agreement will be distributed on the request of the individual vendors and will document the additional ramifications for not returning the MOCK-1E not specified in this announcement.

Those companies having questions regarding this solicitation must submit them not later than ten (10) business days after the posting date of this notice via e-mail to:   adam.freimanis@dhs.gov & melissa.conley@dhs.gov 

Step-4	TSA will conduct a QPL certification field test for Offerors who return the MOCK-1E test kit and have successfully completed the TSL test.  The amount of units, to be supplied at no cost to the Government for the QPL field test, will be provided in the TRK.

Step-5	TSA will distribute an RFP (Request for Proposal) to all venders whose product(s) are placed on the QPL.  Placement on the QPL does not guarantee receipt of contract.    

Step-6	TSA will provide a pre-proposal conference within fifteen (15) days of RFP release.

This announcement is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This announcement does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses.  Only proposals from qualified Offerors will be evaluated for award.  Inclusion to the QPL does not guarantee receipt of contract.

Note: Priority and “express” mail delivery times(to include FedEx, UPS, DHL and others) to the TSA are usually 3-4 days longer than standard  delivery times for these  types of mail.  Standard USPS mail generally arrives as fast if not faster than all other types of mail.   White papers can be mailed, dropped off at TSA HQ or sent electronically. To mail white papers send them to:

2. There are inconsistent references to whether the PACS network system is to be furnished by BCH or by the contractor.

RESPONSE: The PACS network and associated software is to be provided by the contractor. The contractor must provide an HL7 interface to the BCH’s Electronic Health Record (EHR) in order to transmit written reports into the EHR.   

3. Please provide technical specifications for the PACS system currently in place at BCH.

RESPONSE: The computed radiology (CR) unit at the BCH is a Fuji Film SmartCR FCR XG-1 with Dicom catapult connectivity.

4. How long are images received by the contractor to be stored?

RESPONSE: The length of storage at the contractor’s facility shall be in accordance with Indian Health Service Records Management policies and regulations. The images must be stored for five years after the date of the last exposure and after a report has been filed in the patient’s medical record. Images that are unidentifiable, unserviceable, or otherwise unusable for diagnostic purposes because of faulty exposure are to be disposed of immediately.

5. Please provide additional detail about the distribution of cases, such as mix of cases; weekday vs. weekend; type of read by day of week, time of day, etc.

RESPONSE: The estimated number of procedures performed at the BCH, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, is 16,450 with a 3% to 5% increase each year. The majority of the procedures will be done Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to midnight. However, weekend and holiday reads/interpretations will be required and may range from 6% or more of the total volume. The following estimates are for informational purposes only.

(a) Ultrasound is 1,966; 
(b) Mammography is 1,285; 
(c) Diagnostic (including Fluoroscopy) is 11,380; and 
(d) Computerized Tomography is 1,819. The TOTAL is 16,450

6. Does the RFP call for the same scope of work as is being currently performed by the incumbent? If not, please describe how it differs from the current contract.

RESPONSE: It is basically the same, with the exception of the current scope of work authorizing the contractor to utilize a certified Radiologist PA.

7. Will offers to provide a certified radiologist PA for onsite requirements receive the same evaluation score as an offer to provide a radiologist onsite?

RESPONSE: Yes, since the Indian Health Service is authorizing the contractor to propose either discipline. However, the points received for this evaluation factor will be based on how the offeror addresses its ability to provide technical support with a licensed professional radiologist or certified radiologist PA.

8. Transcription? Do we provide or does IHS? What file format is acceptable?

RESPONSE: The contractor is responsible for providing transcription services. This requirement can be found in subsection C.2. The dictated reports must contain patient specified data; i.e., name, age, sex, date and time of procedure, medical record number, procedure name, name of attending physician, procedure findings, name of dictating radiologist, and date and time procedure was dictated by the radiologist.

9. Mammography needs to be defined as being of film screen (not digital) and will be delivered to contractor by facility within (x) amount of days for interpretation.

RESPONSE: Film screen interpretations will be performed for mammography procedures with a 4-day turnaround time from receipt of the film by the contract facility from BCH. Since the film screen is not digital it will not be transmitted to the contractor over the PACS network.

10. PACS Archive/Transcription fee per exam. There is no mention of this anywhere in the RFP.

RESPONSE: The fees associated with the PACS archiving and transcription services include the cost of archiving radiography, fluoroscopic, ultrasonography and computerized tomography procedures, and transcription of professional interpretation and report distribution.
 
11. The RFP doesn’t state whether the contractor can subcontract any of these services without the written consent of the facility.

RESPONSE: Generally, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, is incorporated in solicitations and resultant contracts that offer subcontracting possibilities and that are expected to exceed $500,000, total aggregate amount. The regulation requires the contractor to submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan that separately addresses subcontracting with small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. In the matter of the subject services and before the solicitation was released, the Indian Health Service made a determination in accordance with FAR 19.705-2(b) that the requirement for a subcontracting plan did not exist as the firms engaged in the business of furnishing professional radiology and teleradiology services maintain sufficient in-house capabilities to perform the work. If your facility intends to subcontract any portion of the services this information should be included in your technical proposal. A subcontracting plan will then be requested from the successful offeror prior to award.

12. The RFP doesn’t state whether the subcontractor needs to fulfill the requirements of the Governments Central Contractor Registration.

RESPONSE: Prime contractors are not required to have their subcontractors register in the CCR. If a primes subcontractor wants to bid directly for contracts with the federal government then it should be registered in the CCR. See http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.asp#Welcome.

13. The RFP should be identified as Professional Radiology Services.

For clarification purposes, the Indian Health Service intends to contract for Professional Radiology and Teleradiology Services for the Blackfeet Service Unit, PHS Indian Hospital, Browning, Montana.

B. The date and time specified for receipt of proposals is extend to 2:00 p.m., Monday, July 24, 2006.

C. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO EXTEND THE DATE FOR RESPONSES TO THIS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION TO JULY 19, 2006.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Ocean Service, Office of Coast Survey (OCS), has a requirement for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to perform rapid-response hydrographic-quality side scan sonar survey of port areas.  OCS requires an AUV that could be deployed in conjunction with manned surface assets to provide a rapid response capability for underwater domain awareness of ports, harbors, and inland waterways.  NOAA has a manned surface capability consisting of a 29-foot hydrographic survey launch equipped with multibeam and side scan sonar.  The survey launch is operated by a two or three person crew.  The operational concept is to use the AUV to augment the capability of the manned surface vessel to detect and map cubic features as small as 30 centimeters in water depths up to 100 meters.  The AUV would be deployed to perform baseline surveys, investigate targets in areas previously surveyed by the surface vessel or other resource, or survey potentially dangerous areas.  The autonomous vehicle will be operated by the crew of the survey launch with minimal or no shore-based support facilities.  The goals of using an AUV are, primarily, to provide standoff capabilities for the safety of the manned assets, and, secondarily, to increase survey efficiency and coverage.  

The technical requirements of AUV are detailed in the attached Statement of Work, Autonomous Hydrographic Survey Vehicle, dated June 21, 2006.  This requirement is set aside for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334511 and the applicable size standard is 750 employees.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the qualified responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the requirements of this solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.    Award will be based on an integrated assessment of offers using all evaluation factors.  If an award is made, it will be to the responsible Contractor that offers the best value to the Government.  The evaluation factors, although relatively equal, are listed in order of importance:    
•	Approach – The likelihood of effectively meeting requirements
•	Past Performance – The relevance and quality of prior performance
•	Price – The amount, realism, and consistency of the evaluated price

An adjectival method will be used to rate each factor:
•	Outstanding – Clearly demonstrates the full scope of the requirement for a comprehensive system solution
•	Good – Beneficial and worthwhile; sound and valid
•	Adequate – Reasonably sufficient and suitable
•	Marginal – Minimally suitable at the lower limit
•	Unsatisfactory – Not sufficient, not enough, disappointing

Responses must be sent electronically in MS Word format to Pauline.Jaffe@noaa.gov and in paper to Pauline Jaffe, Contract Specialist, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, 1305 East West Highway, Suite 7608, SSMC4, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910, no later than 11:00 am, local time, on July 19, 2006.  The applicable terms and conditions for the resulting purchase order are current through FAC 2005-09 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Interested contractors are hereby advised that contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Please register with CCR at the following website:  http://www.ccr.gov.  Questions regarding this requirement shall be submitted electronically to Pauline.Jaffe@noaa.gov.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.               

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.     The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on the prevention and control of diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus).     This includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of vaccines, therapeutics and medical diagnostics; as well as clinical studies to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.

To build upon the objectives of the NIAID Genomics programs (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/genomes/) and address the Institute’s need to further expand the knowledge of the proteome, NIAID is looking to establish 2 large scale Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases that will apply state-of-the art high-throughput (HTP) structural biology technologies to experimentally characterize the three dimensional atomic structure of targeted proteins from pathogens in the NIAID Category A-C priority lists (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm) and organisms causing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The scope of the Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases is to create a collection of high quality, experimentally determined three-dimensional structures that is widely available to the scientific community and serves as a blueprint for development of structure-based drugs, vaccines and diagnostics for infectious diseases. The three dimensional structure of proteins can assist drug design and development by yielding direct insights into the target molecular mechanisms, in interaction with other biological molecules, or with synthetic compounds, in order to improve selectivity, specificity and optimize drug development in a rational way.  

The primary focus of the Structural Genomics Centers shall be pathogen targets that are expected to have an important biological role and a potential impact on biomedical research, such as: 

Proteins involved in pathogenesis, such as invasins, adhesions, toxins; Proteins essential to the pathogen’s life and reproductive cycle; Proteins involved in antimicrobial/drug resistance; Protein markers of acute or chronic infection; Complexes with natural substrates, cofactors, receptors, drug candidates; Protein splice variants, post-translational modifications and other functionally characterized variants.

HTP structure determination is a complex scientific and technical process that includes target selection, cloning, expression and purification, sample preparation for X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray and NMR data collection, structure solution and validation. Pathogen targets shall be proposed by external investigators, NIH, other Government agencies, and the Contractor. The Contractor is expected to provide NIAID with established operational facilities, infrastructure, and scientific and technical expertise to perform in a HTP manner every component of the protein structure determination process. 

The Center shall provide to the broad scientific community by making available its technologies, resources and staff expertise to determine the structure of targets and deposit that information into the public domain. The Center must maintain productivity, quality and costs for structure determination that are competitive with those of similar HTP Structural Genomics Centers,  such as the Large-Scale Centers funded by the NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) under the second phase of the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI-2) http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Initiatives/PSI/. NIAID is committed to release into the public domain the results of the structural genomics projects in a timely fashion. It is anticipated that the Contractor will follow the guidelines established by the NIGMS-PSI large scale Centers for structural genomics. Those guidelines currently state that the atomic coordinates of the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules and associated data shall be deposited and released into the public domain within 4 weeks from completion of the structure determination project.

The Government anticipates multiple awards.  It is anticipated that the duration of the contracts will be a maximum of five (5) years; however, the length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  

Small business and 8(a) contractors are reminded that in order to quality as a set-aside, 51% of the direct labor must be performed by the prime contractor.  It is anticipated that an anticipated total effort of approximately 29.75 FTEs will be needed to accomplish this project. Interested organizations should submit three (3) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  Interested organizations presenting a capability statement in response to this sources sought announcement must identify their size status.  Written capability statements should be received by the NIAID Contracting Officer by July 21, 2006.  Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls or facsimiles will be accepted. E-mail transmissions will be accepted.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  See Government-wide numbered note 25.

The range is to consist of multiple lanes, with ten protective apparatuses concealing and presenting twelve targets in each lane as dictated by pre-programmed scenarios. The apparatuses shall consist of AR 500 steel protector plates, 19in.W x 39in .L or 36in.W x 84in.L, mounted on stabilizing equipment provided by the contractor, at the necessary heights to resemble standing or kneeling enemy targets or door-like structures. The targets shall consist of AR 500 steel 8in. circular plates. Each lane s hall contain five standing apparatuses which fully present an 8in. circular plate at the top of the apparatus, 3 kneeling apparatuses which also fully present an 8in. circular plate at the top of the apparatus, and 2 door apparatuses which fully present on e of two 8in. circular plates on either side of the apparatus to simulate a person popping their head out to either side of a door, window, or wall. The standing apparatuses shall be 6ft. (six feet) tall to the top of the fully presented circular plate, an d consist of one circular plate and one 19 x 39 protector plate mounted on a contractor-designed and furnished stand so the entire structure can stand alone under hits from 5.56 to 9 mm rounds and/or 60 mph winds. The kneeling apparatuses shall be 47in. ta ll to the top of the fully presented circular plate, and consist of one circular plate and one 19 x 39 protector plate positioned directly on the ground but stabilized by contractor-designed and furnished equipment so the entire structure can stand alone u nder hits from 5.56 to 9 mm rounds and/or 60 mph winds. The door apparatuses shall consist of the 36 x 84 protector plate, positioned directly on the ground, and two circular plates  one which will be 3ft. 6in. from the ground to the bottom of the circula r plate when fully presented on one side of the protector plate, and one which will be 60in. (five feet) from the ground to the bottom of the circular plate when fully presented on the other side of the protector plate. The door apparatuses shall also be s tabilized by contractor-designed and furnished equipment so the entire structure can stand alone under hits from 5.56 to 9 mm rounds and/or 60 mph winds. All apparatus stands and/or stabilizing equipment shall also be AR 500 steel. All apparatuses shall al so include hidden handles to enable mobilization by no more than four soldiers. Each of the apparatuses described above shall also include automated target mechanisms as necessary to present the 8in. circular plates as indicated. All target mechanisms must  be tropical weatherproof (100% humidity and temperature ranges from 30°F and 120°F) and mounted behind the protector plates so as not to be visible from any position on the line of fire. The 8in. circular plates must be attached to the target mechanisms b y a method other than welding, and must be removable in less than 2 minutes. The circular plates shall pop up or out from the hidden position to full presentation in no more than 0.50 seconds and must react differently when hit than when timed out. When th e circular plates sustain a hit or are timed out, they must return to the hidden position in no more than 0.50 seconds and automatically reset. The 8in. circular plates shall remain fully presented for a minimum of 0.50 seconds and shall be adjustable in i ncrements of 0.25 seconds for longer exposure times. The circular plates  in coordination with the automated target mechanism - shall take a hit anytime they are exposed and react to 99% of hits taken. Any form of power (excepting solar) or data communica tion can be used. All wiring and/or pneumatic lines shall be installed above ground on rocky or sandy earth, on the left side of each lane when facing

<ARCHDATE>08042006
<CONTACT>Sharon Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 427-1781, Fax 301 427-1740, Email sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to the Center for Health Care Strategies (CHCS) to continue to support the National Health Plan Collaborative (NHPC).  This is a market survey to determine if, in fact, CHCS is the only qualified source for this effort.  The NHPC, which began in 2004 and is jointly sponsored with The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, involves nine health plans working to address issues of racial and ethnic disparities in health care in their enrollees. In its initial phase, the NHPC facilitated the efforts of health plans to: (1) support health plan leadership in building support for health disparities reduction activities; (2) obtain primary data on or estimates of the race and ethnicity of their members to better identify potential disparities; (3) develop and test pilot interventions to reduce disparities; (4) develop novel approaches to focus interventions in areas or populations with the potential for the greatest positive impact; (5) measure the impact of those interventions; and, (6) communicate the outcomes of the NHPC.  The next phase of the NHPC will expand and accelerate  the current work; facilitate coordinated activities where plans can work collectively to reduce racial and ethnic disparities; and, identify and gather promising and innovative concepts in measurement, data analysis, outreach and interventions by health plans and/or their partners, to reduce racial and ethnic disparities. 
The Center for Health Care Strategies (CHCS) is a national non-profit organization devoted to improving the quality of health care services for vulnerable populations, especially those with chronic conditions. Over the past decade it has established itself as a leader in providing training and technical assistance to purchasers and health plans and in promoting innovative and the spread of best practices. Most of its work is done through operationally and results oriented learning collaboratives involving multiple stakeholders, sponsoring organizations, and expert faculty partners.
During the first phase of National Health Plan Collaborative (NHPC), quality improvement approach designed by CHCS and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) generated documented results in improved measurement, data collection and analysis, outreach and interventions. The CHCS has established strong working relationships with a number of key partners, including the co-sponsors, RAND, IHI, Greer Margolis (GMMB), Mathematica, and the Association of Health Insurance Plans (AHIP). The CHCS staff has established strong and productive relationships with all of the participating health plans, including their leadership representatives. Moreover, CHCS has both the qualitative and quantitative data collected and analyzed during the first phase of the collaborative. We know of no other learning organization that has these relationships and data; has already established appropriate operational work groups and committees; and, has the experience and expertise required for the next phase of the NHPC. 
The proposed acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  It is anticipated that one award will be made with a period of performance of two years.  Award of the contract is expected in September 2006.  AHRQ seeks a contractor with the proven capacity to:  (a) support cross-health plan collaborative efforts and learning to make the business, economic and social case for quality, (b) to manage cross-health plan collaborative testing of administrative practices and quality improvement interventions at the provider and member level; (c) to facilitate joint, coordinated health plan initiatives; and (d) to work with multiple sponsors as well as multiple partners with complementary expertise such as data collection, analysis and intervention support and expertise in provider quality improvement.  Interested organizations capable of performing the above and with the requisitie qualifications and expertise should submit, no later than July 20, 2006, a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the requirements as described above.  Capability statements should be no longer than 10 pages and may include appendices (for resumes, etc.) which do not count toward the 10 page limitation.  Capability statements should be submitted electronically to Sharon Williams at sharon.williams@ahrq.hhs.gov or hard copies (original and two copies) may be sent by mail to Sharon Williams, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD  20850.  A determination by the Government to compete or not to compete this requirement is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation or Request for Proposal is currently available.

<DESC>The Government is interested in assessing the performance envelope of Electrothermal Swing Adsorption (ESA) technologies that can be used to provide air filtration of toxic gasses and vapors.  ESA is a cyclic process where the adsorbent is regenerated by direct Joule Heating.  ESA allows for a smaller mass of adsorbent and more rapid cycling when compared to conventional adsorption.

The Government contemplates a program (Regenerative 5 CFM ESA Air Filtration Modules) consisting of 2 phases.  The first phase is expected to be 12 months.  The total program length is expected to be up to 2 years.  The objective at program’s end is for the components, as well as the entire system, to be made available commercially.  The 2 phases are described below.
Phase I:  The construction of two each 5 Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM) regenerative air filter modules that include adsorbent optimized for removal of chemical warfare agents and toxic materials.  The ESA technologies using novel adsorbent shall be capable of performing the separations of compounds that are weakly adsorbed onto conventional carbon, such as NH3, SO2, H2S, etc.  The technology shall be capable of performing the separation of all classes of weakly adsorbed toxic materials simultaneously and shall be completely regenerable, requiring no consumables for extended operation.  The capability of performing this type of separation shall be at a scale suitable to supply purified air for one person, approximately 5 CFM.  The filter modules shall be less than 0.85 cubic feet in volume and weigh less than 21 pounds each.  They shall be capable, when operated in tandem, of removing a continuous challenge of 2000 ppmv of HCN, H2S, NH3, and SO2 with 99.9% efficiency.
Phase II:  Optimization, refinement, and scaling of the design for prototype testing.  

Interested parties may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOCs), reflecting their interest and capability in meeting the requirements stated above.  

Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, as outlined above in Phase I, and on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineers and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer; (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration; (4) A statement regarding industry security clearance; and (5) Any other specific and pertinent information as it pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.

Submissions of SOCs are due electronically, no later than 28 July 2006, to the following e-mail addresses:
mark.wade@wpafb.af.mil
patrick.sullivan@tyndall.af.mil

Address contractual questions to Mark Wade, Contract Negotiator, at (937) 255-5402.
Address technical questions to Patrick Sullivan, Program Manager, at (850) 283-0430.

The IBM faceplate is going to be used to retrofit Lenovo\IBM workstations. This item will be used to cover the removable hard drive case. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department?s DS approved process nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the classified and unclassified network. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the item must be an IBM brand name unit and provided by an IBM reseller IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the IBM faceplate part number 26K1104 as a key component of the Department?s networking system. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the classified and unclassified network. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department?s requirements as a key component of the Department?s networking system.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. 64PP-6-0001 is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 325414.  This is being fully set-aside for small business.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, ARS, MWA, Plant Genetics Research Unit, Columbia, MO has a requirement/need for the construction of a normalized plasmid cDNA library and the subsequent sequencing of 15,000 ESTs, from Sprorobolus stapfianus leaves.  The starting material will be provided by Plant Genetics Research Unit, Columbia, MO.  CLIN No. 1 – Construction of a normalized plasmid cDNA library.  CLIN No. 2 – EST Sequencing.  CLIN No. 3 – Delivery of a glycerol stock of the transformed cDNA library.  THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  the construction of a normalized plasmid cDNA library and the subsequent sequencing of 15,000 ESTs, from Sprorobolus stapfianus leaves must meet or exceed these minimum requirements  (1) Must construct a normalized cDNA library from total Sprorobolus stapfianus RNA derived directly from material or provided by PGRU researchers.  cDNA synthesis should be of high efficiency and quality and utilize a rare restriction enzyme site contained in Primer Adapter sequence to increase cloning efficiency and ensure directionality.  cDNAs must be subjected to size selection.  No adapter ligation is to be used to construct the library (this can be achieved if an appropriate rare cutter restriction site is contained in the primer adapter used for cDNA synthesis).  A positive control should be used to monitor each step of library construction including overall efficiency.  A high copy number plasmid containing a suitable multiple cloning site must be used to generate the library.  The vector containing T7 promoter and SP6 promoter sites, an F1 phage origin of replication and an ampicillin resistance gene will be used.  The manufacturer must deliver a minimum of 3 x 106 primary clones (cfu) with an average inserted cDNA of greater than 1.0 kb in size and a minimum of at least 87% of the clones containing inserts.  (2)  EST Sequencing (sequencing of inserts).   Manufacturer will provide colony picking of 15,000 clones from the library for DNA purification and subsequent sequencing.  Sample genealogy and quality parameters should be tracked on a well-by-well basis to ensure accurate sample tracking and data quality, to give confidence in the integrity of the sequence data.  The tracking system should allow real-time assessment of pipeline success rates, quality scores, overall signal strengths and read lengths to maintain optimum performance and maximize sequence quality.  A passing sequence read should match the National Human Genome Research Institute’s standard definition; that is an attempt that yields a minimum of 100 PHRED 20 bases.  The expected quality should have pass rates for high copy plasmids of 85-90% with average Phred 20 read-lengths of 550-650 bp standard read type.  Manufacturer will deliver sequence data as trace files (.scf or .ab1).  A standard nomenclature system will be utilized: “CustomerAssignedPlateName”_”Well ID”_F or R. FileType”.  In addition, sequence files (.seq) and quality files (.qual) in FASTA format will be made available.  Preferably all information can be transferred via FTP.  (3) Manufacturer will deliver a glycerol stock of the transformed cDNA library.  The customer will receive glycerol stocks of normalized library in addition to the primary library if remaining after the normalization process. Manufacturer will also deliver any arrayed library plates that were generated for downstream sequencing by the Manufacturer.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Solicitation Number HSCG40-06-Q-41561. 
1. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION:  This is a justification for the procurement of various Paxman Parts, as a commercial item acquisition, utilizing other than full and open competition procedures.  The various Paxman Parts are for engine model numbers manufactured by Man B&W Ltd., and installed on Coast Guard vessels and application. Only Paxman engine parts manufactured by or under contract to Man B&W Ltd. are acceptable to use in the overhaul of the Paxman Valenta engins, Model 16RP200m. The Paxman engine parts are manufactured using proprietary engineering information and are constructed in such a manner that only authorized distributors can supply this requirement. There are NON-Paxman engine parts that are acceptable to use on the overhaul of aforementioned Paxman engines. These parts are ones that have previously been supplied by a vendor and successfully used for overhaul of the same Paxman Valenta engines. Viking INC is the only acceptable supplier, who is not an authorized distributor of MAN B&W Ltd. 2.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The Coast Guard currently has a requirement these various Paxman parts in accordance with current OPEM specifications utilizing genuine OEM Parts.  The ELC anticipates awarding a firm fixed price type contract “only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements”. 3. APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  Man B&W Ltd.,is the only known company possessing the original drawings, specifications, engineering  control procedures and proprietary methods to ensure the latest design configuration, manufacturing and quality control required to produce parts to current engineering specifications and requirements. 4. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL SOURCES: Documentation available is not sufficient to provide for a competitive solicitation.  Paxman is not willing to sell the rights to its drawings and manufacturing data. Man B&W Ltd., the OEM of the parts, has proprietary rights to the  engineering drawings and specifications used to manufacture the parts.  Further, the scope of manufacturing special tools, and equipment required to manufacture the various parts are unknown.  5.  FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  The Contracting Officer anticipates that the cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable and consistent with previous purchase of same items and the Independent Government Estimate (IGE). FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  There are no known appropriate substitute parts for Paxman engine parts and only one known authorized supplier Man B&W LTD.

Statement of Work:
A.  BACKGROUND
The Congressional Research Service (CRS), a service unit of the Library of Congress, works exclusively for the United States Congress, providing research, analysis, and information support to the members and committees of the House and Senate.  These services are provided by a highly educated staff of policy analysts, information specialists, and other professionals.

The mission of CRS is to provide to the Congress, throughout the legislative process, comprehensive and reliable legislative research, analysis and information services that are timely, non-partisan, and confidential, thereby contributing to an informed national legislature.  The vision of CRS is that the Congress turns to CRS first when it is in need of legislative, research analysis or information in addressing the issues of the Nation.  As an organization, CRS has adopted the values of client service, uncompromising integrity, total quality, mutual respect, and diversity.

As part of its ongoing efforts to ensure that CRS provides the highest possible quality of support to the Congress, CRS carries out a comprehensive training program to improve the knowledge base of CRS staff in a number of areas, including best practices in mentoring.

In 1999, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) Director established a Working Group to focus on mentoring activities that would further the Service’s goal to enhance diversity and to assist with succession planning.  This Working Group recommended the establishment of a formal CRS Mentor Program that would provide guidance to new employees by more experienced employees and facilitate support from management and staff to carry out that instruction.

As a result of their work, the Working Group recommended that the CRS Mentor Program develop a high quality, diverse workforce that values information exchange and encourages a creative and productive work environment.  The principle vehicle for this program commitment was that new employees would work closely with more experienced employees who would serve as role models to help new hires work effectively, make personal adjustments, and move forward in his/her careers.

B.  SCOPE OF WORK
To ensure that CRS staff have the training and tools they need to provide the highest quality analytical work for the Congress, CRS requires assistance in developing and delivering: (1)  on-site, customized Mentor/Mentee training as part of the implementation of the Mentor Program in CRS; (2) customized orientation to the CRS Mentor Program for the CRS Research Policy Council (RPC); and (3) a Mentor/Mentee Handbook based upon the customized mentor/mentee training program -- to be used as a training guide for new employees hired after the initial training program has been delivered.

C.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
The target audience for the Mentor/Mentee training will be the mentees –  newly hired CRS staff, including but not limited to analysts, attorneys, information specialists, and administrative personnel;  and mentors – experienced CRS employees.  The target audience for the customized orientation to the Mentor Program will be the Resource Policy Council (RPC) – senior level managers.
The learning objectives for the Mentor/Mentee training that must be met include, but are not limited to:
•Understanding the goals of the mentoring relationship in the context of CRS’s Mentor Program;
•Understanding mentoring, i.e., what it is and isn’t;
•Understanding the roles/responsibilities and expectations of mentors and mentees;
•Understanding the steps in establishing a meaningful mentoring relationship in initiating the mentoring process;
•Identifying a process for helping mentees solve problems; and
•Developing mentoring skills.
To provide the necessary assistance with this project, the contractor will: (1) meet with a representative group of CRS senior managers to assess CRS’s needs for course content, exercises, and case studies; (2) design a customized Mentor/Mentee training course; (3) design a customized orientation to the Mentor Program for CRS Resource Policy Council; (4) develop a customized Mentor/Mentee Handbook and course materials; (5)  present an orientation session for the RPC and  a pilot training course; 6) present up to three training courses that implement the final course design.
	
There will be approximately sixty (60) CRS staff members to be trained as part of the Mentor/Mentee training program.  This training may be in the format of either multiple half-day sessions or full day sessions, with up to fifteen (15) participants per course.  The contractor may propose the format.)

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a sponge blasting system.  The system will be a Sponge-Jet model B-Vac Pro or an offering of equivalent capability.  The system will be complete with all components required for use except media.  The entire system will operate from a user supplied air delivery unit.  The system will operate on a 125 psi, 750 CFM air supply.  There will be no electrical supply required for operation.  The system will consist of a feed unit, recycler/classifier unit, and a vacuum reclamation unit.  These units will be interconnected in such a way as to enable the operator to load the system with media via a vacuum hose, use the system to blast a component, and then vacuum the waste media to use for reclamation or rejection.  A 50’ long blast hose with a 1/2” nozzle and dead-man switch will be included.  The system will have a control panel with a single action emergency stop button, main air supply pressure gage, blast pressure gage, media supply pressure gage, blast and media feed pressure regulators, and a main air supply ball valve as a minimum.  There will be a 2” air supply with a 4-prong air fitting and a water separator.	This 2” connection will be the single-point pneumatic connection to the machine.  All air regulation, distribution, and flow control will be engineered into the system.  Any large volume air exhaust points, other than the blast feed, should have mufflers installed.  The entire system will be integrated into one steel-framed package and will be capable of transport via forklift. The feed unit will have at least 14 cu ft of vessel volume with an auger feed system.  The feed unit will be configured in such a way as to automatically refill from a hopper, and then reseal the pressure vessel via a pop-up valve.  The pressure vessel shall be protected with an appropriate pressure relief valve.  The recycler/classifier unit will process a minimum of 700 pounds of waste per hour.  It will separate the vacuumed material via screens into large waste, small waste, and reusable media.  The waste byproducts will be fed into two supplied 55 gal, steel waste drums.	It must reject any material larger than the sponge media that could pose a hazard.  The vacuum unit will have a suction capacity of at least 11” of Hg and 350 CFM.  It will not produce more than 80 dBA during operation.	It will include a HEPA filter and 50’ of clear vacuum hose. Any proposal of an alternate system must be accompanied by a complete set of support documentation to support an engineering evaluation of the offer.  The system must utilize media that consists of encapsulated abrasive material.	Conventional sand or grit blasting equipment is not acceptable and will not be considered.

(BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION)


1.  Requiring Activity:  OL-A AFCESA/CEMIRT				  
2.  Contracting Agency: 60th Contracting Squadron, Travis AFB CA
3.  Purchase Request #:  

4.  Description of Requirement:  Purchase five engine control panels along with communications control modules, and alarm/annunciator modules for installation on Caterpillar Model 3512, 750-kilowatt diesel generator sets.  The required panels are Caterpillar Electronic Modular Control Package II+ (EMCP II+; P/N: 151-5551); Caterpillar Communications Control Module (CCM; P/N: 164-8940); and Alarm/Annunciator module (P/N: 131-1961).  Estimated cost is $54,000. 

5.  Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  
     Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by: 

For Open Market Items:  FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).

Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.

6.  Justification or authority for action:

(a.)	The Caterpillar Electronic Modular Control Package II+ (EMCP II+) along with the Communications Control and Alarm/Annunciator Modules are specifically designed to provide a wide range of localized and remote control functions for Caterpillar generators. The EMCP-II+ incorporates every required control, monitoring and safety function necessary for the Caterpillar generators into one package.  The EMCP II+ is a direct replacement item for the obsolete analog engine panels that are currently on these generators.  They require no modifications to install and are designed to be plug and play components for the engine/generator and associated ancillary mechanical equipment and electrical switchgear.  The EMCP II+ also includes a micro-processor designed to interface with the Caterpillar POWERLYNX software and is the only control package designed to do so.
(b.)	Caterpillar is the only known source that can satisfy the government’s requirement.  There is no other product on the market designed specifically for this equipment.  It is imperative that the control package is fully compatible with the engine/generator, ancillary equipment and associated electrical switchgear and control software.
(c.)	Purchase of any other control package would require significant additional design and engineering expense to develop and adapt to the application.  In addition there would be costly and unacceptable project delays.

7.  Market Research/ Other Facts:  Additional Market research was not conducted.  Our technical experts are continually involved in the acquisition and installation of these products and are well aware of what is available.  Like Caterpillar, all other manufacturers have similar control packages designed specifically for their engine/generator sets and they are not interchangeable with others. 

8. Brand name manufacturer:  Caterpillar Inc.
	100 NE Adams Street
	Peoria, IL  61629-0002
 
9.  Steps to improve competition:  No efforts are being made at this time because this is a one-time acquisition.  If there are similar future requirements, additional market research will be conducted.

<DESC>A firm-fixed price commercial supply with incidental services requirement including Wrightline brand, with delivery and installation is required to support the volume of equipment, tools and supplies into the Bldg 230 space.  Modifications in the for m of new work tables and storage areas are required.  The Government is pursuing A Justification and Approval citing 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies Or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Wrightline is the pr oposed sole source GSA contractor.  The Government intends to issue a delivery order under GSA contract GS-29F-0100G to fulfill this requirement.  Wrightline is the only source to accomplish this requirement as existing Wrightline work benches and storage cabinets is inadequate to support the volume of equipment, tools, and supplies into the Bldg 230 space.  Purchase of Wrightline work benches and storage cabinets are needed to maintain uniformity and interchangeability with existing Wrightline work benches  and storage cabinets.  Therefore, it is imperative that HED is furnished with the Wrightline brand line, to ensure interchangeability of parts with the Wrightline work benches and storage cabinets.  The Government request that any interested GSA contracto r contact Ms. Linda Oshiro via email linda.n.oshiro@usace.army.mil by 13 July 2006, 4:00 P.M. Hawaiian Standard Time.

Each pulpit ladder has as its base rigid guide rollers on the sides of the four corners, which roll along the 42-inch wide shelving base closures, 2-inches above the floor surface, for smooth movement of the ladder in order not to bump and damage the shelved records.  All shelving base closures must be bolted or otherwise securely fastened to the shelving unit, at both ends.  The units will not become dislodged by the four guide rollers of the aluminum pulpit ladders during their movement in the aisles while servicing the stored records, or by common impact forces within the storage space.
