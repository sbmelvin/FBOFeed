The building will remain occupied during the project.  Building occupants and research operations must remain fully operational, but may be relocated.  

The CMc will assist the Government in managing the design and construction with an emphasis on meeting goals relating to schedule, budget, scope, and quality.  The CMc provides management, technical, administrative, and quality control services to achieve these goals, as well as for providing construction of the project.  The CMc is required to work with the Architect-Engineer and the Government in a cooperative team effort to develop a quality design.  The A-E will prepare and update all cost estimates for the cost of construction at each stage of the Construction Documents development.  The A-E is obligated to design the project within a specified cost limitation and the CMc will review, analyze, and assess each estimate and limitation and shall prepare a cost estimate report for each A-E design submission.  No later than the submission of the midpoint of construction document, the CMc will prepare their cost proposal for construction.  The cost proposal shall not exceed the estimated cost of construction and will be used by the Government and the CMc to establish a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).  Source selection procedures per FAR subpart 15.3 shall be utilized.  Evaluation of firms will be made on the following criteria:  (1) Relevant Experience; (2) Schedule and Resources; (3) Key Personnel; (4) Contract Administration; (5) Small Business Subcontracting Plan; and (6) Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Program. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.

The completion time is 24 months after the notice to proceed is issued.  The estimated price range for the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The NAICS code is 236220, with a size standard of $28.5 million.  This procurement will be conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program and using negotiated procedures.  Large Business firms will be required to submit a subcontracting plan with goals for small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned small, HUBZone small, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  A bid bond and Miller Act Performance and Payment Bonds will be required.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to Structural Reliability Technology (SRT) of Boulder, Colorado for the development of analytical software to support newly developed crack growth features of the WARP3D finite element code being developed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champain.  Pursuant to FAR 13.106-1, this requirement is considered to be reasonably available from only one source and competition is impractical for the following reasons:	 1.  SRT has the only commercially available software to perform automatic finite element meshing, pre-processing and post-processing of multiple crack geometries for structural analysis using WARP3D and other finite element codes.  The current capabilities of the SRT software allow analysis of stationary (not growing) cracks.  The meshing and pre- and post-processing developments to be furnished under the proposed procurement will greatly facilitate using the crack extension methodologies available and currently under development in the WARP3D research code.  SRT has the only compatible foundation of software from which to make these modifications.   2.  The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, under Grant NAG8-1751, is currently developing advanced crack growth methodologies for analysis of flight-critical structures under extreme loading environments.	The proposed software development is specifically designed to work with the MSFC funded developments of the WARP3D code to help the transition of WARP3D from a research tool into and engineering tool.	The NASA investment in the WARP3D code is significant and the subject investment required with SRT to bring the tool to the engineering community is a small, but crucial part of the overall development plan for the analysis software.   3.  It would take a significant amount of time and a significant investment for another source to develop software similar to that already developed by SRT.  Any other approach to satisfy the Government’s requirements would be significantly more expensive because the proposed approach leverages the investments already made by both SRT and the Government.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 29, 2003.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>17.	Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate/Power Division (AFRL/PRP) solicits research proposals for Power and Thermal Technologies for Air and Space.  The Power Division (AFRL/PRP) of the Air Force Research Laboratory Propulsion Directorate is soliciting proposals under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to develop, demonstrate and improve upon key power and thermal technologies supporting air and space applications in the areas of Power Generation, Power Management & Distribution, Energy Storage, and Subsystem Integration.  The technical improvements in these four areas will contribute toward meeting the Power Division's goals in the 2009 and beyond timeframe, and goals deemed necessary to facilitate nearer-term transition or transfer.   

Power and thermal technologies for aircraft support the integrated goals of the joint DoD/NASA/Industry More Electric Initiative.  Advanced power technologies support the initiative to develop directed energy weapons and place these weapons on airborne platforms.  The airborne use of directed energy weapons is driving the onboard electrical power requirements beyond the limits of conventional electrical power and thermal management systems and has driven the need to develop the necessary power generation, distribution and conditioning technologies required for the airborne use of these weapons.  Power technologies for space applications develop innovative technologies to reduce spacecraft size and weight, increase efficiency, increase operational life and develop affordable spacecraft.  

The over arching strategy of the BAA involves the use of a 7-year open-ended solicitation spanning the four major technology areas of Power Generation, Power Management and Distribution, Energy Storage and Subsystem Integration for Air and Space applications.  This strategy will provide AFRL/PRP an acquisition tool with the flexibility to solicit proposals and make awards to develop technologies to meet present and future Air Force needs on a “real-time” basis as ever-changing technology issues are identified.  

The BAA will remain “open” for 7 years; however, proposals will only be solicited and accepted during "calls".  Each call will identify solicitation topics and will contain a common cut-off date for proposal submission.  

The first “call” for proposals occurs with the issuance of this BAA.  Refer to Part 5 of the solicitation for detailed information concerning the Power and Thermal Technologies for Air and Space – Scientific Research Program.  This program will sponsor scientific research and early development of materials, thermal concepts, battery cells and others, in the following four major research areas in which problems frequently arise which require unique and innovative solutions: Power Generation, Power Management & Distribution, Energy Storage, and Subsystem Integration.  The anticipated funding for this program is $49M.

<SUBJECT>A--Comanche Elector Optical Sensor Suite (EOSS) Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) Windows
<SOLNBR>DAAH23-02-G-0024 0003
<RESPDATE>081803
<ARCHDATE>10172003
<CONTACT>Rhonda Clemons, 256-842-6525
<DESC>NA The Comanche Elector Optical Sensor Suite (EOSS) Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) windows have a durability requirement.  The Night Vision Pilotage System (NVPS) FLIR detector window is made from Germanium and is similar to the windows used on the Apache he licopter, but does not utilize a diamond hard coat due to the requirement for transmission uniformity over varied wavelengths and angles that current diamond hard coatings do not meet.  The second window, also referred to as the Electro Optical Target Acqu isition Sensor (EOTADS) window, is made from zinc selenide.  This material was chosen due to its transmission range over the required operating frequencies, despite its poorer mechanical properties relative to other window materials.  It is desirable to de velop a coating or alternate approach, e.g. utilizing removable films, that would extend the service life of the windows without sacrificing other performance requirements.  Phase I of this task will consist of sand and dust baseline durability testing of the current window materials, candidate replacement materials, and identification, selection, and durability testing of suitable films.  Phase II of the task will include continued durability testing for rain erosion on selected materials.  If none of the proposed replacement materials or film solves the durability issues, then Phase II would also include initial development of a suitable Ã¢Â€Âœdurable coating.Ã¢Â€Â  The authority cited for this requirement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federa l Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-01, Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement is sole source to Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Ã¢Â€Â“ Orlando (LMMFC-O), 5600 Sand Lake Road, Orlando, FL 32819-8907.  The Government does not have drawings or other technical data that would permit full and open competition for this effort.  This synopsis is for information purposes only.   Please see notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to negotiate with and issue a sole source modification to Dewolff, Boberg, and Associates (DB&A), 100 North Central Expressway, Suite 210, Richardson, Texas 75080, for additional consulting services, as part of a previously awarded Command-wide Efficiency Management and Productivity Improvement Consulting Services contract.  The resultant modification will add an approximate 1,100 manweeks of effort.  DBA has already begun the Command-wide study and as such holds significant knowledge of NAVSEA and affiliated Program Executive Office (PEO) procedures, contracts, policies, and organization.  The scope of work requires that the contractor evaluate NAVSEA processes, program management functions and duties, and government and contractor manpower needs.  As such, it is a requirement that the contractor be free from all potential conflict of interests, cannot be currently performing any other NAVSEA contract, and will be prevented from being awarded any future NAVSEA business.  DBA is in a unique position of never having held a NAVSEA contract, other than the current Command-wide Efficiency Management and Productivity Improvement Consulting Services contract and is excluded from performing any different type of future effort for NAVSEA.

<DESC>General:  The National Park Service, Denver Service Center, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, P.O. Box 25287, Denver, Colorado 80225 anticipates award of a firm-fixed price design-build contract based upon a two-phase selection procedure. This notice represents solicitation of qualification statements as Phase One of the two-phased selection approach. The scope of work includes the rehabilitation of the Square's landscaping, flagstone paving, brick retaining walls, walkways, site drainage, irrigation and lighting systems, improvement to the Square's handicap accessibility, and replacement to its furnishings.  The estimated price is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000, including all design and construction services, with the construction portion to be completed by Fall, 2005. The contract provides for the repair of paving and drainage systems, repair of existing walk lights and add new in-kind fixtures, prune trees to eliminate identified safety hazards and correct structural deficiencies, remove and where not practical abandon existing irrigation system piping, repair brick piers that have shifted from their original alignments, evaluate soil conditions and mitigate problems, re-sod all lawn areas, renovate and redesign existing shrub beds, repair/replacement of benches, bollards, and chains.  Funding has been secured for this project.  Design submittals and round table reviews will be required at approximately 35%, 65%, and draft 100% design stages.  As-built drawings will be required upon construction completion.  Although the site program has been largely defined through NPS schematic design efforts and performance specifications, the successful offeror will be required to meet with park staff to finalize the program.  All design-build firms responding to this notice will be given 15 days to provide qualifications for evaluation based upon the following criteria in descending order of importance: 1. Past performance which demonstrates understanding, design and construction experience applying the Secretary of Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation, particularly, the Secretary of Interior's Standards for the treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for the Treatment of Cultural Landscapes. 2. Past performance which demonstrates quality control and craftsmanship in historic preservation treatments of nationally and internationally significant private and public historic landscapes including sites with significant archeological resources.  3.  Past performance experience in cultural landscape historic preservation work specifically:  inventorying and documentation of existing materials for removal, repair and re-installation of historic fabric and materials; salvaging, handling and storage of built components, historic fabric and materials; actions/procedures to address the unexpected discovery of subsurface cultural resources; experience working with historic stone and brick masonry; experience and technical knowledge of vegetation protection and pruning, particularly during excavation. 4. Past performance which demonstrates experience with the design and construction of engineering systems including but not limited to:  irrigation systems, electrical and lighting systems, surface and subsurface drainage systems, excavation, heavy machinery operation, planting, and working in urban areas, specifically within the City of Philadelphia.  5. Past performance which demonstrates experience in scheduling and coordination of multi-trade work, maintaining public and Government access requirements, factoring work stoppages for scheduled ceremonies and activities, and the ability to meet timed use and vehicular/pedestrian circulation requirements in an urban area.  Demonstrated ability to effectively prepare and execute a critical path method schedule for projects of this type and size.  Design-build firms/teams which meet the requirements of this announcement are invited to submit an original only of Standard Forms 254 and 255, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, to the office indicated above for Phase One evaluation. The SF 254's and 255's are formatted for architect-engineer and related services. The construction element of the firm/team shall also be addressed on the SF 254 and 255. Only responses received by 3:45 p.m. local time on August 4, 2003, will be evaluated further. Two to five of the most highly qualified design-build firms will be short- listed to participate in Phase Two of this design-build selection process. In Phase Two, those firms short-listed will be sent a Request for Proposal (RFP) which will contain the NPS Schematic Design, performance specifications, and evaluation criteria for technical and firm-fixed price proposals. Offerors will be required to prepare a design proposal (for sustainable concepts, structural systems, floor plans, elevations and wall systems), and a management plan (describing management philosophy, schedule, team organization, quality control and safety), as part of the Phase Two technical proposals. A price proposal will also be required along with technical and management proposals.  Each offeror will be required to submit both a technical and price proposal within 30 days after receipt of the RFP based upon evaluation factors identified in the RFP. A stipend fee of $ 10,000 will be awarded to each offeror which provides a responsive, but unsuccessful initial proposal under Phase Two of this selection process. Award of a single contract will be made to the "best value" offeror by approximately September 2003. Debriefings will be made available after contract award. Because this acquisition could result in an award over $1,000,000, the selected firm will require a subcontracting plan, if the firm is a large business concern. Point of contact for inquiries and clarifications is Melinda Triplett, Contract Specialist, National Park Service, Denver Service Center, 12795 W. Alameda Parkway, P.O. Box 25287, Denver, CO 80225, telephone number (303) 969-2469. No collect calls will be accepted. Note: this is not an RFP. No telephone calls for solicitations will be accepted.

The estimated cost for design and construction of the project is between $7,250,000and $7,760,000. Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately five (5) offerors (design-build firms or teams) based on design-build factors that include:  FACTOR A-Past Performance, 1-Design Team, and 2-Construction Team; FACTOR B-Small Business Effort (Phase I); FACTOR C-Technical Qualifications, 1-Design Team and 2-Construction Team; and FACTOR D-Management Approach. There are no Plans and Specifications in Phase I. A maximum of five (5) firms will be selected to submit Technical and Price Proposals for Phase II and an amendment will be issued to those firms only.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project. Price proposals will include total evaluated price, such as, base proposal, options, and evaluation of scope/design options within the Governments published budget for award. The Government reserves the right to: reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government. PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND SELECT PHASE II OFFERORS WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.

Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS OR DOCUMENTATION. The Government intends to issue the Phase I Request for Proposals (RFP) electronically by posting it on the NAVFAC website, http://esol.navfac.navy.mil., on 29 January 2003. Phase I proposals will be due on 04 March 2003.  Offerors must register themselves on the Internet at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Utah is seeking qualified A & E firms or individuals to develop the agronomic/land treatment component of Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans (CNMPs). The work shall consist of providing technical assistance to Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) participants for the development of these plans. A CNMP is a grouping of conservation practices and management activities for confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and animal feeding operations (AFOs) which, when implemented as part of a conservation system, will help to ensure that both production and natural resource protection goals are achieved. 

A CNMP incorporates practices that:
	1) Uses animal manure, processes wastewater and other organic by-	products as a beneficial resource; 
	2) Addresses potential impacts of a CAFO/AFO on natural resources, 	especially water quality, and
	3) Assists a CAFO/AFO owner/operator in meeting all applicable local, 	Tribal, 	State of Utah, and Federal water quality goals and regulations. 

NRCS has identified a need to develop up to 20 Agronomy/Land Treatment CNMPs for CAFO/AFO facilities of EQIP program participants over the duration of this project. (Area One: 10, Area Two: 5, Area 3: 5)

CNMPs shall be developed in accordance with all applicable Utah-NRCS policy and criteria which can be found at:
 
Utah-NRCS CNMP Technical Guidance (after accessing the website, go to Section I/Reference Materials/CAFO/AFO Program/CAFO/AFO Materials): http://efotg.nrcs.usda.gov/popmenu3FS.aspx?Fips=49049&MenuName=menuUT.zip

Utah-NRCS Field Office Technical Guide: http://efotg.nrcs.usda.gov/popmenu3FS.aspx?Fips=49049&MenuName=menuUT.zip

CNMP development will require knowledge of conservation planning; an understanding of agronomy, engineering, soil conservation and water management practices; and good communication skills. CNMP Development will also require knowledge of the Utah Manure Application Risk Index (UMARI) and use of Utah-specific Excel spreadsheets. The respondents must demonstrate the ability to become certified Technical Service Providers (TSP) in the categories of CNMP Planning and Assistance and CNMP Approval within 45 days of contract award.

(4)CLINICAL WORKLOAD COMPILATION, MEDICARE AND MEDICAID COST ANALYSIS AND RATE ESTIMATING AND MANAGEMENT REPORTS gathered on workload information from several National IHS data sources and from each of the hospitals as the Medicare cost reports are being completed to identify key information on Medicaid and Medicare billable workload.  After the cost reports have been completed, the contractor summarizes certain cost report data elements and integrates key IHS workload data to form a basis to evaluate and analyze cost of delivering health care in IHS facilities and determine the cost of care for Medicare and Medicaid activities; and (5) CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL (CAH) ANALYSIS REPORTS AND TRAINING for the seven (7) current IHS CAHs and the thirteen (13) IHS hospitals that may convert to CAHs during fiscal year 2003 to include reports and analysis of the data with revenue projections, additional work to address audits by the Fiscal Intermediary, and  training and assistance to potential sites to aid in conversion to CAH.  The Government knows of only one source, Moore Consulting Group, who is adequately familiar with and has the unique knowledge of the special IHS requirements identified by the CMS.

Pursuant to 41 USC 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, this requirement has been justified in accordance with FAR 6.303.

<DESC>The Navy intends to procure system integrator services necessary to ensure that the four Navy Enterprise Resource Planning pilot projects (NEMAIS, SIGMA, SMART and CABRILLO) are interoperable and can be incorporated into one Navy enterprise design.  The period of performance for this effort is anticipated to be August 2003 through March 2004.  Efforts will include interoperability activities and lab services for integrating the pilot designs into a Navy standard template.  Functional processes include: financial management, program management, I-level maintenance, plant-level supply, wholesale supply, and human resource management.  The Navy intends to negotiate and award a delivery order under Blanket Purchase Agreement N00421-00-A-0351 with BearingPoint LLC as the prime contractor and IBM Global Services-Federal and Electronic Data Systems (EDS) as major subcontractors for the ERP System Interoperability effort.  BearingPoint, IBM, and EDS as the current Navy Enterprise Resource Planning Pilot System Integrators are uniquely qualified to provide the required effort.  The incumbent system integrators have closely worked over the last 36 months with the Navy in bringing the Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) SAP solution to the Navy customer base.  In that time they have gained expert knowledge in the Navy business processes and how those legacy business processes align to the SAP COTS industry best practices.  The current pilot integrators are the only companies with the background knowledge of the four Navy ERP pilots and the interoperability issues between them.  Only the BearingPoint/IBM/EDS team has the knowledge and experience to accomplish the ERP interoperability tasking in the timeframe required.  The Government point of contact for this acquisition is D. Mark Diehl, NAVAIR Contracting Officer, (301-995-4038).  Note 22

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Imaging Program (CIP)plans to procure design and development to upgrade Molecular Imaging Database (MOLI) support services from CambridgeSoft Inc., 2530 Meridian Parkway, 3rd Floor, Durham, NC 27713. The mission of this relational database is to provide a centralized, comprehensive repository of information about published molecular imaging reagents.  The MOLI database exists in a relational SQL format that is made accessible through the CambridgeSoft ChemOffice Webserver.  The existing MOLI system contains a limited number chemical structures with a minimal amount of supporting scientific information populating the existing fields.  These agents and a limited number of the fields are currently available for searching through a CambridgeSoft ChemOffice Webserver interface.  The Contractor will be required to assess the status of the existing MOLI System, modify the underlying structure and the web interface to enable electronic remote editing of existing agents and fields, modify the underlying structure and the web interface to enable electronic remote addition of the chemical structures of new agents and the text-based information associated with each agent, deploy the complete system to a publically-accessible webserver to make chemical and text-based searching functions readily available, and ensure that the MOLI database is compatible and fully functional on all standard PC and Macintosh operating systems and web browsers.  The MOLI database was designed using the ChemOffice WebServer as the software that makes the data electronically available through the Internet.  This proprietary software is critical to the continued functioning of the MOLI project.  The software is only available directly from CambridgeSoft, Inc..  The MOLI system is a highly complex relational database that relies on the sophisticated functions of the ChemOffice WebServer.  The CambridgeSoft Representatives have unique access to the proprietary programming that is the basis of the ChemOffice WebServer Package.  It is a highly sophisticated software package that is capable of the integration and searching of complex chemical structures and text-based data.  This function is absolutely required for the MOLI project.  In order for the MOLI system to be constructed as a robust system that will be widely and rapidly used by the public, the CambridgeSoft expertise is critical, and that technical support is only available directly through CambridgeSoft.   The system and services are considered commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  CambridgeSoft, Inc. is the only organization known that has the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement.  This statement must demonstrate that the proposed system is currently in place and operating on the Web.  The NCI will not consider statements that propose to develop a new system.  The statement and any other supporting information must be furnished in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party meets the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on July 24, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor&#61501;s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.   NAICS 541511

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

If that is the only thing that is making the system be quoted as wide bore, then it is something we can do without. 2.  Wide line solids is not required with the base system.  It is something we would like to be able to upgrade to later, but is not an absolute necessity. 3.  Diffusion is required as an upgrade - yes.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 339111   This amendment 1 to the original synopsis for Multi-Parameter Water Quality Data Sondes  posted 7/11/03 is revised as follows: The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with YSI, Inc., Fondriest Environmental, Inc., Alpha, OH, to provide multi-parameter  water quality sondes under the authority of FAR Part 6.302.1.  This equipment for the ORD/NRMRL/LRPCD is required to record in situ water parameters including chlorophyll, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, ph/ORP and water temperature and vented shallow water level which requires the capability of  simultaneously mounting two optical probes that are integral to the main body at the end of the instrument.  The equipment must perform unstirred pulsed dissolved oxygen measurements and have instrument digital internal identification codes for use to automatically identify data records specific to  each individual unit for QA purposes.  The equipment must be equipped with a vented level sensor that can provide water depth data that does not need to be corrected for barometric pressure changes following data retrievel.  The EPA believes that only YSI/Fondriest can provide this equipment.  THIS  NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing it can meet these requirements may submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  The documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete  the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is  beingprocessed under FAR Part 12.  The anticipated award date is August 15, 2003.  See numbered note 26.

<DESC>Please correct the following solicitation to read as:

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), is seeking capability statements from organizations to prepare three background papers and convene an expert panel for one and a half days in early Spring of 2004 for approximately 50 participates  on the topic of core competencies for practice in behavioral health care.   There is increasing recognition in the field of the need to identify these competencies and to structure education and training programs for the workforce around the development of these competencies.  The knowledge base regarding workforce competencies remains in an early stage of development.  The concept of competencies is usually not well defined.  The teaching strategies for developing and assessing competencies are often poorly articulated. The identification of competencies has generally been restricted to the compiling of “lists” of skills that a provider should processes. 

The performance of this simplified acquisition necessitates the following: (1) Knowledge of human resources issues in mental health and of key leaders in the field who can address the issues; (2) Demonstrated capability to organize the expert panel and demonstrated knowledge of key logistical issues; (3) Management and staff plan to assure the success of the project; and (4) Demonstrated capacity to prepare an initial project plan and a project final report. 

The anticipated period of performance for this simplified acquisition is for 20 months.

<DESC>This is a market survey only.  The US Army TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ anticipates soliciting a purchase order for the support to provide expert technical review and interpretation of technical documents relating to selected remedial investigation work plans, reports and feasibility studies.  The written reports shall be received by the Installation Restoration Advisory Board (RAB) at times and locations that will be determined and will, as appropriate, consist of a written analysis of the Remedial Investigation (RI) or Feasibility Study (FS) or other appropriate document, a briefing to the RAB and attendance at RAB meetings.  This requirement is to fill the need expressed by Picatinny Arsenal RAB to interpret results of various technical documents dealing with feasibility studies such as groundwater issues and the remediation of the burning grounds.  Requirements of the contractor shall include review of  documents supplied (work plan and RI/FS) as requested.  The contractor should be generally familiar with the requirements of the Installation Restoration  Program (IRP). Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability  Act (CERCLA), and New Jersey Technical regulations as they relate to Picatinny Arsenal, and will perform independent reviews of subject documents to determine the nature and extent of contamination, risks to health and environment, if data supports proposed remedy, rationale to support the remedy, and if the  proposal reflects the position of the RAB.  Additionally, responding firms  should be located within a 75-mile radius to Picatinny Arsenal and should have  environmental knowledge of most environmental cleanup issues at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ.  Additionally, respondents should have experience of the actual  sites of environmental issues at Picatinny Arsenal for which remediation will  be required and have an institutional knowledge of the past five (5) years.   This institutional knowledge allows the contractor to understand the  framework for decision-making and to convey the history of issues/sites at  Picatinny Arsenal to the RAB so they can clearly evaluate the issues at hand.   Institutional knowledge is necessary because the duplication costs for  research and knowledge would be costly to the Government.  This proposed requirement has an anticipated period of performance of 1 Base Year with 4  Option Years with a projected award in the 4th quarter FY03.  All responsible,  interested sources are asked to submit their qualifications and capabilities  in response to this market survey within 7 days to:  US Army TACOM-ARDEC,  AMSTA-AQ-APF, Bldg. 9, ATTN:   Lisa A.

<DESC>The government intends to acquire services with FormSoft  10863 Yankee Road, Dayton, OH 45458 for the modification of their FormFinder software. The modifications will support the integration of electronic SSA forms (Social Security Administration’s eForms) into the DDS operations. This is a multi phased project: (1) Proof-of-Concept Phase (a) determine whether the current Unix-based FormFinder software can be converted to run natively on IBM’s AS/400 platform (Operating System V5R1 and above, including standard PTFs. The AS/400 is often referred to as an iSeries/400.); (b) determine whether FormFinder software can be converted to efficiently interface with the DB2 database structure native to the AS/400. (2) Conversion Phase: (a) If the Proof-of-Concept phase is successful as judged by SSA, then convert the full functionality of the FormFinder software to run natively on IBM’s AS/400 (Operating System V5R1 and above, including standard PTFs); (b) make necessary conversions and/or utilize efficient processes to utilize the AS/400 DB2 database structure and to integrate the DB2 and Oracle database update and reporting processes so that when a form is updated on one system it will be available to all systems and form usage information will be available centrally. SSA reserves final approval as to whether any phase is successful and meets standards for efficiency.   A separate effort from the phased efforts related to the AS/400 conversion efforts is the modification of FormFinder software to provide a user interface that will hide the Internet Explorer toolbar and substitute a form specific toolbar that will be viewable to the IE user when the user accesses SSA’s eForms. This toolbar will provide functionality as defined by SSA’s Office of Earnings, Enumeration and Administrative Systems (OEEAS). The toolbar modifications will be available to users of FormFinder’s native software as well as the AS/400-compatible software, if conversion is achievable as defined above.  The vendor will need to arrange for access to an AS/400 development platform that supports the Disability Determination Services (DDS) hardware and software environments.   The vendor must have unfettered copyright and development access to FormSoft’s FormFinder software or other necessary copyright and development access belonging to FormSoft. The vendor must be able to deliver the phased deliverables in accordance with timelines required by SSA.   Interested vendors should submit their capability that certifies full and complete access to the FormSoft FormFinder software and their capability to provide the services required.   All documentation must reference LH-03-005 and submitted to Leslie Hyman at the address listed above by August 4, 2003.  No solicitation document exists and requests for copies of a solicitation will not be accepted.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKING LICENSEE TO COMMERCIALIZE SUBSTRATE THAT QUANTITATES DEPOSITED BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS WHILE COMPATIBLE WITH SERIAL ANALYSIS BY OTHER ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks to license this technology to industry.

Researchers at LLNL have developed an invention that relates to an apparatus and method for measuring the mass of molecules for accurate and sensitive mass quantitation of applied amounts of molecules on substrates while remaining compatible with multiple non-destructive and destructive methods of analysis known. 

The technology provides a method and apparatus that measures certain parameters and correlates that measurement to a quantitative measurement of the mass of an applied material. Such a method and apparatus remains compatible with the other methods of analysis to provide a complete suite of tools for researchers such as biochemists by identifying the macromolecule and quantifying the isotope and/or other elemental abundance of the same quantified aliquot.

Molecules in proteomic, biochemical, pharmaceutical or toxicological investigations can be adsorbed or deposited onto the surface for analysis by multiple methods (mass measurement, elemental analysis with x-ray fluorescence, identification with MALDI-TOF\MS, ligand quantitation with AMS, DNA comparison through PCR as well as others).

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's subject technology described herein should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

<SUBJECT>54 -- FPI to Offer Portable Housing Units/Disaster Relief Shelters
<DESC>In furtherance of the Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) Board of Directors' directive that FPI seek to create inmate jobs without mandatory source, a notice was published in the December 21, 1998 edition of the Commerce Business Daily regarding FPI's production of products for the Federal government on a competitive (non-mandatory) basis.  The notice stated that FPI's Board of Directors had granted approval for FPI to competitively bid on products for which it did not rely on its status as a mandatory source of supply.  Under this procedure, FPI would not follow the public involvement guidelines process established by 18 U.S.C. 4122(b) which is required for new products FPI offers as a mandatory source.

FPI is required to publish a notice of its intentions to competitively produce a product bought by the Federal government.  This notice announces FPI's intent to produce portable housing units/disaster relief shelters for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on a non-mandatory basis.

Portable housing units/disaster relief shelters encompass all items in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 5411 - Rigid Wall Shelters.  This product is a new requirement for FEMA, which approached FPI only after failing to identify any commercially available offerings which met all of the agency's needs.

A preliminary analysis by FPI reveals the manufacturing process for this product will be labor-intensive, which will result in more than 20 percent of the finished product's value being added by FPI.  In the manufacturing of this product, FPI will purchase all necessary materials and components from private sector suppliers.  In this effort, FPI will look first to vendors currently listed on General Services Administration (GSA) schedules, and will make every effort to utilize small business suppliers.

Pursuant to this proposal, once this product is sold as a non-mandatory item by FPI, it will never be added to FPI's Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time for portable housing units/disaster relief shelters, nor will it seek approval from its Board of Directors to expand production by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.

FPI's Board of Directors has determined that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a non-mandatory basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2).  Sales of portable housing units/disaster relief shelters will be tracked and recorded separately by FPI.

Interested parties may submit comments regarding the production of portable housing units/disaster relief shelters by FPI.
