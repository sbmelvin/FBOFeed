The NHDS is a continuous nationallly representative sample survey of inpatients discharged from hospitals.  The survey is the nation's principal source of data on inpatient utilization of short-stay, non-Federal hospitals; and is the only source of nationally representative estimates on the characteristics of discharges, the lengths of stay, diagnoses, surgical and non-surgical procedures,and patterns of care in hospitals in various regions of the country.

The estimated performance period for this project is sixty (60) months.
