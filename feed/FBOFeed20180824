<p>6 JUN 2000 - F3460198G00050048 - QTY 131 EA - CAGE 52661</p>
<p>QUALIFIED SOURCE(S): PRATT AND WHITNEY (52661)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 60 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.</p>
<p>While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer, Deborah Marks 405-855-7070, deborah.marks.2@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC), on behalf of the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), has a requirement for Research Support Services with the objective to develop, implement, use, and enhance the functionality of NHRC's Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) tools.  Such tools include: the Joint Medical Planning Tool (JMPT), the Medical Planner's Toolkit (MPTk), the Enterprise Estimating Supplies Program (EESP), and other military M&amp;S tools to design medical course-of-action analyses and studies in a distributed web-based environment for the entire range of operations.  National and Defense Planning Scenarios may be represented in the tool to address a variety of operational concepts.  The contractor shall develop the specifications for enhancing JMPT and for establishing and enhancing a common user database where data elements can be updated, added, and available for use in a variety of medical planning and logistical tools.  This includes defining and expanding the medical capabilities, determining the data elements and data relationships for forward resuscitative care and theater hospitalization required to conduct risk assessment, configure medical capabilities, evaluate emerging requirements, conduct mission rehearsal, and deliver training both CONUS and OCONUS. The contractor shall also develop a methodology and implementation algorithm of the died of wounds (DOW) due to delay of treatment.
<p>Performance includes, but is not limited to, the following services:</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop, implement, use and enhance expeditionary medical knowledge warehouse (EMedKW). Manage medical modeling and simulation data sets, monitor for data integrity, and perform statistical analysis of these data sets.  The contractor will maintain the data dictionaries and data specification documents.  The data elements in the warehouse will be accessible by a variety of program applications including casualty rate estimation, medical logistics, military operations risk assessment, forecasting and other medical planning software.  <br />&bull;	Develop, implement, use and enhance the Enterprise Estimating Supplies Program (EESP).  The contractor will maintain the data dictionaries, data specification documents and the web-based interface. <br />&bull;	Develop, implement, use and enhance JMPT and MPTk functionality.  This includes governing a Configuration Control Board (CCB) and maintaining an on-going database of desired enhancements.  Enhancements will include integrating JMPT and the ONR HIT model into Navy war-gaming environments (e.g. Navy Common Training Environment) and other planning and execution tools. These tools will be designed and accredited to function in both a local environment and across the Internet.  This would allow several people to exchange data, and share scenarios and reports.  Identify operationally relevant reporting metrics (e.g., ANNEX Q) and implement enhancements to the reporting feature of the tools.  Develop necessary documentation as described in MIL-STD 3022 (05 APR 2012) to support the continued accreditation of suites of planning tools.  Additional authorizations include DADMS (Department of Navy Application &amp; Database Management System) and NMCI (Navy Marine Corps Intranet) certification while complying with RMF (Risk Management Framework for DoD Information Technology) protocols.  <br />&bull;	Conduct studies, analyses, and reporting of military expeditionary medicine within the planning tool operating environments.  Recommend and implement planning tool enhancements necessary to modify JMPT functionality, data structures, user interfaces, output report content, and format.  Provide analytic and programming support for future operations in complex and distributed combat and Humanitarian Assistant/Disaster Response (HA/DR) environments anticipated for each of the individual services, COCOMS, at the joint OASD (HA) and Joint Staff level and other government departments such as State, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services.  Present papers at professional conferences and support collaborative efforts with other organizations as needed.  <br />&bull;	Develop necessary software architecture and framework.  Integrate the medical treatment modules into the larger campaign models including weapons effects and threat vulnerability models.  Develop database structures, monitor data integrity, maintain database, integrate a supply generation model, and develop understanding of afloat and ashore, ship and vehicle vulnerabilities to address patient injury and treatment.  Develop automated mechanisms for determining Injury/ICD-9/Injury Severity Score profiles for various operational scenarios from ship and ground vehicle structural model output and model weapons effects and medical resource requirements.  Design, implement, integrate and test an empirically based enhancements to the casualty outcome module (died of wounds algorithm) of JMPT and other planning tools as required.  <br />&bull;	Theater medical network optimization technologies.  Conduct directed research to examine, evaluate, design, and implement methods and technologies to optimize Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) and theater medical network design. <br />&bull;	Design and implement modular expeditionary medical facilities into JMPT.  This task will include data, schema, and software development. <br />&bull;	Develop training, outreach materials, and conduct training for the medical planner community of interest.  Provide demonstrations and medical planning tool training at both performers' facilities and at DoD customer sites in CONUS/OCONUS.  Develop and conduct training at the introductory and power-user levels to maximize medical planner ability to conduct risk assessments and medical course of action analyses effectively.  Provide entry-level medical planners the ability to visualize the theater support requirements and to learn how to create medical estimates and supportability within a defined theater of operations. <br />&bull;	Provide technical support including planning and course of analysis software to the global community of users.  Establish and maintain a help desk support system.  The system must provide monthly metrics that allow tracking of user incidents and resolutions.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA or Agency) is initiating the development of an Enterprise Automation Strategy.  The strategy will consider both NextGen requirements and end-of-life considerations to recommend a timeframe for replacement of NAS automation platforms.  While the Agency is initiating activities to define program and system requirements for a replacement system or group of systems it is imperative to sustain and enhance present systems. 

To acquire, field, and operationalize these systems could take from 10-15 years, especially considering both the complexity of the systems themselves and the complexity of replacing them.  As part of this overall effort, the Agency has a requirement for the continued system integration, sustainment, and enhancement of Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) during the 10-15 year period.

STARS is used by air traffic control specialists (ATCS) to perform terminal radar air traffic control functions as defined in FAA Handbook 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.  The general roles and responsibilities of ATC personnel have remained unchanged with the deployment of STARS.  STARS is used to support both primary and secondary radar target identification, maintenance of target identity, radar separation, traffic and weather advisory services, and navigational assistance to participating aircraft.  STARS also provides full ATC operational functionality identical to that of the TRACON in all tower cabs.

STARS provides the coordination and data display functions required by both TRACON and tower ATC personnel.  STARS is used to effect both inter- and intra-facility radar handoffs and include Flight Data Input/Output (FDIO) functions in the existing ARTS baseline.  STARS data display includes aircraft positional data, aircraft status, flight plan information, and general information.  STARS continues to provide safety functions such as the Conflict Alert (CA), Mode-C intruder (MCI), and Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW).  STARS also supports controller and maintenance training. Supervisory and traffic management specialists use STARS for operational oversight to support real-time air traffic control decision-making.  STARS has had a positive impact on existing operational procedures, for example, STARS provides emergency service safeguarding ATC operations in the event of a failure.  Emergency service provides the controller with surveillance position information, sensor identification, aircraft beacon code, filters, altitude, maps, range marks, and weather information.  Additionally, multi-sensor tracking provides expanded and redundant radar coverage thereby reducing the need for Center Radar ARTS Presentation (CENRAP) and non-radar operations.

This market survey is issued in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.1.2.1 to obtain information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to conduct a full and open competition for the continued system integration, sustainment, and enhancement of STARS. This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. 

The current STARS contract DTFA01-96-D-03008 was competitively awarded on September 16, 1996 for the purpose of standardizing multiple terminal air traffic control automation platforms in the National Air Space System (NAS).  These terminal automation Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS) and Common Automated Terminal Systems (CARTS) legacy systems were located at Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities, Air Traffic Control Towers, and Department of Defense (DoD) Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) facilities.  After the contract ends on September 30, 2021, the FAA will have replaced all the legacy systems as well as have completed the first phase of STARS Sustainment 2 (SS2).

The STARS platform includes the following Raytheon proprietary software: (1) AutoTrac software, required to integrate radar and flight plan data and display accurate information to air traffic controllers for the Full Service Level for STARS; and (2) ATCoach, a multi-purpose, real-time Air Traffic Control Simulator system that supports the generation of data needed to supply automation systems with surveillance, weather, and flight data for STARS training and test simulation.  

The STARS platform also uses third party vendor processes and tools for development and deployment activities, most of which are obtained from Raytheon. These third party tools and associated Raytheon-developed products include:  ClearCase, Oracle, Ceptral (software tool), Teleuse, Totalview (debug tool), DDTS  Distributed Defect Tracking System, OSF Tools (These tools are critical to the OSF adaptation specialists), Flash archives, and IDT - Installation Data Tapes (IDT).  

The STARS Platform also requires Raytheon documentation to effectively manage the STARS software including: 1) Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) - The SRS documents ( one for each CSCI) are the software-level requirements as decomposed from the SSS documents by the systems engineer, mapping each SSS-level requirement to one or more SRS requirements, which may be spread across documents/computer software configuration items (CSCIs), 2) Software Design Documents (SDD) - The SDD is the document where the software development team documents the design to implement the corresponding software requirements assigned to a CSCI.  

Again, as with the SRSs, there will be multiple SDD documents  one per CSCI, 3) Interface Control Documents/Interface Design Documents (ICD/IDD) - The ICD/IDD documents specify the details of messages exchanged within the STARS system, either between hardware and software or between software elements.  Generally, this will include message formats, field definitions, message frequency, originator/recipient of messages, etc., 4) User Documentation - This includes all user manual documents; for example, Terminal Controller Workstation/Tower Display Workstation (TCW/TDW) manuals (for controllers), Maintenance Control Workstation (MCW) manuals (Tech Ops), security administration manuals, Database Management System (DMS) manuals (for OSF personnel), etc.  These form the basis for the Technical Instruction (TI) manuals and Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) issued by TLSE to support field sites and used by the training organization for Air Traffic and Tech Ops training, and 5) assembly manuals and system drawings.  

Data rights to Raytheons proprietary software will be required to sustain and enhance STARS, as all software planned for product improvements in STARS Sustainment 3 (SS3) and STARS Sustainment Portfolio 1 (SSP1) will be integrated and deployed with Raytheons proprietary software.  All software is critical to the operations of the deployed system.

If any vendor believes they have the capability and data rights necessary to satisfy this requirement, please submit a Capability Statement that clearly states how they will be able to meet these requirements to the STARS Contracting Officer, Peter DeWald at peter.dewald@faa.gov no later than 5:00 PM, September 14, 2018.  Any such response must include details regarding access to all the necessary data rights and documentation cited above or alternative solutions. 

This announcement is for notification purposes only and is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

<DESC>1. The US Forest Service, Region 1 - Northern Region has a requirement for Architect/Engineering services, indefinite quantity indefinite delivery contracts for Materials Testing and Geotechnical Services for the National Grasslands and Forests in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and North Idaho. Architect/Engineering firms which meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit: <br />(1) a SF 330 Part II, General Qualifications, (2) a SF 330 Part 1, Contract Specific Qualifications and (3) any requested supplemental data to the procurement office shown below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 with a size standard of $15 million. Following an initial evaluation of the qualifications and performance data submitted, one or more firms considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required, will be chosen for negotiation. Multiple firms may be selected from this announcement. Selection of firms for negotiation shall be through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required that include (1) Professional qualifications; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) Location in the general geographical area; (4) Capacity; (5) Past performance. The projects performed under this contract will primarily focus on professional services to provide Geotechnical, Pavement and Materials engineering and associated Materials Testing services predominately to the Northern Region (Region One). The work involves engineering services related to low-volume roads, tunnels, dams, and facility design and construction in Region One of the US Forest Service. Required services are primarily in the areas of asphalt, chip seals, concrete, aggregate surface, and aggregate stabilized pavements; construction materials testing and inspections on all types of roads and facilities; inspections, investigation, analysis and design for pavements, small (earthen) dams, hydraulic structures, landslides, retaining structures, foundations, and rock sources. Only firms with Registered Professional Engineers licensed in one of the States of Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota with eligibility for reciprocity in one or more of the other states will be considered for award of the contract. The Contractor's associated laboratory must be nationally accredited by AASHTO or equivalent in Asphalt, Concrete and Aggregate Testing. The Government may elect to award a single or multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts for the same or similar services to one or more sources for professional road (pavement) Construction Materials Testing, construction monitoring, and geotechnical services for the Region. The contracts will be issued as a one-year base contract with four one-year options (potential of five years). However, the Government reserves the right to award only one contract for the combined areas. Task orders will be issued as needed to accomplish the work. Contract time will vary with each individual task order. The Architect-Engineering firm must demonstrate its, and each key subcontractor's, qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all services. Contractor qualifications will be assessed using the criteria outlined below. Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance to the Government. Specific evaluation factors include: 1. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services: Offeror will address criteria in SF 330. Professional qualifications of great importance to the Government include licensing of skills applicable to this work in the state(s) services will be performed and experience in the type of services required. Specifically small dams, secondary/low traffic roads, and aggregate surfaced roads is more valuable than experience provided on interstate highways or large water barriers (dikes, levees, or dams). Of less value is an offeror with minimum number of qualified personnel on the team; or team that does not have a history of working together. 2. Specialized experienced and technical competence in the type of work required: Offeror will address in SF 330. Specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities of great importance to the Government include experience and expertise in low-volume asphalt and chipseal pavements; small dams; hydraulic structures; landslides; retaining structures; foundations; rock sources; aggregate and stabilized aggregate surfaced roads; and secondary roads such as parks, camp grounds, small developments, etc. Offerors demonstrating experience only in major highways, large bridges, major water barriers, on flat terrain will not have the same understanding of the required design considerations and associated problems typical of the small/lower volume facilities on steep Forest lands and therefore will be rated lower. 3. Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project. Offeror is required to demonstrate an understanding of hazards when traveling on Forest roads to project sites; an understanding of the types of remote areas project sites may be located; unique and varied geological features found in the Northern Region. The variety of unique and complex geological features common to the North West and Northern Mid-West areas of Region 1, include all types of bedrock structure, with random and frequent structural discontinuities, overlain frequently with glacial deposits. The more familiar a team is with these unique geologic features and the associated common design and construction problems, the more effective and efficient they will be designing solutions and solving problems. As a result, teams with project experience in this or similar geologic regimes will be given a higher rating; offerors less familiar will be rated lower; offerors that have no experience working in such geology will be rated unsatisfactory. Offerors familiar with working in remote areas subject to limited communication, changing weather conditions, exposure to dangerous or aggressive wildlife will be rated higher than those that have worked in urban environments and mild climates. Offerors will also frequently be required to deliver and pick up samples and conduct specialized tests at the Regional Forest Service Materials Laboratory in Missoula, Montana. 4. Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time: Offeror is to provide information regarding team ability and capacity to perform multiple tasks over a broad area in a short construction season. Offerors demonstrating the ability to efficiently mobilize and respond to a broad variety of services located on multiple Forests will be rated higher than those having to travel considerable distances or have limited resources for field investigation and inspection portion of these services. Offerors may be required to provide services in a very short turnaround to meet construction acquisition deadlines. 5. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Offerors record of satisfactory performance in providing similar services to Federal and State land management agencies in the North Western part of the US during the past 3 years.

<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure transportation services for the NCI Director and other high-level staff members. The NCI Immediate Office of the Director owns a vehicle that is</p>
<p><br />specifically assigned and reserved for this purpose and needs a contracted driver to be available as necessary. The driver will need to be on-site and be available as described in the Scope below</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (October 2014)</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:</p>
<p>Selection of an offeror for award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against five factors. The factors, in order of importance are: Technical Approach, Experience, Expertise of Staff, 4. Past Performance, and 5. Price. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost/price. The process described in FAR 15.101-1 may be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors to consider award to other than the lowest price offer or other than the highest technically rated factor. The Government intends to make an award to the offeror whose proposals provide the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs set forth in the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors listed below.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Process:</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this quotation to the responsible Contractor whose quote conforming to the quotation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<p>&bull; A list of three (3) contracts providing similar services for quantitation of circulating inflammation markers currently in process that are similar in nature to the solicitation. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial concerns.<br />Include the following information for each contract or subcontract:</p>

Total Contract Value<br />5. Description of Requirement<br />6. Contracting Officer's Name and Telephone Number<br />7. Program Manager's Name and Telephone Number</p>
<p>Each quoter/offeror may be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. The Government is not required to contact all references provided by the quoter/offeror. Also, references other than those identified by the quoter/offeror may be contacted by the Government to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation of the quoter/offeror's organizational experience.</p>
<p>The Government may evaluate the offeror's past performance on organizational experience based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance on organizational experience information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.</p>
<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>Additional Submission Instructions</p>
<p>The quote must be prepared in two SEPARATE volumes: Volume I - "Technical Volume" and Volume II - "Price/Business Volume". Each of these parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that the evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of the evaluation of the other. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number should be included on the front cover of each volume.</p>
<p>Your quote must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ and signed by an official authorized to bind your organization. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt thereof by the Government.</p>
<p>This RFQ does not commit the Government to pay any of the costs associated with the preparation and submission of your quote. In addition, the Contracting Officer is the only individual authorized to legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this requirement. By submitting a quote in response to this solicitation, it is understood that your quote shall become a part of the official contract file.</p>
<p>Questions<br />Questions relating to this acquisition shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, William Neal, via email at william.neal@nih.gov no later than 3:00 PM EST on August 21, 2018.

<p>Evaluation and award will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of FAR 13.106. The Government does not anticipate requesting revisions to quotes, so Quoters should provide their best solution and price in response to the Solicitation. However, the Government reserves the right to request quote revisions that seek additional price discounts, provide revisions to the technical quote, or clarify aspects of the quote. In the event quote revisions are requested, the Government will not necessarily be seeking revisions from all Quoters.</p>
<p>The technical volume must not contain references to price; however, resource information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, etc., must be contained in the technical volume so that the Respondent's understanding of the scope of work may be evaluated. Quoters must provide clear responses, including objectives and outcomes, to each task addressing the work to be performed in the SOW. The technical volume must reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work being undertaken. Quotes which merely offer to conduct a project in accordance with the Government's requirements will not be eligible for award.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Quoter's price for all items/services proposed. Quotations will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition.</p>

<CONTACT>Swee L. Teo, Contracting Officer, Phone 240-669-5173, Email teosl@niaid.nih.gov - Gayle Sunde, Contracting Officer, Phone 240-669-5167, Email gayle.sunde@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent, not a request for quotations. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competition basis with Qiagen to procure 310 kits of HotstarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase (1000) that will be used at the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) during a period of 18 months from date of award.
<p><br />Human lymphocytes involved in maintenance of and immune responses against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other infectious illnesses will be characterized in extensive detail by polymerase chain reaction assays and the unique pathogen receptors they express. These investigations help define how key immune cells are expanded and thus contribute to the pathogenesis and the immunologic control of these important infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The HotstarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase is a high-sensitivity thermal cycling RNA polymerase that is used in a novel assay VRC has developed and used to detect and sequence B cell receptor DNA from cells of infected individuals. It has been thoroughly tested and proven to amplify DNA from single cell sources in VRC custom assay. Other products were unable to reliably produce high quality results in this format. This is essential to the trial VRC plan to use it for. These high-quality results from extremely low initial levels of nucleic acid are necessary, because failure will result in the loss of highly precious materials from this clinical trial. Moreover, it is compatible with downstream PCR reactions, an important factor in determining the trial success. This reagent is also being used by VRC's collaborative site and must be identical to allow cross site comparisons. Any deviation in the formulation of these reactions will confound the results and reduce the power of the data below statistical levels of any value. This product has been shown to yield required results where others have failed. Key specifications are as follows:<br />&bull; Processivity sufficient for amplification of single cell level transcript<br />&bull; Compatible with other components of the assay <br />&bull; Efficiency level appropriate for up and down stream processing</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supply or service will satisfy agency requirements. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES. All responsible sources that could provide comparable services may submit a capability statement that will be considered by email (subject line to reference NIAID-NOI18-1923199) to Swee L. Teo at teosl@niaid.nih.gov by 3:00pm EST, Tuesday, September 4, 2018. All responses received by the closing date of this Notice will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<CONTACT>MADSEN, HEATHER
<DESC>NPS SERVICEWIDE APP: TECHNICAL CONSULTATION

As mobile technology improved, apps became a viable way to supplement functionality provided by NPS.gov for park visitorsparticularly those who may be in remote locations and lack Internet connectivity. Because creating an app can be expensive and poses technical, usability, and accessibility risks that individual parks were not prepared to negotiate, Harpers Ferry Center (HFC), the NPS center for interpretive media, began experimenting in order to assist parks. Their first apps lead to some consensus on what functionality should be consistently provided, and an app framework was developed. 

Currently, there are 16 individual park apps available through Google Play and 19 through iTunes. Usage statistics for these apps are tracked through Google Analytics.

Several factors combine to make now the time to evaluate the current app options provided to parks and design a servicewide app that provides baseline functionality for national-level functionality and parks as well as the ability for individual parks to create custom park-specific features in collaboration with HFC.

The contractor shall provide technical consultation services to assist the Digital Strategy Division to work with its stakeholders to develop a technical design and implementation plan for a servicewide app with national and modular park-specific content for the National Park Service. 

This RFP is reserved for Small Business Concerns under NAICS Code 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services. Only small business may respond. 

All responses must be received by the closing date of this publication in order to be considered by the Government.

In preparation of your proposal, please be advised that the resulting contract shall be Fixed Price.

The period of performance September 28, 2018 through March 31, 2019.

The current PORTS program is based on the use of a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) simulation engine called the Combined Tactical Training and Analysis System (CTTAS).
 CTTAS provides an instructor station and manages the simulation for each specific trainer being developed.  The PORTS/CTTAS architecture forms the core of a family of trainer simulations.  The program is intended to meet immediate and future training needs for the Surface Navy.  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) has ownership of and licensing rights to the CTTAS software. Program requirements are currently being fulfilled utilizing the 2011 PORTS ID/IQC (Contract Number N61340-11-D-0005). The incumbent is Northrop Grumman.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) C4ISR Department (Code 31) is seeking information on approaches for the development of compact electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) countermeasure (CM) payloads to support a potential Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program.  It is envisioned that the compact payload will have components including visible and infrared transceivers, an optical train for beam control, control electronics, processor and an inertial navigation system (INS).  For demonstration purposes, two versions of the payload will be considered.  Each of these payloads may be carried on a larger platform initially for measurements, debugging and development purposes.  However, they will eventually be integrated and demonstrated on moving systems with stringent size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements in 2022.  Finally, each payload should be able to reach a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 (for TRL definition, see https://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/404585.pdf) in fiscal year (FY) 2023.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
<p>INTRODUCTION: This Sources Sought Synopsis is for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online Subscriptions to include SharePoint integration, Microsoft PowerBI integration, with hosting environment in Government Community Cloud. The information received will be used within the Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center - Fort Sam Houston (MICC Center -FSH) to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the organization.<br /><br />This announcement is for planning and informational purposes only and SHALL NOT be considered an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Request for Proposal (RFP). There is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this Sources Sought Synopsis. This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis or reimburse respondents for information solicited and provided. No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.<br /><br />BACKGROUND: The MICC Center - FSH has a requirement in support of the Office of the Chief of Chaplains for Microsoft Dynamics 365 online subscriptions. The current requirement is being fulfilled through the GSA Federal Supply Schedule. The Contractor shall provide Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online Subscriptions to include SharePoint integration, Microsoft PowerBI integration, with hosting environment in Government Community Cloud.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the acquisition is 511210, Software Publishing with a corresponding small business size standard of $38.5M. The FSC for this acquisition is 7030-Information Technology Software. In your opinion, does this NAICS code fit this requirement? If not, which NAICS code would you suggest and why?</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT: To request information on capabilities of potential offerors to provide Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online Subscriptions to include SharePoint integration, Microsoft PowerBI integration, with hosting environment in Government Community Cloud. The government intends to award a contract for the requirement on a sole source GSA basis, but is seeking vendors that may be able to provide this requirement in order to support a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>A decision to set-aside this requirement for a small business program or to compete it through full and open procedures has not yet been made.</p>
<p>RESPONSES REGARDING POTENTIAL SOURCES STATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES: Interested Offerors having the required specialized capabilities / qualifications to support some or all of the work identified in the PWS are asked to answer the following questions and submit a capability statement. Capability statements shall contain the following information:<br />1. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.<br />2. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.<br />3. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.<br />4. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.<br />5. Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition. Please contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-3015, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the FedBizOpps notice. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.<br />YOUR RESPONSE TO THE SYNOPSIS: The Government requests separate files for Statement of Capabilities; submitted electronically in PDF format. Offeror's responses shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages single-sided - standard 8 &frac12; X 11 pages using not less than 10-pitch font -- and shall describe the offerors technical expertise in sufficient detail to make an informed determination of the offerors ability to successfully perform the services described in the Draft PWS.<br />All responses to include (1) the Statement of Capabilities and (2) Response shall be received no later than 29 August 2018 at 12:00 PM CDT. Please respond via electronic mail (e-mail) to the Contracting Officer, Sam Colton, at the following address: Samuel.J.Colton.civ@mail.mil and Contract Specialist, Andrew Graham, at the following address: andrew.s.graham6.mil@mail.mil. All questions MUST be in writing and should also be directed to Sam Colton and Andrew Graham. In all responses, please reference 11211795 Microsoft Dynamics in the subject line. Verbal questions will not be accepted. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. No telephonic responses will be accepted. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in Federal Business Opportunities. The requirement will be a GSA award if no vendors are found via FBO. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.<br />Primary Point of Contact: Andrew Graham<br />Contract Specialist<br />Email: andrew.s.graham6.mil@mail.mil<br />Secondary Point of Contact: Sam Colton <br />Contracting Officer<br />Email: Samuel.J.Colton.civ@mail.mil<br />Contracting Office Address:<br />2205 Infantry Post Road, Bldg. 603 Fort Sam Houston, Texas 78234-1361 United States</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />W911SD-18-P-0063 <br />HAZMAT RESPONSE<br />THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government currently intends to award a contract for a Hazmat Response to render safe an M-47 Bomb that was leaking a toxic chemical on an SOLE SOURCE basis, but is seeking vendors that may be able to perform this requirement in order to support a competitive procurement. Accordingly, the U.S. Government highly encourages all interested businesses (large and small) to respond to this sources sought synopsis. In addition, small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), must describe their identifying capabilities in meeting the requirements at a fair market price, i.e., information which may help support a set-aside.
<p>The proposed sole source Firm Fixed Price contract to Miller Environmental Group Inc. <br />for a hazmat response. The USMA had an inert M-47 bomb that was emitting bromonicotinic acid. The authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The requirement is to render the bomb safe for further deposition.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The NAICS code(s) is/are: 562910 Remediation Services, 750 employees (note 14).</p>

<CONTACT>Jones, Ashton
<DESC>Sources Sought and Industry Day Notification
Scope:
NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.
The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, and to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive.
The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 237990 which has a corresponding Size standard of $36.5M annual average revenue. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement.
Projected Requirement Details: 
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), a water management agency within the Department of the Interior desires to engage the water treatment industry to provide a clear, concise, fair, and reasonable approach to the procurement strategy regarding the design and construction of the San Juan Lateral Water Treatment Plant (SJLWTP).
The SJLWTP is part of the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project (NGWSP), whose overarching mission is to convey a reliable municipal and industrial water supply from the San Juan River to the eastern section of the Navajo Nation, southwestern portion of the Jicarilla Apache Nation, and the city of Gallup, New Mexico via about 300 miles of pipeline, several pumping plants, and two water treatment plants. BOR seeks to further its mission for the NGWSP through a traditional (firm-fixed) design-build procurement strategy of the SJLWTP in conformance with the two-step process identified in Federal Acquisitions Regulations, Subpart 36.3  Two Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures. Phase One will be a merit/qualifications-based selection, while Phase Two will focus primarily on cost and technical approach (see attached draft Sections L and M for Phase One and Phase Two evaluation criteria) based on an approximate 30% design level with the Phase Two Proposal. 
The SJLWTP design-build contract incorporates an initial 22.0 million gallons per day (MGD) water treatment plant, expandable in the future to 37.6 MGD, with six months of operations and maintenance included in the proposed initial award. The SJLWTP will receive pretreated surface water from the San Juan River via Reaches 1  3 (designed by BOR and constructed by others) and will deliver treated water to the Reach 4a transmission pipeline (designed by BOR and constructed by others) serving multiple entities.  The SJLWTP project scope will involve the design and construction for the work within the plant yard for which no design has yet been performed.  
Strategy Overview/Schedule of Projected Events:

Request for Information  Procurement Strategy
Information/Input Requested:
BASED ON THE RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE/MARKET RESEARCH, THIS REQUIREMENT MAY BE SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES OR PROCURED THROUGH FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.
Submission Instructions for RFI Questions Listed Below: Interested parties who consider themselves competent to perform the above-listed qualification and/or production are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by October 5, 2018.  All responses to this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to Ms. Amy Loveless, Contract Specialist, aloveless@usbr.gov, and carbon copy (CC) Mr. Ashton Jones, Contracting Officer, at ajones@usbr.gov.   
Responses are requested but not required. No award will be made off the responses provided as this is not a solicitation notice. The provided information may or may not affect the projected acquisition strategy. If providing information please keep the responses short, concise, and to the point. Only provide expanded information if the providing entity finds the information valuable. Lengthy, verbose responses are not required or desired. Please limit the total response to no more than 5 pages. 
If you have technical questions concerning this opportunity please contact: Bart Deming, USBR Four Corners Construction Office (FCCO), bdeming@usbr.gov. 
Regarding Bid Phase One  Request for Qualifications (RFQ):
1)	The RFQ bid phase will be merit based.  What factors would distinguish bidders beyond some of the obvious such as past performance, water treatment experience, design-build experience, team experience, and cost controls proposed in section L?
2)	What are some project risks you can foresee?  
3)	The anticipated project schedule is based on an award in September 2019 and substantial completion in March 2024 when delivery of drinking water to downstream distribution systems would begin.  Reclamation has planned that completion date, based on having the downstream transmission system completed and ready to deliver drinking water before this date.  Given the project scope, please provide your opinion on this duration for designing, constructing, and commissioning this WTP.  Would there be advantages to having a shorter schedule?
4)	How would you feel about Reclamation offering a Fixed price incentive and cost share with meeting an accelerated completion date?  Note that if there is value in allowing for an accelerated completion timeframe, Reclamation would likely delay the solicitation to coincide with a completion date in March 2024.
5)	As currently shown in the pre-solicitation documents, Reclamation is acquiring 100 acres for this project, including to provide for sufficient staging areas and future expansion, including space for approx. 3-days of raw water storage at full-build out.  Is there an advantage to having more land available?
Regarding Bid Phase Two  Request for Proposals:
6)	Assuming a traditional design-build procurement (firm-fixed price at contract award), what level of RFP design development in percent will ensure that scope of work can be clearly articulated, project risk understood, and project risk mitigation identified?
7)	What level of contingency or risk would you assume at your recommended bid phase design development in percent?
8)	Reclamation is considering opportunities for bidders to check-in during the RFP design development and ask if the proposal development is consistent with overall conformance and meets the intent of the Technical Criteria Package. Would you take advantage of this opportunity?
9)	At what stages of bid phase design development would you like to check-in; 10%, 15%, etc assuming a 30% design development?  What coordination and response would you expect from Reclamation staff when you check-in?
10)	The meetings during Phase Two with the Government could both be inclusive with all short-listed firms to have discussions, as well as proprietary one-on-one meetings.  Do you have a preference in one type of meeting or the other?  If so, please state your reasons.
11)	Given the projects evaluation criteria included in sections L and M of the pre-solicitation and that an overall budget range will be provided, how would you approach maximizing best value?
12)	Describe your confidence in performing a life-cycle cost analysis during the RFP - Bid Phase Two.  It should be assumed that items such as discount rate, interest rate, cost of chemicals, cost of utilities, etc. will be defined.  What factors would you include?
13)	To ensure fair competition between offerors, what life-cycle cost elements should be defined by the owner?
14)	Reclamation has currently allocated 110 calendar days in the procurement schedule for Bid Phase Two  RFP.  How many days would you expect to need to develop a design sufficient to enter into a firm-fixed price contract during the RFP phase?
15)	Reclamation is planning on offering a stipend to the two not-selected shortlisted firms from Phase Two.  What are typical proposal development costs for projects of similar magnitude and scope to this with RFP phase designs developed to 30%?  What do you believe is a fair stipend amount given the scope of this project?
After the Bid Phase:
16)	What type of design involvement do you anticipate having with the owner after contract award?
17)	How would you ensure construction staff from your team are involved in the design phase?  Via constructability reviews?  At what design stages?

<DESC>Statement of Work (SOW)
Vivarium Management System

Background: The Ralph H. Johnson Research Service Veterinary Medical Unit (VMU) requires a vivarium management system to electronically organize and manage daily operations, monthly billing, and annual reporting that will fulfill VA (local SOP 19), federal regulatory (The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals), and animal research accreditation requirements (AAALAC International). 

Objectives: Our objectives are to provide uninterrupted continuity of service to maintain our current high quality of research and standards of performance for successful daily management of a vivarium. 

Scope: This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for the Charleston VAMC Research Service Line to procure vivarium management services that will be the primary mode of managing animal operations in our vivarium, tracking health history and veterinary care, and communicating about animal status with researchers and staff. We have extensively customized the system for the needs of our agency and facility over the past 5 years, so its utility includes facilitating annual reports to regulatory agencies and the Chief VA Veterinary Medical Officer, tracking animal use for the Institutional Care and Use Committee (IACUC), managing animal breeding and genotyping activities, and alerting investigators to new health events. The requested product and support services provide the foundation for all operations in the VMU, such as printing cage cards for animals and recording animal census. The vivarium management system includes a broad range of capabilities from storing animal genotyping data, mating, litters produced, health records, birth, death, weaning, weaning efficiency, longevity, and messaging amongst animal care staff or veterinary staff and researchers about daily observations, animal treatments, and illnesses.  Researchers can access data using secure, unique user names and passwords through an internet interface, allowing convenient access to the system at any time. Operational efficiencies and animal per diem billing accuracy are achieved through use of this product, facilitating the research of approximately 30 animal investigators holding ~$6 million in VA-funded animal research.

Tasks (As applicable): The contractor shall provide subscription to the vivarium management system in 15 units of 250 active animal records, for a total of 3750. Needs will be reassessed annually based on animal census in the vivarium. The contractor shall provide up to 5 hours of remote support services. 
 
Training (As applicable): Vendor to provide training on site and support service as necessary.

Place of Performance or Delivery Address: Ralph H. Johnson VAMC Research Service 30 Courtenay Dr., STB-702 Charleston, SC  29425

Period of Performance: Base Year and 4 one-year Option Periods

<a href="mailto:connie.p.arline@faa.gov">Click here to email Connie Arline</a>
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THIS IS A DRAFT SIR RELEASE FOR THE UPCOMING OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS AND REPORTING SYSTEM (OARS) PROCUREMENT.  

Industry participation while encouraged is strictly voluntary.  Failure to provide a response will not prevent a vendor from submitting a formal response to the FAAs release of a future SIR.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing a response to the Draft SIR.   

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is releasing a draft SIR package for the Operational Analysis and Reporting System (OARS) to solicit feedback on the SIR contents and obtain responses to specific questions from industry regarding key aspects of the acquisition approach.  Please use the OARS SIR Comment Matrix provided to provide comments on the OARS draft SIR package.  
 
The Operational Analysis and Reporting System (OARS) program will address shortfalls by consolidating disparate legacy safety systems (i.e., applications, software, and databases) into a single safety data/information access portal. The OARS program will establish an enterprise portal, which will provide a single access point to data and applications for safety analysis to support the FAAs system safety management. In addition, the OARS program will seek to achieve the following objectives:
 
	Improving data collection and analysis with near real time safety information (hazards, mitigations, performance monitoring, etc.) for users to effectively analyze large amounts of data associated with safety events in the NAS (e.g., potential losses of separation)
	Delivering a suite of FAA analytics and a user interface that will improve the efficiency of safety analysis and provide the framework for integrating future NextGen technologies into the NAS
	Integrating existing functionality, eliminating database redundancy, improving
Life cycle maintenance, improving data management, and providing a flexible platform to implement emerging technologies and services
 
The Draft SIR consists of sections B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (all exhibits attached) K, L, and M.

The FAA is looking for comments or feedback on all SIR Sections.  

	Are there any requirements which are vague or unclear? 
	Does the proposed pricing structure and contract types identified in Section B provide sufficient flexibility for you to price your solution?
	Do the requirements defined in Section C provide sufficient flexibility for a DevOps development methodology to be followed?
	Is the cost incentive fee and cost share ratio identified in Section B and Section H adequate to incentivize performance?
	Are the data rights clauses identified in Section I appropriate for your solution?
	Does the information provided in the J-attachments provide sufficient information for you to develop a comprehensive solution for OARS?
	Are there aspects of the SIR that you believe will hinder competition?  
The evaluation process for Past Performance is still being developed and is not included in Section M.  The Cost Model referenced in Section M is not included in the draft SIR.
 
The FAA does not intend to publish responses to these questions or other feedback on the draft SIR received from interested parties.  Notwithstanding, the responses and feedback will be considered by the FAA in the development of the final SIR.  If follow-up questions or general questions regarding the OARS procurement are submitted, the FAA may publish responses if deemed beneficial to all prospective offerors.  If so, the questions will be included without attribution to the identity of the submitter.  The FAA reserves the right now to provide responses to questions that are potentially offeror-specific.

<p>SUBMITTALS SHOULD BE MADE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT<br />2.	Potential Sources Sought. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD) is conducting market survey to identify potential sources for an anticipated contract award. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information, for planning purposes, to determine the availability and capability of qualified sources to perform the project work.</p>
<p>This notice does not solicit proposals. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>Pursuant to 48 C.F.R. Part 10, the Government is conducting market research to:</p>
<p>&bull;	Determine what sources exist that are capable of satisfying the Government's requirements listed below,<br />&bull;	Determine the capabilities of potential contractors,<br />&bull;	Determine the size and status of potential sources, and<br />&bull;	Determine the level of competition (i.e. 8(a), set-aside, or full and open).</p>
<p>3.	INTRODUCTION - Statement of Need</p>
<p>In June 2016, the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest endured a 1,000-year rain event. Numerous roads and bridges throughout the Forest were damaged, rendering several roads closed.  The intent of this project is to repair several roadway sections within the Forest, with an emphasis on bridge replacement and bridge repair.  The cost of the entire project is expected to fall within the price range of $1,000,000.00 to $2,000,000.00.</p>
<p>4.	DESCRIPTION OF WORK</p>
<p>&bull;	Site B1 - Remove existing road bridge and replace with 24' wide by 60' long timber bridge.  Reconstruct and pave 100' of roadway at each approach.<br />&bull;	Site B3 - Remove existing road bridge and replace with 24' wide by 70' long timber bridge.  Reconstruct and pave 100' of roadway at each approach.<br />&bull;	Site B5 - Encapsulate existing abutment piles with concrete, approximately 75 CY.<br />&bull;	Site B6 - Place rip rap adjacent to existing bridge abutments and wingwalls.<br />&bull;	Site S12 - Construction 80' long by 24' wide new road bridge.  Reconstruct 50' of roadway approaches on each side.<br />&bull;	Install 15'-20' span bottomless prefabricated concrete arch culvert.  <br />&bull;	Trail bridges (multiple sites) - Replace approximately 4 damaged trail bridges with proposed lengths ranging from 20' to 50' and proposed widths of approximately 6'.  Work on the trail bridges is in a remote location (generally several thousand feet from the nearest roadway) only accessible with small equipment such as skid steers, mini excavators, and mechanical wheelbarrows due to the narrow width of the trail.  Reconstruct trail bridge approaches as appropriate.<br />&bull;	Replace damaged / install new approximately 2 arch culverts, ranging in span from approximately 3' to 5'.<br />&bull;	Other miscellaneous work in various locations in the Forest, including aggregate resurfacing, ditch repair, and placement and maintenance of erosion and sediment control and maintenance of traffic devices.</p>
<p>Key Restrictions</p>
<p>&bull;	Work will not be permitted on holidays. <br />&bull;	Work will generally be permitted on nights and weekends.  <br />&bull;	Certain sites may not be accessible until other sites (on this project or others) are completed.  <br />&bull;	Utility relocations are anticipated.  Work schedule will need to be coordinated with utility companies.<br />&bull;	When accessing the trail bridges, the contractor will be required to minimize tree clearing and disturbance.  This will likely require the use of only small equipment.  <br />&bull;	The Government anticipates placing maximum time limits on several bridge replacement sites.</p>
<p>Schedule</p>
<p>&bull;	The estimated NTP for this project is 3/15/19.  Note that this date is an estimate only and is subject to change.  Weather in the area doesn't normally allow construction activities until May, and there is a 2-4 week heavy load restriction in place after the snow melts.  Work in trout streams will not be permitted until late May and work in warm water streams will not be permitted until late June.<br />&bull;	The estimated fixed completion date for this project is 11/15/19.

<DESC>One of the most significant challenges in dealing with emerging pests is the difficulty in treating remote or difficult to access populations, or populations adjacent to sensitive areas or water, which cannot be managed adequately with conventional application technology. Recent advances in Remotely Piloted Systems (RPS) offer significant improvement in the precision placement of pesticide applications which may be unsuitable for treatment through conventional aerial or ground based application, and may offer significant improvements in program efficiency related to treatment efficacy, cost, and applicator safety. <br />Current methodologies may result in excessive costs, or present unacceptable risks to the applicator and the environment due to pesticide drift. By utilizing RPS mounted systems, we may reduce application risk, cost, and improve efficacy while reducing pesticide drift by having an application platform within a much closer proximity to the canopy and pest species allowing much more precise application.<br />All state and federal regulations will be followed. The contractor will be required to have a FAA Part 137 Certificate and 333 exemption. This work will take place in Montana and or Idaho and the contractor will be required to be licensed to perform UAS pesticide application in these states. <br />

<DESC>Mechanical/Electrical Design Sources Sought
<p>THIS IS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of Small Businesses (e.g., 8(a), Service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, Small disadvantaged business, Veteran-owned small business, and Women-owned small business) under NAICS code, 541330, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge to provide architectural design services:<br />The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) is a Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) facility with 52 buildings located on (578-acre) site in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The NIST site has approximately 3,424,353 gross square feet (GSF) of floor space including R&amp;D, office, and service areas. The majorities of the building are brick exterior in construction and are approximately 50 - 60 years old. NIST is seeking information on qualified Small Businesses for an IDIQ A/E Design contract that can provide Architecture and Engineering Services  under NAICS Code 541330 with specialized experience in following types of projects: <br />In general, A/E services performed for NIST generally include evaluation, renovation, modification, replacement, and upgrading of mechanical systems, electrical systems, and scientific research labs. The work includes field investigation, surveying, and document preparation. Document preparation includes engineering feasibility studies, conceptual designs and reports, contract drawings and specifications, design calculations, cost estimates, and project schedules as defined within the Statement of Work. <br />Specialized qualifications include experience in the evaluation and refurbishment of central plant chilled water systems, building mechanical and medium and low voltage electrical systems especially in terms of a campus type facility or similar large-scale facility.<br />Renovations of a central utility plant traditionally involves water based cooling towers, servicing multiple buildings physically separated with each building consuming at least 200 tons. In addition, experience with a central plant (gas or fuel oil) that utilizes steam boiler(s) that has a minimum capacity of 50,000 lbs./hr. to multiple interconnected buildings. <br />The Steam and Chilled Water Generation Plant (S&amp;CWGP), Building 302, produces steam, chilled water, and compressed air for the entire campus. Services are distributed throughout the NIST site through an underground network of piping systems. The Steam and Chilled Water Generation Plant also serves as a monitoring point for equipment alarms throughout the NIST site.<br />Steam is produced at 150 psi by up to six steam generators located in the Steam and Chilled Water Generation Plant (four (4) nameplate-rated at 44,000 lbs./hr. and two (2) rated at 80,000 lbs./hr.). There are four (4) Union Iron Works boilers at 55MBtu/hr and two (2) English Boiler &amp; Tube, Inc. at 99.8 MBtu/hr currently installed and operational. <br />All boilers are dual-fired for natural gas and No. 2 fuel oil. The four (4) Union Iron Works boilers are original to the facility, installed in 1962. The last heating plant condition assessment was performed in 1995, which led to the boiler plant expansion project in 1998 that installed the English Boilers. The NIST facility currently operates the heating plant under MDE permit. Although the operating permit retains the emission standard of 0.25 lbs. NOx per MBtu input limit, it is anticipated that compliance with stricter visible, NOx, and Sulfur Dioxide emission standards will be required for all future projects.<br />Chilled water is produced at 42&deg;F by Seven (7) centrifugal chillers rated at 3,500 tons using R-134a refrigerant.  There are six (6) centrifugal-chillers cooled by eight (8) counter-flow evaporative cooling tower cells.  They have a total available plant evaporative cooling capacity of 26,000 tons.  <br />In 2010 the chiller plant building extension and new cooling tower cell was completed to accommodate an increase of 3,500 refrigeration tons. The seven chillers give NIST a Plant firm capacity of 20,000 tons. The new cooling tower (cells 9 and 10) are separated from the original basins and can function independently from the other six chillers both in power and condenser water which directly supports the seventh chiller.    <br />Medium voltage (13.8 kV) electric spot network renovations/additions that utilize at least three independent feeders. Spot network (as defined by IEEE standard 1547 sub clause 4.1.4)- A type of electric distribution system that uses two or more inter-tied transformers to supply an electrical network circuit and is generally used to supply power to a single customer or a small group of customers.<br />NIST electrical spot network peak loads are approximately 26 MW.   Power is distributed via underground ducts and manholes to laboratories and administrative buildings.  Voltage distribution is 13.8 kV.  Network transformers step the voltage down to 480V.  Further unit substations with each building steps it down to 120/208V.  <br />How to respond to this sources sought notice:<br />If your company has recent experience within the last 60 months with projects that are similar in scope to what may be required by the upcoming procurement for Mechanical and Electrical A/E services, please provide the following information (10 pages maximum). <br />1.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC EXWC) will hold an industry day, tentatively scheduled for 12 September 2018, to seek feedback on the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Global Petroleum Oils and Lubricants (GPOL) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC). 

Potential offerors are requested to view the draft solicitation and provide comments or questions prior to the industry day; so the Government team can be prepared to answer the questions or respond to comments.  

The current intent is to issue the RFP using the two-phase Design-Build procedures listed at FAR 36.3.  The estimated value will be $880,000,000 (Shared capacity among all awardees), with an order period of 60 months.
While this is an unrestricted acquisition, there is a reserve for three small business concerns.  Post-award, projects that are performed in the 50 United States and below $2,000,000 will be restricted to just the small business reserve.  Orders above that threshold and / or performed outside of the 50 United States will be open to all MACC holders (awardees).  NAVFAC EXWC plans to award three unrestricted contracts and three small business reserve contracts.  Prospective awardees must have an aggregate bonding capacity of $15,000,000 or more.  The current contract expires on 29 February 2020, so the intent is to have all contracts awarded prior to that date.

The solicitations acquisition plan is still pending approval by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy  Acquisition and Procurement (DASN-AP).
 Likewise, the solicitation and evaluation factors have not received the higher level review; thus changes to the acquisition strategy, ordering period, and evaluations factors may be dictated.

The original synopsis utilized N3943018R2035, but the attached RFP utilizes N3943018R2014.  At the time the RFP is actually issued in fiscal year 2019, the number will change again. 

The industry day will be held at the Seabee Museum located at 3201 N. Ventura Road, Port Hueneme CA 93043, from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM.  The Seabee Museum is not within the perimeter of Naval Base Ventura County, so there are no special access requirements.  Due to the size of the theater where the Governments presentation will be held, firms are requested to send no more than two attendees per firm, including current or potential joint ventures.
 NAVFAC EXWC will provide an over-view of the GPOL program, as it pertains to this contract, an overview of the RFP and evaluation criteria, and then provide answers to questions previously submitted, and take questions from the attendees.  The date of 12 September 2018 is still in process with the museum.  If that date changes, an amendment will be issued to this announcement.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE, pursuant to FAR Part 10 (Market Research) and is not a pre-solicitation notice or solicitation for proposals/quotations.

<DESC>St. Cloud MN VA Overhead PA System Head End and Remote Amplifier System Replacement

NAICS Code: 541519
Solicitation Number: 36C26318Q9897
Notice Type: Request for Information (RFI)

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only; it is not a request for quotations or offers. 

52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)
(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
(b) Although  proposal  and  offeror  are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.
(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of: conducting market research to identify potential sources for a potential procurement of an Overhead PA System Head End and Remote Amplifier System Replacement as indicated below at the St. Cloud VA Healthcare System located at 4801 Veterans Drive, St. Cloud, MN 56303. To assist interested parties, a brief/general description (not all inclusive) is provided below:
Overhead paging system replacement for the St. Cloud MN VA Health Care System.

The current Dukane PA system and amplifiers need to be replaced with a new system that accommodates zone paging and timed recorded messages. The new system will include amplifiers, telephone interface equipment, master clock, recording device, and any other associated head end hardware/software for a fully operational system. The new system must maintain the existing coverage in buildings 1, 1A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 28, 29, 48, 49, 50, 51, 54, 57, 59, 88, 95, 96, 108, 109, 111, 112, 115, 116 and 118. Currently, there are 8 remote amplifiers located in the following locations:
Bldg 2 Room 1A 
Bldg 28 room 68
Bldg 29 room 15
Bldg 48 room 11B
Bldg 49 room 33
Bldg 50 room 23B
Bldg 51 room 1A
Bldg B118 room 4

The head end equipment for this system will be installed on the first floor of building 108, Room 112. The 8 existing remote amplifiers will be replaced in their existing locations. Existing speakers and cabling will be re-used.


The new paging system will include a telephone interface module for connection to the VA s existing Nortel CS 1000 PBX. This component is anticipated to be replaced in the near future by a Cisco Unified Call Manager. The contractor must verify with the VA prior to ordering and installing the telephone interface to ensure compatibility with the new system. Amplifier sizes, master clock, and recording devices for canned messages must be appropriate for system.
System is to be  Air Gapped  and not connected directly to the VA s internet system. The contractor is allowed to utilize the existing engineering fiber optic network that is looped throughout the major buildings on campus.
The following areas currently have internal paging to the whole facility and must also have this capability with the new system: 
Building 1 operators desk 
Building 111 room 5 (MAA office)
Building 108 room 112

The following stations must have the ability to transmit code blue and other messages:
Building 50 second floor nurse station to the whole facility (code blue)
Building 2 nursing stations to Building 2 only

Contractor will be required to connect the paging system head end to an equipment critical branch power source, and must be on a dedicated 20 amp minimum circuit. This is available at the location of the existing paging system and may be reused. Any system components not located at the head end (such as remote amplifiers) may utilize the nearest normal or emergency power source. Additional piping/wiring/devicing may be needed to provide power in the necessary locations. Conductors must be installed in   minimum EMT. Follow NEC codes for all electrical installations.

All low voltage cabling must be installed either in existing or new cable trays, or in new   minimum blue EMT. Free cabling or supporting with j-hooks or other means is not allowed.

Removal of old cable, amplifiers, head end components and any necessary cosmetic work to ceilings or other damage is the responsibility of the contractor.

Contractor will coordinate work with facility Point of Contact (POC).

Normal working hours are 8 am to 4:30 pm, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Holidays. Any request to for work outside normal hours must be submitted to the POC for approval 72 hours in advance.

Parts and labor warranty will be a period of two years. Contractor will return warranty related calls and/or emails within 24 hours and perform onsite service within 72 hours.

Paging System Specifications: 
Zone and zone group paging
Built-in talkback amplification
Background music (BGM) assigned per zone
Local BGM sourcing capability
Night ringer zone group
Emergency zone group with choice of built-in tones or outside tone source
Emergency all-facility page override
Eight daily time-triggered signaling events
pattern & echo code calling
Daily master clock synchronization
Relay driver per zone
Auxiliary contacts
Volume controls for each zone at head end

This is a request for information and sources only, which may or may not lead to a future solicitation. This is not a request for proposal (RFP). The VA will not pay for any information received resulting from this sources sought notice. Information should be forwarded to the Contract Specialist. Any questions should be addressed to the Contract Specialist, in writing, at the email address provided. Because this is a request for information only, answers to questions will not be posted.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Rock Island (ACC-RI),Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, Illinois, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (PM CAS) located at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey anticipates awarding two (2) or more Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with five (5) 12-month ordering periods for the 60mm (M204, M235, and M236), 81mm (M218, M219, M220), and 120mm (M234A1) Mortar Propelling Charges to companies who are within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB). Two (2) or more awards will be made utilizing Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2.
<p><br />The 60mm (M204, M235, and M236), 81mm (M218, M219, M220), and 120mm (M234A1) Mortar Propelling Charges are horseshoe shaped nitrocellulose (NC) containers that house the main charge propellant. The containers are molded as two separate halves that are eventually bonded together. The top half of the container has a loading hole to load the propellant prior to sealing the container with a closure tab. Once assembled, the propelling charge (maximum of four charges per mortar cartridge) is placed over the mortar fin assembly. When the ignition train is initiated, the hot gases generated inside the fin flash through the holes of the fin; therefore, igniting the propelling charges. The burning of the NC container and propellant produces enough gas pressure to force the mortar cartridge out of the tube and down range. The 60mm (M204, M235, and M236), 81mm (M218, M219, M220), and 120mm (M234A1) Mortar Propelling Charges use similar production materials and the same production processes.

<p>In order to receive an award, a successful offeror must have the capability to produce all of the 60mm (M204, M235, M236), 81mm (M218, M219, M220), and 120mm (M234A1) Mortar Propelling Charges. Offers that do not have the capability to produce all configurations of the 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm Propelling Charges, will not be considered for an award on this acquisition.</p>
<p>The maximum contract value will be $511,226,923 with a guaranteed minimum of $2,500 for each awarded contract. For planning purposes only, the estimated dollar amounts for each Mortar Propelling Charge variant is as follows:</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; The 10CONS/PKB, Operational Contracting Office, US Air Force Academy (USAFA) received a Sole Source justification for the purchase of 2-Automated Pharmacy Intellicab Will-Call systems cabinets to GSL SOLUTIONS, INC, 2414 SE 125th Avenue, Vancouver, WA 98683. This procurement will be a sole source acquisition IAW FAR Part 13.501.
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) number is 334118, Computer Terminal and Other Computer Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing. The business size standard is 1,000. <br />a. Only one responsible source and no other item will satisfy the USAFA requirement.</p>
<p>b. The USAFA pharmacy is part of the Colorado Springs Military Treatment Facility network that includes the Air Force Academy (USAFA), Peterson AFB, Fort Carson, Schriever and Cheyenne Mountain. An integral part of this network is a Joint Refill Center (JRC), located on USAFA. The prescriptions filled at the JRC are transported to each individual pharmacy daily via courier service. Peterson AFB purchased the GSL Solutions Intellicab Will Call System on 10 July 2018 and given this fact all subsequent purchases for units utilizing the JRC need to be compatible with GSL workstations and totes. It would be fiscally irresponsible, labor intensive and an infrastructural impossibility to have multiple will call systems operating at the same time within the JRC.</p>
<p>c. Given these facts and the fact that GSL solutions is the manufacturer and has not authorized third party vendors, makes this a sole source requirement. <br />This synopsis is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement can be conducted. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received NLT 10:00 pm Mountain Standard Time (MST) on 04 September 2018.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement. Contractors must have a current registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) at http://sam.gov/.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract processed IAW FAR 13. <br />Questions should be addressed to the Primary POC Dorrie Boughn, Contract Specialist, and (719) 333-4724 or sent via e-mail to dorothy.boughn@us.af.mil.

<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the ombudsmen,<br />James Anderson<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: james.anderson.72@us.af.mil</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Opportunity</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license an innovative neurotechnology to further develop and commercialize.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the current market trends is growth in neurotechnology-- specifically, brain-computer interfacing (BCI) as well as deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat a handful of afflictions, including: Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease, essential tremor, and major depression. Brain computer interfacing refers to connecting the brain&rsquo;s natural electrochemical properties to computers, in order to modulate or monitor the brain&rsquo;s activities. This usually comes in a non-invasive form using an electroencephalogram (EEG), which is a cap made of a mesh of electrodes, each able to pick up on the brain&rsquo;s unique wavelengths based on users&rsquo; thoughts. Those electrical impulses are then translated into digital signals and can result in digital data storage or controlled mechanical movement. Neural prosthetics have made large improvements in this space throughout the past decade.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">EEG offers researchers lots of avenues to explore potential uses of BCI, but the electrical signal from the brain is weak compared to more invasive methods, so the potential applications are limited. Invasive methods require surgery that involves drilling a hole into a patient&rsquo;s skull to implant one or more neural probes into the neural tissue. These probes often have multiple electrodes and are able to record chemical, electrical, and biological data from the surrounding tissue. Some electrodes are able to emit small electrical pulses, stimulating the surrounding neurons.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For chronic DBS implantation, wires connect to the top of the probes and are implanted underneath the skin of the patient and extend down the neck, to a small implanted electronics device usually at the top of the chest. The FDA has approved DBS to treat Parkinson&rsquo;s and essential tremor, and there are currently over 160 active DBS clinical trials worldwide to treat a wide variety of indications.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">This technology relates to a modular system for deep brain stimulation (DBS) and electrocorticography (ECoG). The system has an implantable neuromodulator for generating electrical stimulation signals adapted to be applied to a desired region of a brain via an attached electrode array. An aggregator module is used for collecting and aggregating electrical signals and transmitting the electrical signals to the neuromodulator. A control module that communicates with the aggregator module is used for controlling generation of the electrical signals and transmitting the electrical signals to the aggregator.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other currently available DBS systems are considered &ldquo;open loop,&rdquo; which allow a physician to adjust the DBS setting based on direct feedback from the patient, such as how they are feeling with each incremental change in treatment. However, this method is time-delayed and based on subjective observations from the patient.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">LLNL is developing a &ldquo;closed loop&rdquo; stimulation system, which monitors neuron activity and automatically adjust its own electric pulses based on real-time electrode information. Closed loop DBS systems hold promise in tailoring treatment to the individualized needs of each patient. This neuromodulation system is an advanced apparatus made up of state-of-the-art components.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A handful of companies currently develop and sell invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems to healthcare providers, but only few of them provide connectors needed for DBS research. Moreover, the connectors currently in the market are neither robust nor reliable; they are widely considered ineffective by the research community.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A high density percutaneous chronic connector, having first and second connector structures each having an array of magnets surrounding a mounting cavity. This connector can be fabricated from biocompatible material, and has a long lifetime and a high density of electrical feedthroughs. The magnetic closure apparatus enables a quick-release feature, which is particularly useful when working with animal models that may dislodge the connector. Without the quick-release feature, the apparatus would be damaged and the experiment would need repeating, costing time and money.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) played a critical role in developing the world&rsquo;s first artificial retina. Also known as the &ldquo;bionic eye,&rdquo; this retinal prosthesis was developed for people blinded by retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration. LLNL engineers developed a flexible microelectrode array that conforms to the curved shape of the retina. Second Sight, a company that collaborated with LLNL, developed it further and received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first high-density, microfabricated, and fully implantable neural prosthetic ever produced. The device partially restores sight to blind individuals.</span><br /><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;">

<p class="MsoNormal">Many types of devices are available in smaller, sleeker shapes, which require their internal electronics to flex, bend, and stretch as they do. The ability for circuits to stretch and bend allows them to fit into spaces where rigid printed circuit boards cannot. Flexible circuits also offer the advantage of being thinner and lighter, and examples of these can currently be found in implantable devices such as pacemakers, defibrillators, and cochlear implants.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There has been a steady increase in patent filings since 2013 with regard to &ldquo;smart clothing&rdquo; (clothing that monitors the wearer&rsquo;s physical condition, providing biometric data such as pulse rate, temperature, muscle strength, heart rhythm and physical movement). Industrial facilities are looking to adopt smart clothing as a way to improve workers&rsquo; efficiency, and both professional and casual athletes are looking for tools to monitor and record their workouts and progress. Additionally, developers are seeking better ways to incorporate electronics into clothing to help monitor the daily activities of many kinds of potential users- from young children to the elderly- for both health and safety information.</p>

The stretchable circuit can conform to both external (i.e., legs, neck, arms) and internal (i.e., neural, spinal, cochlear) body surfaces. The robust, biocompatible, stretchable polymer body composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) can be made in batch processes and provides a low-cost device that is ready for long-term implantation or wearing without the need for additional packaging steps.</span></span></span><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">

<p class="MsoNormal">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license an innovative neurotechnology to further develop and commercialize.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Any sort of implant, whether a pacemaker, deep brain stimulator pulse generator, or cortical implant, must be hermetically sealed to both protect the internal electronics of the device from the surrounding corrosive biological environment, and protect the patient from the potential toxicity of the electronics components.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The central challenge of any implant is to hermetically seal the electronic components, while maintaining sufficient feedthrough channels for external electronic communication. Typically, as the task complexity of a device increases, more feedthroughs are required. However, for each feedthrough, many surface-surface interfaces are introduced, each of which is a potential point of hermetic failure and leakage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This LLNL portfolio encompasses multiple novel methods to fabricate high density feedthroughs for implantable devices and other packaging needs, while ensuring hermetic seals.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This invention entails a hermetically sealed electronics package of a multi-electrode neural prosthesis system, where the sealed enclosure communicates with external components via feedthroughs. The feedthrough density is increased, however, via signal demultiplexing prior to feedthrough submission.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This invention improves performance of long-term wireless, implantable devices by increasing signal density via demultiplexing. Additionally, this reduces the overall electronics package size, which is especially important in neural implants. The demultiplexing also reduces wireless data/power telemetry limitations.&nbsp;</p>

Each feedthrough construction has an electrically insulating substrate and an array of electrically conductive feedthroughs, to form a hermetically sealed enclosure. A set of electronic components are located within the hermetically sealed enclosure and are operably connected to the feedthroughs of the first and second feedthrough constructions to electrically communicate outside the package from opposite sides of the package.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This technology provides a scalable fabrication method for producing high-density, bio-compatible, hermetic electrically conductive feedthroughs in a range of substrate thicknesses.

The method involves adding and removing scaffolding, to form a seamless block of electrically insulating material that conforms to the shape of the suspended trace beam structure. Electrical contacts, electrodes, or leads of the traces are exposed from the encapsulated trace beam structure by removing the substrate. This method of fabrication uses advanced, reproducible, microfabrication processes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">Animal testing is used as a proxy to assess organic- and systemic-level response to drugs in advance of human clinical trials. However, human safety and drug performance is not always accurately predicted through animal testing. Therefore, there is a need to develop engineered human tissue to mimic human physiological systems. Standard scientific approaches that have been used to integrate vascular networks into engineered tissue include: 1) biodegradable scaffolds that release angiogenic growth factors and 2) microfluidic channels seeded with vascular cells and stacked to form 3D networks. The rationale for these strategies has been described in detail. However, challenges in directional control of vessel growth within 3D scaffolds, and the planarity of 2D microfluidic channels limit their physiological geometry.</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">Biological printing has the potential to surpass traditional scaffold-based tissue engineering. The invention describes a more advanced printing technique that allows continuous free-form printing of biological material within a self-healing hydrogel to assemble complex omnidirectional microvascular networks that range from micron to millimeter in diameter. This technique will allow the growth of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>microvascular networks with spatial physiological morphology, as well as an understanding of tissue assembly and nutrient diffusion requirements to maintain long-term tissue survival.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">Notably, the tissue systems, networks, etc. are physiologically-relevant, i.e. exhibiting one or more characteristics indicative of physiological relevance, such as a substantially fractal geometry, inter-vessel spacing, cellular composition, dermal structure, concentric multi-layered structure, etc.</p>

Less than 1% of potential new pharmaceuticals reach market and greater than 10% of those demonstrate serious unanticipated adverse effects that cause market withdrawal and significant costs in litigation. This process is a result of an antiquated system that involves testing without consideration of mechanism of action in animal models that often do not reflect human biology.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">This invention describes a novel system that combines primary human cells, tissue engineering, and novel microfluidics, creating an <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in vitro</em> platform to reproduce <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">in vivo</em> physiological response to study the effects of exposure to toxins. This platform provides a highly-integrated, multi-organ, human-relevant tissue reactor for rapidly assessing and predicting the toxicity, safety and efficacy of new drug entities with the goal of accelerating both development and regulatory approval of drugs. This advancement could shorten the development time by an estimated 50% and reduce the cost of human clinical trials through earlier selection of winning therapeutic candidates. The technology demonstrates an assembly of computer-controlled reactors designed to support living human cells and tissues enabling precise control of environmental conditions to maintain long term cell functionality, imaging, stimulation and recording with electrophysiological multi-electrode arrays, and biochemical sensing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license an innovative neurotechnology to further develop and commercialize</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Implantable neurostimulation is undoubtedly the fastest growing application area for implantable electronics in medicine. The implantable neurostimulation market was valued at about $3.5 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at a steady pace.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Research involving neural monitoring and modulation offers key insights into the development, prognosis and treatment of disease. Deep brain stimulation is already an approved therapy to treat Parkinson&rsquo;s and essential tremor. A key challenge for researchers remains how to initially insert the multielectrode array, while minimizing the level of damage to the surrounding tissue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the probe is rigid, micro movements may cause additional damage and result in glial scarring. If the probe is flexible, its insertion is very difficult.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This portfolio offers a variety of methods for neural probe insertion, each tool with its own set of unique advantages to meet the needs of the type of research being conducted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This invention combines a rigid stiffening shank with a flexible body polymer, using a wicking channel and capillary action to distribute the adhesive. Once the probe is inserted, the stiffening shank may be removed, leaving only the flexible polymer body behind.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This invention is superior to silicon based neural probes, as it reduces localized damage induced by post-insertion movements. It is also more useful than purely polymer based probes, which are unable to penetrate neural tissue and therefore require an initial incision in the form of additional surgery, which may result in more glial damage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Additionally, this stiffening shank apparatus may be easily and efficiently fabricated in large numbers.</p>

These fibers are commercially available and can be made as small as 50 &mu;m in diameter, however they are not ideal. At 50-200 &mu;m in diameter, the fibers are still too large to implant and study many important regions of the brain. Each fiber provides only one point of </span> light source and one wavelength. There is a need for a light delivery system that is able to deliver multiple wavelengths as needed and in multiple areas, all with a minimal device footprint. Optical fibers also have low light delivery efficiency. Often a 100 mW source is required to deliver 1-5 mW to the desired site. The fiber optics is implanted separately and relatively far from the signal recording device. There is a need for a system wherein the recording electrodes are placed within microns of the delivered light source and the stimulated cells.
<p class="MsoNormal">This invention addresses the unmet need for targeted neural stimulation, which is achieved by delivering multiple wavelengths to multiple neural areas with minimal device footprint.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">This invention provides thicker electrodes on microelectronic devices using thermo-compression bonding. A thin-film electrical conducting layer forms electrical conduits and bulk depositing provides an electrode layer on the thin-film electrical conducting layer. An insulating polymer layer encapsulates a thin-film of electrically conducting layer and the electrode layer. Some of the insulating layer is removed to expose the electrode layer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">This technology is advantageous for long-term implantation of electrodes in animal or human subjects, as the thickness of the electrode dramatically increases the electrode&rsquo;s lifetime. This feature is important in <span style="mso-ansi-language: EN;" lang="EN">medical and military sensor applications, where electrodes that can survive harsh environments for long periods of time are necessary.</span><br /><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN;" lang="EN">

<DESC>USPFO of Louisiana intends to award a sole source procurement to Southern Hospitality Group, LLC, 701 4th Street, Alexandria, LA 71301-8431. The award is in support of the Yellow Ribbon event supporting the 165th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion held in Alexandria, LA on 7-9 September 2018. This procurement is being made pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) 1 and FAR Part 6.302-1, for other than full and open competition; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 532420 and the small business size standard is $32.5 million. This has been determined to be the best and most effective option for the government considering duplication of effort costs. The government has completed extensive market research and found that only one hotel can accommodate the requirements of the Reintegration Office (hotel rooms and meals) and the requirements of the meeting space in close proximity of the hotel. All potential qualified sources must respond not later than 29 August 1000 CST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice: NB686090-18-03617<br />Project Title: Valved Gallium Cell for Molecular Beam Epitaxy<br />This is a Sources Sought Notice ONLY. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not receive a response.
<p>This Notice is for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation or an obligation on the part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for conducting a follow-on acquisition. NIST does not intend to make an award based on this Notice, or otherwise pay for the information requested.

In the absence of such identification, NIST will assume to have unlimited rights to all technical data in the information paper.<br /><br />NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Quantitative Nanostructure Characterization group in PML seeks to acquire a valved effusion cell for producing a gallium beam for highly controlled growths of GaN and related alloy materials using molecular beam epitaxy. To support PML's optoelectronic projects, it is critical to procure a valved effusion cell compatible with the existing nitride Veeco Gen10 molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system, known as GM1. Convential gallium effusion cells have produced unsatisfactory variations in flux in our process. <br />A recent development in effusion cell technology has been made where a corrosion resistant valve can limit the flux within the crucible, removing the worry of exterior cell contamination and material dripping from the shutter back into the crucible. Additionally, the ability to vary the flux without changing the temperature provides a tremendous increase in growth capabilities. Changing the temperature, and subsequent flux, of traditional effusion cells takes a considerable amount of time whereas adjusting the valve position would give us much more tunability and stability of flux.</p>
<p>Requirement:</p>
<p>NIST is seeking information on contractors who can provide the following:<br />Item 1: Model VC-090-450-1140<br />Item 2: Model AVP-1000</p>

<p>Request for Information (RFI) for AEGIS Tech Insertion 16 MK6 MOD 0 Hardware Integration</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) N00164-18-S-NC04:</p>
<p>This RFI is being issued by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Radar Technologies Division.  The Government is conducting market research to determine if the data the Government has is sufficient for a Contractor to perform hardware integration tasks in support of the U.S. Navy's AEGIS Tech Insertion (TI)16 MK6 MOD 0.</p>
<p>Conceptually, a hardware integrator would be responsible for repair and procurement of those parts which are essential to the successful operation and execution of the MK6 MOD 0 system.  In some cases, an integrator may also be required to procure these items in order to maintain adequate stock levels for the MK6 MOD 0 system as it is deployed fleetwide.</p>
<p>The Government recognizes that, although the current Technical Data Package (TDP) includes both drawings and 3D models, it also has shortcomings; therefore, NSWC Crane is seeking industry help to identify TDP shortfalls and gain insight into current market capabilities.<br />NSWC Crane is seeking recommendations, advice, and feedback from industry regarding the degree to which the TDP (as-is) could be relied upon for successful performance of the hardware integration tasking described above. <br />RESPONSE FORMAT:  <br />1.	Complete and submit Attachment 1 AEGIS TI16 UNIQUE PARTS - REPAIRABLES: fill in "Contractor Response" column for each hardware component listed.  <br />a.	Given the condition of the TDP, can this item be repaired? Y/N and amplifying remarks as appropriate.  <br />b.	If unsuitable for repair, does your company have a method to procure a new replacement item?  Y/N and amplifying remarks as appropriate (note: no deviations/substitutes).</p>
<p>2.	Complete and submit Attachment 2 AEGIS TI16 UNIQUE PARTS - CONSUMABLES: fill in "Contractor Response" column for each item. <br />a.	Does your company have a method to procure the item?  Y/N and amplifying remarks as appropriate (note: no deviations/substitutes).</p>
<p>3.	Submit a whitepaper (not to exceed 20pgs), addressing the questions listed below. In addition to addressing these questions, NSWC Crane invites additional details, suggestions, and recommendations:</p>
<p>a) Given the current condition of the TDP, what challenges, risks, and obstacles do you foresee?  If possible, also provide a potential mitigation for each problem area.</p>
<p>b) Is there sufficient information available in the TDP to PROCURE the items listed in Attachments 1 and 2?  If no, what additional information would be required?</p>
<p>c) Is there sufficient information available in the TDP to REPAIR the items in Attachments 1? If no, what additional information would be required?</p>
<p>d) Should the Government anticipate a request for special test equipment associated with these hardware items?  If yes, please describe.</p>
<p>e)  Is your company capable of developing acceptance test plans for these items?  If not, what test and acceptance procedures would apply?</p>
<p>f) What improvements should be made to the current TDP that would help facilitate this requirement?</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government's System for Award Management (SAM) and the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive the special notice attachment.  Offeror's may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov.

This RFI is issued solely for conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 and gathering information for planning purposes. This is NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSAL and no contract will be awarded from this RFI.</p>

<DESC><div>The Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Port Hueneme Division intends to award a single source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, to Raveon, Technologies Corporation for the procurement of a VHF Radio Modem with GPS including Software and services to support development of the replacement system. Currently the Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) tracks test aircraft using GPS software proprietary to Raveon Technologies Corporation. The GPS data is used as truth data for the system under test and for tracking the aircraft for the conduct of the test. The hardware and software being bought will be integrated in to the existing system. The effort is to replace out dated and not supported hardware and software. The output of the data is in a format that is compatible with the existing software and will require little to no modifications. The acquisition of a different modem and software would require the existing software to be modified to accept the different data rates.&nbsp; The different data rates would also impact the usability as truth data for high speed aircraft testing. Requested items are essential in the support of testing events for various missions for the Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) for NAVSEA-PHD.&nbsp;</div>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to Sole source to Odulair LLC, a Woman Owned Small Business. This is for 12 station portable dialysis trailers (2 trailers) currently located on the Island of St. Croix United States Virgin Island.<br />This will be under NAICS code 621492 Kidney Dialysis Center. The dialysis trailers with 12 stations will treat evacuee dialysis patients returning to the island and patients already on the island. This will augment the hospital's lack of available stations.<br />The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response is responding to the need for additional dialysis stations to treat evacuee patients that should be returning to the USVI by early September and the local hospital does not have the capacity to treat additional patients. <br />The contractor Odulair currently has 2 portable dialysis trailers on the island with a total of 12 stations and HHS's intention is to sole source to this woman owned small business because they are the only known company that have available for use, functional portable dialysis trailers on the island. The set up phase is at least week, so time is critical in having the trailers already on the island. The stations have to be functional and ready to use when the evacuated dialysis patients return. The trailers will be paid in TBD location on the island with access to local medical staff who will be treating the patients.<br />The contract will be for a possible 7 months. Two month base period and five one month options.<br />

<p>Addendum 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items (Oct 2014)<br />2. Basis for Contract Award: A single contract will be awarded to the Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by this solicitation) and is evaluated, based on the evaluation factors, to represent the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal resulting in overall best value to the Government. An order may be awarded to the contractor who is deemed responsible IAW FAR 9.1, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitations's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by the solicitation instructions) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors, to represent the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest complete and reasonable price. Offers will be evaluated utilizing the following evaluation criteria:</p>
<p>A. Technical: The Government will review the contractor's proposed technical approach to verify it will result in successful contract performance. Technical proposals will be assessed in accordance with Table 1 below. The evaluation team shall evaluate the below subfactors and determine Pass (acceptable) or Fail (unacceptable) ratings outlined in Table 1.</p>
<p>i. Management Plan: This subfactor evaluates the contractor's ability to provide a sound and realistic Management Plan to provide services without introducing unacceptable risk. The management plan, or any portion thereof, could become an attachment to the contract at award. The Offeror must provide a Management Plan that demonstrates its capability and capacity to meet the requirements as outline in the PWS to include the appropriate and mix of technical personnel. The offeror provides an organizational chart identifying key personnel with a description of their work experience and all required certifications/licenses required to perform these services. At a minimum, the proposed approach shall thoroughly substantiate all of the following:<br />ii. A block diagram identifying the individuals (management and supervisors) associated with this requirement to include: <br />a) Key personnel: Each individual's name, title, duty, certifications, licenses, years of experience, and experience level relating to similar contracts in size and scope. <br />b) Proof of current licenses and certification from the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation to meet local certification requirements in the maintenance, repair and inspection of Vertical Transportation Equipment (elevators).<br />c) Proof of valid state drivers' license for all vehicle operators, as well as current vehicle registration and proof of insurance. <br />Standard: The management plan shall provide an approach to successfully manage and execute the contract at the acceptable performance level without introducing unacceptable risk. The management plan is acceptable when it successfully meets the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. The offeror demonstrates a sound approach to management throughout the life of the contract. The offeror describes the appropriate number and mix of technical personnel with the required certifications/experience to meet the requirements on the PWS. <br />iii. Quality Control Plan: Offerors shall provide a draft Quality Control Plan (QCP) describing their Quality Management System (QMS). In order to meet the government's quality requirements, a contractor's QMS should be robust enough and resourced adequately to execute four key quality functions: 1) Detection of quality program problems and defects; 2) Identification of root causes for quality related problems/defects; 3) Correction of root causes related to detected problems/defects; and, 4) Follow-up to ensure quality related problems/defects do not recur. Furthermore, a mature QMS requires the contractor be the proactive party on quality. The goal is to obtain performance reflective of continuous improvement with no reliance on COR's surveillance to detect problems/defects, determine root causes, or ensure quality related problems/defects do not recur. After contract award, a finalized Quality Control Plan shall be required from the apparent awardee no later than twenty (20) calendar days after the award of the contract for approval IAW the PWS.</p>
<p>Standard: The quality control plan shall thoroughly substantiate all of the following:</p>
<p>a. A description of the contractor's quality control processes and procedures, including a chart showing lines of authority. The QCP Manager shall report to the project manager or someone higher in the organization. The project manager in this context shall mean the individual with responsibility for the overall management of the project including quality and production.</p>

<p>Proposal Content: Proposals shall consist of two separate parts, a technical proposal and a price proposal. Length of the proposal shall not exceed ten (10) typed pages.</p>
<p>Proposal Detail: The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the offeror intends to meet the listed requirements. Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities and experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the offer submitted.</p>
<p>Embellishments Not Desired: Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed artwork or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired.</p>
<p>Technical Proposal: Describe how the offeror will provide for the painting services as described in the SOW.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>The Government will use Simplified Acquisition Procedures permitted by FAR 12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items to evaluate proposals submitted in response to the solicitation. The factors that shall be used to evaluate proposals are Technical and Price, as expounded below. Evaluation will be based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - Technical: Pursuant to evaluation of all requirements, the Technical factor will receive an overall rating of either "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable" using the rating and descriptions in the table below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Rating</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acceptable</p>
<p>Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unacceptable</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In determining whether a technical proposal is Acceptable or Unacceptable, the Government will consider the extent to which the technical proposal demonstrates the offeror's ability to meet all of the factors as outlined in the Statement of Work (Attachment 1):</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - Price: Price proposals will be evaluated to determine if unit prices are fair and reasonable using the techniques described in FAR 13.106-3(a).<br />Evaluation Process:<br />(a) The Government will initiate concurrent evaluation of all evaluation factors on all proposals. The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of a proposal including whether any proposal deficiency can be rectified and whether any uncertainty can be resolved. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>(b) If, pursuant to initial evaluation, the Government rates the Technical factor as "Unacceptable", or if the Government determines that there is some other deficiency or uncertainty relative to an offeror's proposal, and in the Government's judgment, the deficiency is rectifiable or the uncertainty is resolvable, the Contracting Officer (CO) may open discussions and may continue discussions as long as, in the Government's judgment, the deficiency is rectifiable or the uncertainty is resolvable.</p>
<p>(c) For the purpose of conducting discussions, if the Government rates the Technical factor as "Unacceptable", or if the Government determines that there is some other deficiency or uncertainty relative to an offeror's proposal, the entire proposal will be rated "Unacceptable." At the conclusion of discussions, if the Technical factor is rated "Unacceptable", or if any deficiency or uncertainty relative to the proposal has not been resolved, evaluation of that proposal will be considered final. The entire proposal will be rated "Unacceptable" and no further consideration will be given to that proposal for award.</p>
<p>(d) For the purpose of award without discussions, if pursuant to initial evaluation, the Government rates the Technical factor as "Unacceptable", or if the Government determines that there is some other deficiency or uncertainty relative to an offeror's proposal, notwithstanding that any deficiency may be rectifiable or any uncertainty may be resolvable, the entire proposal will be rated "Unacceptable," the initial evaluation will be the final evaluation, and no further consideration will be given to that proposal for award. <br />Unless the Government has received a prior written notice that an offeror has withdrawn its proposal, the Government may accept the proposal in whole or in part before the proposal's expiration date.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>SAT)


Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 02, Northport Medical Center; Network Contracting Office 2, 800 Poly Place, Brooklyn, NY 11209.  Requisition Number: 632-18-3-3086-0309 to purchase Sizewise LLC, Long Term Care (LTC) Hospital Bed System.

This is a commercial item and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements applies, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2. 

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:   This brand name only, only one responsible source, justification requirement is based on Northport s decision to standardize medical bed and specialty mattress systems currently utilized in facility (in use on unit since February 2013) to maintain the highest possible standards of care insuring that care givers can provide consistent protocols when they consistently use the same safe patient handling features.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

 ( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

( X) FAR13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items:  The authority for applying the Simplified Procedures for Commercial Items of  FAR 13.5 is 41 U.S.C. 1901 and it is implemented for restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). 

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  The recent, fiscal year 2017acquisition of Sizewise LTC bed system must coordinate with the additional acquisition of this request meeting the design requirements and standardization throughout the facility. 

This is a highly specialized specialty bed series manufactured by Sizewise, whose technology and design is built for critical fall prevention, reporting and non-restraint features for at-risk patient populations. Specifically, this is an LTC Bed System that functions as a fall prevention safeguard with a deck low of 9  bed exit alarm, scale system with thirty-day patient history, multi language capable, voice recordable audio alerts, integration with nurse call and head wall system featuring high and low priority alerts, 850lb capacity and the ability for frames to expand from39  to 42  to 48 , and with specialized Cocoa Coloring matching facility design standards.
This is the rational and explanation to support the cited authority: The facility recently acquired beds and rents the Evolution and LowBoy Beds with these characteristics from the listed source, Sizewise. The Northport VAMC has a requirement to standardize with existing medical bed systems currently utilized in the facility, in order to maintain the highest possible standards of care.  Care givers can provide consistent protocols when consistently using the same safe patient handling features. The recent acquisition and rental of bed frames must coordinate with the additional acquisition of this request meeting the design requirements and standardization throughout the facility. Capability of nurse call functions; bed exit and protocol timer is also required to be consistent throughout the caregivers  environment of care. The facility must also maintain consistency in operations and training allowing current personnel the ability to effective train new personnel if needed. Limiting confusion with multiple bed systems will maintain safety of both caregiver and patient.  Safe Patient Handling protocols state that it is best to continue operations with uniform equipment versus trying to learn multiple systems. In addition, the time required for training VA personnel on a different bed system will not be necessary.
These are the highly specialized items only available against the Sizewise LTC bed system:
850 lb. Safe Working Load 
7.5 and 9  Deck Low Position 
Deck Height of 30.75  
Bed can transport a patient in any high or low position.
Bed Deck Width 35  and expandable option from 39" to 42" to 48" Deck length 82 
Open architecture based platform to accommodate a wide array of specialty mattress systems and patient needs. 
Caregiver Lockout Controls 
Nurse Call Interface
Patient Hand Pendent with a Dual Pendent Option
One touch Cardio Chair Positioning
One touch CPR and Manual CPR Release
One touch Trendelenburg and Reverse Trendelenburg 
Under Bed Lighting
Side Rails must be fully removable and accommodate one, two, three, four or no rail configurations meeting CLC requirements for side rails as restraints.
Seizure Pads for head/foot board and side rails required 
Mocha Bed Color Option meeting VHA DIRECTIVE 1140.11 UNIFORM GERIATRICS & EXTENDED CARE SERVICES IN VA MEDICAL CENTERS   Home Like Feel Requirement VA Homelike Feel Directive
Integrated 3 Stage bed exit alarm with three sensitivity settings, five different audible alarm tones, Voice recordable alarm feature, Nurse call interface notifies nurses  station when alarm triggers
Integrated bed scale weighs patient in bed, Weights read in lb. and kg., automatically weighs patient daily, stores scrolling 30-day weight history.
A-Frame and Single Pole Trapeze options
Integrated battery backup 
Room Environment controls for television, lighting and nurse call.
High and Low Priority Alerts via 37 PIN configuration (integration with head wall system)
Protocol Timer programmable intervals of 1, 2 or 4 hours audible tone on unit, nurse call interface notifies nurses  station when triggered.
120V Power Outlet   Foot End (Multi-Port Configuration Desirable)
Bed System is Evacusled Compatible

In addition, the VA is looking to meet the requirements set forth by Executive Order 13514 and GEMS (Green Environmental Management Systems) by making acquisitions of products that are Environmentally Sustainable. Part of this requirement is to reduce the Heavy Metals found in medical products. 

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: Northport VAMC seeks to attain consistency in use of one style of hospital bed system. If a new style of equipment was brought into the facility additional training to teach personnel how to use it would be needed. Confusion could cause a safety issue and it is best to continue the standard equipment from one source with the same type operation versus trying to learn multiple operations. 

In addition, the time required for training VA personnel on a different bed system will not be necessary. This results in a cost savings from not having productivity/time expended on additional training. Due to the requirements for a  Home Like Feel  and the specialized  color matched  design of the bed frames, in the VA Community Living Environment, the Northport VAMC s Community Living Center must have a timely procurement of bed frames to satisfy the needs of current Veteran patient population.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>SAT)


Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 02, New Jersey Healthcare System, East Orange Medical Center; Network Contracting Office 2, 800 Poly Place, Brooklyn, NY 11209.  Purchase Stryker LLC, Medical Surgical Hospital Bed Systems.

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:   This request is for the purchase of Stryker LLC, brand name only, Stryker Secure 3 MedSurg Bed System. This is a commercial item and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements applies, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2. 

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:   This brand name only, only one responsible source, justification requirement is based on East Orange Campus s decision to standardize medical bed and specialty mattress systems currently utilized in facility (in use on unit since February 2013) to maintain the highest possible standards of care insuring that care givers can provide consistent protocols when they consistently use the same safe patient handling features. 

Salient Features:
Bed Frame must meet minimum technical requirements:

Bed must have retractable Frame design and required to retract up to but not exceed 14 inches when head of bed is fully elevated. Meet Requirement: A retractable frame design help to keep patient in place when the head of bed is raised/lowered, reducing the need for caregivers to boost and lift patient while head of bed is articulated to reduce foot end migration which is alignment with EOVA's safe patient handling initiative and no lift policy. **Stryker Exclusive

Bed frame must have patient monitoring system equipped with 3 zones. Alarm controls on the foot board will be required with this function. Meet Requirement: Stryker's patented center of gravity based chaperone bed exit system with zone control (3 zones) is located on the foot board of the bed located away from patient reach to prevent patient from disarming safety feature. **Stryker Exclusive

Bed frame must have Safe Bed monitoring system that monitors specific bed positions - (bed exit alarm status, 30 Degree head of bed, side rail position, low bed height, and brake settings). A digital display that illustrates compromised safety parameters located on footboard will be required for his function. Meet Requirement: Stryker iBed Awareness monitoring system alerts caregiver not only that a condition has changed but specifically which parameter needs immediate attention located on a digital display on the footboard. This helps keep the bed in a safe position for the patient which mitigates risk for adverse events and promotes proper healing for the patient. This feature is also in alignment with EOVA's falls policy. **Stryker Exclusive
Bed frame must be equipped with bed motion controls located on both side rails and main controls located on footboard to keep key functions away from patient reach. Meet Requirement: Secure 3 bed frame is equipped with bed motion lockout, bed alarm button, and scale located on main controls at the footboard, away from patient reach to prohibit patient from reaching said functions and altering caregiver bed settings and disarming safety features which can help prevent adverse events from occurring.
Bed Frame must be equipped with a minimum of two sturdy grip points for patient to utilize during bed exit with 3 positions (full up, full down, and middle position). Meet Requirement: Two sturdy grip points allow patient to use own body strength to safely exit bed, taking stress and strain off caregiver by reducing the need for caregiver to physically lift patient. This feature is in alignment with EOVA no lift policy to promote caregiver safety and safe patient handling. **Stryker Exclusive
Bed frame must have the ability to weigh patient in any position and is required to store previously recorded weights. Exceeds Requirement- Secure 3 will weigh patients in any position and can store up to 10 weights to monitor a patient's weight gain/loss for better accuracy of caregiver documentation. **Stryker Exclusive
Bed frame must have pressure sensitive downward motion interrupt system. Meet Requirement
Bed frame must be equipped with 30 degree Head of Bed function with Head of Bed lock to increase accuracy of set protocol. Exceeds Requirement: Secure 3 offers a one touch 30 degree head of bed button with lock out for increase accuracy of clinical intervention. Secure 3, 30 degree lock feature will allow patient to articulate fowler above 30 degrees, just not below to ensure clinical accuracy for said protocol when lock out is engaged. **Stryker Exclusive

Bed frame must have digital fowler angle indicator located on footboard control panel. Meet Requirement

Bed frame must have central braking system with wide brake pedal located at the center of the bed for easy access. Exceeds Requirement: Allows caregiver to access brake pedal from both sides of the bed frame even when the bed is in the lowest position and side rails are lowered reducing unnecessary strain while accessing brake pedal. Stryker's central brake is 15' wide which is the biggest brake among leading competitors. **Stryker Exclusive
Bed frame must have integrated pump holder. Meet Requirement: This feature is necessary to provide location for external mattress/SCD pumps to hang to reduce bedside clutter.
Bed Frame must have Trend/Reverse Trend capabilities. Meet Requirement
Bed Frame must have Cardiac chair position. Meet Requirement
Each bed must have an emergency cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) release at the head of the bed. Meet Requirement
Each bed must have removable headboard and footboard for improved patient access. Meet Requirement
Bed must have permanent 1.V pole attached to bed frame. Meet Requirement
Each bed is required to have adapter Bracket to accommodate patient helper. Meet Requirement
The bed frame must have ability to lengthen up to but not exceed 94" in length to accommodate tall patients. Meet Requirement.  **Stryker Exclusive
The bed is required to have safe working load not to exceed 500 lbs. weight capacity with required capability clearly marked on the frame. Meet Requirement
Bed frame must have held patient pendant including motion controls with one handed operation. Meet Requirement
Bed frame must have built in (2) 110v accessory outlets. Meet Requirement
Night light is required for bed frame. Meet Requirement
Bed frame must have dual Pedestal lift design for easy cleaning for infection control.  Meet Requirement
Bed frame is required to have steer control located at the head of bed for easy access for transporter. Meet Requirement
Bed frame must have four Foley bag hooks. Meet Requirement
Bed is required to have open architecture design-flat litter deck to accommodate various mattresses. Meet Requirement
Mattress must meet minimum technical requirements:
Mattress is required to have gel technology for pressure ulcer treatment and prevention. Meet Requirement: Gel will move freely with the patient to help minimize shear forces at the interface between the surface and the patient preventing pressure ulcers from developing associated with shear/friction. **Stryker Exclusive
Mattress must have sacral gel support located in the sacral region. Meet Requirement: Sacral gel helps to redistributes pressure by buckling and absorbing the patient's weight, allowing immersion and envelopment to take place which helps to prevent pressure ulcers associated with pressure, helping to improve patient outcomes and promote proper healing.  **Stryker Exclusive
Mattress must have 10 year warranty. Meet Requirement: A ten year warranty will ensure longevity and durability of the mattress and lower the cost of ownership with durable gel design. **Stryker Exclusive
Mattress must have ability to administer Low Air Loss Therapy.  Meet Requirement: Low air loss therapy is vital for managing the  heat and humidity of the patient's skin.  This therapy helps to prevent pressure ulcers from developing associated with moisture.
Mattress dimensions must be: 84" long, 35" wide, 6" thick. Meet Requirement
Mattress must have foam crib and base provide stability and lateral support. Meet Requirement
Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  The facility recently acquired beds and mattress systems with these aforementioned salient characteristics from the listed source, Stryker. The East Orange Campus has a requirement to standardize with existing medical bed systems currently utilized in facility, to maintain the highest possible standards of care so that care givers can provide consistent protocols, when they consistently use the same safe patient handling features. The recent Fiscal Year 2017 acquisition of this same Stryker bed system must coordinate with the additional acquisition of this request meeting the design requirements and standardization throughout the facility. The facility must also maintain consistency in operations and training allowing current personnel the ability to effective train new personnel if needed. Limiting confusion with multiple bed systems will maintain safety of both caregiver and patient, and Safe Patient Handling protocols state that it is best to continue operations with uniform equipment versus trying to learn multiple systems.  In addition, the time required for training VA personnel on a different bed system will not be necessary. 

The new work is a logical follow-on to an award placed in Fiscal Year 2017 with Trillamed, an SDVOSB Stryker, LLC authorized vendor for this exact same hospital bed system.

To mix manufacturers/models of beds would require multiple service contracts, extensive operator s training for our Nursing staff, cleaning instructions for the Housekeeping staff and preventative maintence training for our FMS staff. All of the aforementioned would be at considerable cost to the VA. 

Salient features listed above justify the brand name request for procurement of Stryker Secure 3 MedSurg Bed. 

Accordingly, Stryker is the only firm capable of providing the supplies described in Section 3. above without the Veteran s Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition.

5.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  East Orange VAMC seeks to attain consistency in use of one style of hospital bed system  equipment. If a new style of equipment was brought into the facility additional training to teach personnel how to use it would be needed. Confusion could cause a safety issue and it is best to continue the standard equipment from one source with the same type operation versus trying to learn multiple operations. In addition, the time required for training VA personnel on a different bed system will not be necessary. This results in a cost savings from not having productivity/time expended on additional training.

Access to the project area will be from the above mentioned roads.  All access into the project will be by existing two track roads or by foot; foot travel lengths would be less than 0.50 miles to the outlying portions of the project area, with the majority under 0.25 miles. Cross country routes by designation only.

<p><br />CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p><br />NMCARS<br />NMCARS 5237.102-90 Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA)<br />The contractor shall report contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth via a secure data collection site.

<p><br />CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p><br />NMCARS<br />NMCARS 5237.102-90 Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA)<br />The contractor shall report contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth via a secure data collection site.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.</p>

<p>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.</p>

<p>(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The <br />Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>

<p><br />CONTRACTOR INFORMATION<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p><br />NMCARS<br />NMCARS 5237.102-90 Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA)<br />The contractor shall report contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth via a secure data collection site.

Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.

With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

<SUBJECT>Lionheart FX Automated Microscope

<RESPDATE>082918
<CONTACT>William T. Brannen, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882084, Email vwl0@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to BioTek Instruments, Inc. for Automated microscope (Lionheart FX). The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum can grow in cell culture, which has replaced in vivo animal models for the assessment of disinfection strategies and primary evaluation of potential antiparasitic drug therapy. Because parasite amplification in culture is limited, we require sensitive microscopical assays to detect relatively small increases in parasite numbers to determine loss of infectivity or reductions in parasite growth following treatments. Our existing Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope system (partially automated) is not compatible with Windows 10 and certain hardware components are no longer supported by Zeiss microscopy. A major failure in any component will require replacement of the system at an expense comparable to the Lionheart FX cost. A replacement system compatible with the ITSO standardized Windows 10 platform with network support is needed.<br />The Lionheart FX augmented microscope is unique in that it works with a variety of microscope slides and culture chambers with both fixed and stained specimens as well as with live cell cultures in an enclosed humidity and CO2-controlled system that allows visualization and measurement of intracellular infection and drug kinetics in real-time over several days. There are other systems that allow time- lapse detection; however, the BioTek system has higher magnification (to 100x objective, oil immersion) and adjustable CO2 control to support different cell types, as well as injection ports for controlled parasite inoculum and drug treatment.<br />Together, these capabilities allow for studying disinfection and antiparasitic drug<br />activity in different cell types that serve as hosts for the parasite and better examine efforts to eliminate the parasite from those cells. Moreover, the Lionheart FX can serve as a platform for automated enumeration of parasite growth following immunofluorescence antibody labeling.<br />Important features of the The BioTek Lionheart FX system that will advance our research studies include: it works with 6- to 1536-well microplates, cell culture dishes and flasks, chamber slides and counting chambers; includes fluorescence, brightfield, color brightfield and phase contrast imaging capability; includes 6- position objective turret; has 4 filter cube capacity from a selection of more than 15 color sets available; has 1.25x to 100x air and oil immersion objectives available; has high resolution lead screw driven stage with open access; includes image-based and laser autofocus; includes basic cell image analysis software with available advanced image analysis options; has available environmental control cover for light tight imaging; incubation to 40&deg;C, and gas control capability; has available humidity &amp; gas control chamber with rapid gas recharge; has available CO2/O2 control module; has available dual reagent injector module; is an integrated system with very small footprint.<br />The Lionheart FX automated microscope is essential to our research needs. No other microscope will suffice.
<p>This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within five (5) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to William Brannen at vwl0@cdc.gov by 2:00 P.M. EST, August 29, 2018.</p>

Registered in the SAM database means that

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 

  (2)  The Contractors CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 

  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record Active.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.

(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or

    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.<BR><BR>(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.
