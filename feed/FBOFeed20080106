<DESC>The Education for Income Generation and Conflict Mitigation in Nepal program is designed to respond to a root cause of conflict?exclusion of disadvantaged youth from relevant education, training and employment opportunities. This multifaceted program will combine literacy and life skills education; technical and vocational training linked to employment; training to increase agricultural productivity and raise rural incomes; and targeted scholarships for disadvantaged youth (e.g., internally displaced persons, low caste groups, ethnic minorities and girls) to increase access to primary, secondary and higher level (10+2 and college certificate level) education. A cross-cutting theme throughout all of these activities will be the provision of peace and reconciliation education for all participants in order to develop the knowledge, attitudes and skills for conflict resolution, peace building, and the promotion of human rights. The primary beneficiaries of this program will initially be disadvantaged, conflict-affected and internally displaced youth throughout mid-western Nepal. However, if Washington approves, the Mission intends to expand the number of target beneficiaries of this program to include former Maoist combatants. This is a five-year activity, including three base years and two option years, with an estimated budget of $12-$16 million.

Problem Statement:

This reporting tool also has limits for creating complex financial reports to meet the reporting needs from the Financial Division (Cf), Case management Division (Cm) and Claims Division (Ca).  The results of these limitations are that users have to input repetitive manual entries to build spreadsheet reports.  

	Ci needs to have reporting tools that overcomes the shortcomings of these problems to support the organization needs.  Ci must also provide an intuitive and easy to use ad-hoc reporting tool for the End Users.  Reporting tools that create complex financial reports will avoid repetitive manual entries while building spreadsheet reports that meet the various division?s need.

High Level Requirements:
The recommended/proposed tool should be installed on an IIS server and be accessible by all users.  The tools should be integrated with the Active Directory in order to validate users.  The tool should connect to the NPFC database and create complex reports that meet certain specifications required by the NPFC divisions.  The tool design should be intuitive and with an easy to use data connection to the NPFC database for the end users to create ad-hoc reports.

Specific Requirement List:
	The contractor will provide the following:

    -Install the software on a predetermined computer
    -A software tool set that provides content generation, management and distribution for third party open server reports. The tool should provide viewer versioning, user management, archiving and other server-based functionality.  In addition, clustering, and failover functionality, should be part of the tool.  The tool should include a Management Console, an Access Portal, and server integration technology. 
    -The Management console should be a web-based administration tool that enables server management from any web-enabled desktop or device. The tool should supports remote administration through enterprise firewalls, including administration of an server hosted by an Application Service Provider (ASP).
    -The Access Portal should provide users with a fully functioning report and management environment for reports.  Users should be able to personalize their experience within the Access Portal while accessing stored reports, executing on demand reports or scheduling new jobs.
    -The tool should integrate with J2EE and .NET (dotnet) allowing developers to use industry-standard web editors to integrate and customize the interfaces to align with a web site?s look and feel.
    -The tool should provide views of data consolidated from multiple data sources and described them in a plain business language for easy reporting, query and analysis. These views should form a common meta layer that is easily accessed by any other product including web reports, dashboards, ad hoc queries, and server-based spreadsheets.
    -The tool should provide access to any data source to create reports and spreadsheets, enabling information delivery from anywhere, to anyone.  In addition, provide access to specialized data connectors for sources such as: PeopleSoft, SQL, Oracle DB, ODBC, MS SQL Server and XML.
    -The toll should provide ?open security directory? integration to leverage existing user administration services, such as LDAP or Active Directory services, to control user access to reporting content.

    -The tool should provide a server option with the ability to generate and schedule generation of reports.  In addition, enable developers and power users to create, distribute, and maintain interactive, content-rich reports rapidly and easily. The option should appear as Web pages on our Web site, integrating seamlessly and adopting its native look-and-feel. It should be easy to deploy allowing users to access personalized data without having to undergo training or download special software.
    -The tool should enable application developers and report developers to build dynamic, interactive enterprise reports ready for deployment to end users and create composite report design templates for BusinessReports. It should be based on open source code 
    -Provide training on how to use the reporting tools
