<DESC>Arnold Air Force Base (AEDC), Tennessee, has a requirement for the upgrade of six large Allis Chalmers 6.9kv 2 pole synchronous motors and one spare rotor for the Von Karman Facility.  The existing equipment consists of one 12,500 hp, five 16,000 hp motors, and one spare 16,000 hp rotor.  The motors shall all be upgraded to 18,500 hp with a 1.25 service factor and each motor shall receive a new nameplate validating the upgrade.  This project includes a detailed design for the motor upgrades.  Due to the lack of sufficient detailed drawings of the motors, reverse engineering shall be required.  The design of all the motors shall be the same allowing interchangeability of any motor or the installation of the spare rotor into any motor.  Disassembly of the motors involves asbestos and lead paint abatement.  It is intended that this work be performed at the Contractor's repair facility.  The Contractor must have the in house capability to perform a dynamic rotor balance at 3600 RPM for motors of this size or greater.  The Government intends to award a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity single award contract.  Request for Proposal (RFP) with the complete specification will be available on or about 19 March 2008.  The RFP and specification will only be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website.  Please register as a source to be notified of RFP amendments, etc.  It is the responsibility of the vendor (even those registered as a source) to check the FBO website frequently to ensure they have all the available information.

HOWEVER, each technical package must also include any modifications to any component for the JTE system.  Vendor technical packages without the relevant JTE modifications are not acceptable.  

If any responding contractor has the ability to produce only a portion of the technical data package identified above, they must clearly identify the specific portion and provide rationale as to how they would assure integration into JTE system technical data (as identified in Section 13 TEU System and Subsystems).  Since MTC Technologies Incorporated is the prime contractor for the JTE system under delivery order F09603-01-D-0209-QP05 (with Northrop Grumman Amherst Systems (NGAS) as a primary sub contractor), and since the Government does not posses JTE system level technical data (identified in Section 13), a responding contractor must clearly identify how they have interfaced with MTC or NGAS to assure they can independently meet the integration requirement for the portion of technical data they claim to be able to deliver.  Any contractor who responds to this sources sought synopsis must also clearly identify how their delivery will comply with any modifications (to each specific component) that may have been made for the delivered JTE system.         

Only a firm-fixed-price pricing arrangement will be considered.  Each interested entity that has the capability to meet the requirements identified above hereby has the opportunity to provide supporting rationale that they can meet the identified requirements

<DESC><p>Title: Genetic Predisposition to Allergic Contact Dermatitis
<p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Toxicology and Molecular Biology Branch (TMBB), Morgantown, West Virginia hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to the Trustees of Dartmouth College for the following services:</p>
<p>Recently, we have established a contract with Case Western University to study genetic risk factors in allergic contact dermatitis. In genetic association studies, large sample size is necessary to detect significant associations with sufficient statistical power. Therefore, another participating site is needed to increase sample size and reduce the length of the recruitment period. The second site needs to follow the same criteria in patch testing (same screening panel) and contact dermatitis assessment.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to The Trustees of Dartmouth College under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, CDC, NIOSH, 1065 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505 or e-mail RMULLENAX@CDC.GOV or Fax to 304-285-6083. Please reference # 000HCCCB-2008-59544; all vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determines if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with The Trustees of Dartmouth College, One Hinman Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH 03755-4099 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Respiratory Disease Studies, Field Sutdies Branch, Morgantown, West Virginia hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Associates of Cape Cod, Inc. for the following supplies:
<p>The purpose of this request is the procurement of purchase of Glucatell Kinetic Assay Kits (for glucan assay), and Chromo-Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) reagent, Glucashield buffer, and endotoxin free water (for endotoxin assay) to quantify glucan and endotoxin in floor dust samples collected within the scope of a NIOSH public school study at Bridgeport, CT.</p>
<p>"Glucatell" is a biological assay kit to quantify glucans in samples. Using these assay kits, we are able to analyze glucan levels in 130 floor dust samples and 210 air samples collected from the public school study at an Environmental Microbiology Laboratory at NIOSH.</p>
<p>"Chromo-LAL" is co-lyophilized Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) and substrate agent for endotoxin assay. Commercially available endotoxin assay kit is very expensive and usually interfered by glucan in samples. NIOSH is using the KLARE (Kinetic Limulus Assay with resistant parallel line estimation) method for endotoxin assay which was developed by Dr. Donald Milton at Harvard School of Public Health and does not require purchasing whole assay kit. With the KLARE method, we can purchase the Lysate separately. Associate Cape Cod (ACC) is the only manufacturer which sells Lysate only. The Chromo-LAL for endotoxin assay, in addition, should be purchased along with Glucashield buffer which blocks glucan pathways to eliminate interference by glucan. This is critical to get endotoxin-specific assay results. Endotoxin free water (LRW) is also required for the assay, and ACC provides this product.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Associates of Cape Cod, Inc.under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, CDC, NIOSH, 1065 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505 or e-mail RMULLENAX@CDC.GOV or Fax to 304-285-6083. Please reference # 000HCCHB-2008-61006; all vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determines if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with The ASSOCIATES OF Cape Cod, Inc. 124 Bernard Saint Jean Road, East Falmouth, MA 02536-4445 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedure (dollar threshold of $100,000), for expert services from the American Academy of Family Physician, PO Box 11210, Shawnee Mission, KS 66207-1210.  Under the authority of FAR 6.301-1 10 U.S.C. 2304 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.  The purpose of this request is to procure expert services from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) to provide education and outreach expertise as it relates to the implementation of physician quality measures used in CMS’ pay for reporting and Value Based Purchasing (VBP) programs.  Membership in AAFP is comprised of primary care and subspecialty physicians who provide comprehensive care to millions of Medicare patients.  CMS will identify opportunities to align its education and outreach priorities with educational activities of this medical specialty society to facilitate an efficient, national strategy for educating primary care physicians and their staff in implementing physician performance measures used in the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI).  The AAFP has been identified as a recognized national organization which is actively taking a leadership role within the AQA and NQF and which can provide a comprehensive approach to education and outreach efforts to engage primary care physicians in quality measurement and participation in CMS PQRI.
AAFP –Representing more than 94,000 family physicians and medical students nationwide, the Academy maintains a variety of quality improvement tools and resources to assist physicians and medical students in implementing quality improvement projects and practice re-design.  These tools include: The Practice Enhancement Forum, a quality improvement initiative developed to improve patient care by providing family physicians and their office staffs with education and hands-on assistance with QI, office redesign and implementation of the Chronic Care Model (CCM), offered at the AAFP constituent chapter level in cooperation with local QI experts; METRIC (Measuring, Evaluating and Translating Research Into Care), an online practice improvement program that allows family physicians to earn CME credit in their office for improving patient care and to fulfill the maintenance of board certification requirements, TransforMED, a practice redesign support service to assist family physicians to implement a medical home concept. CMS has a need to improve physician understanding and participation in PQRI.  The majority of PQRI measures address critical aspects of care provided to millions of Medicare beneficiaries by primary care physicians. CMS is committed to initiating a national strategy for primary care physician in PQRI.  In 2007 only 16% of eligible professionals participated in PQRI.  CMS goal for 2008 is to increase participation by 50%.  In order to reach this goal, it is critical for CMS to reach out to physician specialty groups and charge them with educating their membership about the benefits of participating in PQRI.  Leveraging CMS’ national outreach efforts to take advantage of established specialty society activities at the chapter-level will promote faster, more efficient education and understanding about effective implementation of PQRI performance measures.  Establishing a collaborative effort with medical specialty societies will support and advance public accountability, quality improvement, increased patient safety and value-based purchasing and will enhance the care of Medicare beneficiaries.  AAFP has broad participation from all parts of the healthcare system, through national, regional, state, and local chapters representing, physicians, medical students and their practice managers.  All responsible sources may submit capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency in accordance with the requirements in the synopsis.  The period of performance is 6 months from the date of award.  NAICS CODE IS  541990.

<CONTACT>Dominique H Malone, Phone (301) 827-7227, Email dominique.malone@fda.hhs.gov - Patricia M Pemberton, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-827-1022, Fax 301-827-7106, Email patricia.pemberton@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The FDA intents to issue and RFP to provide Population-based data to answer questions of public health importance regarding biological products. The threat of a swine influenza pandemic in 1976-77 led to a mass vaccination effort in the United States. Unfortunately, the vaccine was subsequently found to cause rare cases of Guillain Barr Syndrome (GBS), a severe paralyzing neurologic condition. For any future large-scale influenza immunization campaign, it is important that the government be well prepared to detect a problem that occurred once before, and the public would expect no less. Although clinical pre-licensure studies may identify potential adverse events associated with a biologic product, rare adverse events associated with the biologic product will likely go unrecognized until there is widespread use of the biologic product in the population. The timely identification of serious rare adverse events is important for at least three reasons. First, the morbidity to the individual may be severe, representing an important safety issue. Second, unwarranted fear of adverse reactions can lead to a lack of confidence in, and inappropriately low use of, the biologic product such as a vaccine. Third, new and timely information that quantifies the incidence of serious vaccine adverse effects, if any, can facilitate benefit-risk analysis of continued use of the biologic product. The objective of this requirement is to development of large rapid systems for monitoring adverse events associated with a biologic product is important, and increasing this capacity currently for existing biologic products can help prepare for a biologic threat such as influenza pandemic that would require mass immunizations. This project would further enhance the ability of FDA to conduct biologic safety and effectiveness among large diverse populations, with respect to severe but uncommon adverse events. This requirements goal is to gain access to data resources that promote the Division Epidemiologys mission to assure the safety and effectiveness of biologic products. This project builds upon and expands on activities undertaken as part of previous FDA collaborative studies for biologic product safety, including evaluating adverse events after influenza vaccination among the elderly using Medicare data. During the course of the contract period of performance, the Contractor shall provide a work plan(s) and a cost estimate(s) for each specific biologic safety study requested. The Contractor will be required to:1) Analytic datasets and associated documentation (per terms of contract). 
2) Medical record review and abstraction (necessity to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Note-not to be delivered to FDA directly). 
3) Physician and/or Patient Survey (necessity to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis). 
4) Work closely with FDA to develop feasibility studies (frequencies to be determined by FDAs identification of a biologic safety and/or effectiveness issue). 
5) Work closely with FDA in the development of a detailed protocol for a formal pharmacoepidemiolgic study.
The contract performance will be in the Washington DC/Maryland area. An indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract is anticipated, for five(5)years. This is a new requirement.
FDA intends to solicit this requirement as “Full and Open” competitive requirement. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). FDA anticipates release of the RFP on or around August 1, 2008 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before September 20, 2008.

<DESC>This contract is intended to provide for watershed protection and restoration by stabilizing active erosion in meadows and small drainages. Work required to stabilize these areas includes reshaping vertical banks to allow vegetative recovery, and machine placement of rock in drainages to prevent additional scour from seasonal flows. Specific work items include excavation in meadows often requiring conservation of topsoil, and preserving and re-planting living sod of perennial grasses. Excavation will also take place in steep and eroded ephemeral channels and existing gullies requiring trenching and mechanical placement of rocks and boulders. Work will also entail placement of erosion control blanket and rolled erosion control products to enhance vegetation establishment and survivability on slopes and in channels. Erosion control design requirements may include below grade placement of geotextile products as a permeable separator/stabilizer, to prevent piping of soil beneath new or existing structures. Erosion control products and geotextile materials will be provided by the government.   This contract will also provide for watershed protection through the repair of roads, to improve drainage function, including outsloping.. Work under this contract will include measures that restore hillslope hydrologic function by removing drainage structures, ripping compacted areas, and recontouring as needed. Equipment rental with operator and miscellaneous labor is provided for in this contract to perform work within this scope in order to adapt repairs or improvements to deal with variations in site conditions or unique design requirements.  Also anticipated for the loading and haul of materials (e.g. rocks and boulders) from designated areas to the project work site. No unique or specialized equipment is required to perform work under this contract. However, equipment size, weight and capacity will be specified because of the hydrologic and ecological sensitivity of the work areas. Work will be performed primarily by the hour and directed by the Forest Service. 
All work to be performed is on the San Bernardino National Forest.  The resulting contract will be a three year IDIQ contract with 3-5 awards.  The solicitation when it is available on or about July 25, 2008 on this FEDBIXOPPS site will be advertised as a commercial item under FAR Part 12 procedures.  Contractors will be required to list their equipment such as dozers, excavators, and dump trucks by type and size along with any attachments or special features the equipment has.  This will be a 100% HUB Zone Set-aside with a cascading feature so that if at least three well-qualified HUB Zone contractors with fair and reasonable prices cannot be selected, then Small Businesses that are not HUB Zone may be considered.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Process Measurements Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Perkin Elmer LAS, Inc., to replace the electronic components on a Perkin Elmer System 2000 Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometer.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently utilizes a Perkin Elmer System 2000 Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometer.  A recent surge in the line power damaged the electronics of this equipment.  This instrument cannot be operated without replacing the damaged components.  The electronics are proprietary products and unique to this spectrometer.  There are no “off-the-shelf” equivalents, and Perkin Elmer is the only supplier of the replacement parts for this instrument.  Therefore, the electronics must be 100 percent compatible with the existing instrument.  Perkin Elmer LAS, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the electronics that is required to satisfy the Government’s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by August 4, 2008, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) anticipates awarding a contract(s) to an organization or organizations to provide analytical laboratory services for analysis of environmental samples for the National Children's Study (NCS).  The anticipated contract type will be fixed unit price with a five to seven year period of performance, including options for additional quantities. Further details will be provided in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to be issued approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the publication of this announcement.  This announcement is intended to inform interested offerors of a planned RFP, of important background information, and of some key requirements essential for responding to the RFP.

Background information on the Study is available on the NCS web site www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.  The Study is a large, long-term longitudinal study of broadly defined environmental influences on child health and development.  The Study's goal is to better understand how these environmental exposures and genetic factors interact to affect children's health and development.  It will explore the effects of a broad range of environmental factors, including biological, chemical, physical, and psychosocial environmental influences.  Gene expression and gene-environment interaction will be important aspects of the Study.  The broad range of outcomes includes but is not limited to: obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and mental health issues.  The Study will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children from throughout the country beginning with early pregnancy or even prior to conception  and following each child for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and environmental exposures until at least 21 years of age. 

Biological specimens and environmental samples will be collected throughout the Study. This procurement pertains only to environmental samples (air, water, soil, dust). They are considered precious national resources such that their handling, security, analysis and storage must be subject to the most stringent requirements to preserve their source, identity, quality, and integrity. To the extent that these samples are stable, many will be stored in a repository for an indefinite period of time. However, some environmental samples will require analysis after collection because of either analyte instability or research findings which suggest a need for analysis, such as for a case control study.  This procurement pertains to the environmental samples that require immediate analysis (generally within 14 to 30 days from sample collection).  These samples will be collected from households and perhaps other locations periodically throughout the NCS.  Environmental samples to be analyzed as part of this acquisition include particulate matter and gaseous air pollutants collected onto filters and passive samplers, dust wipes, and tap water. The classes of environmental analytes being considered for analysis in this acquisition include, but are not limited to: carbonyls, haloacetic acids, air oxidants, particulate matter, pyrethroids, and volatile organic compounds. Analytes which may be requested in the future in vacuumed dust, dust wipes, and soil include allergens, elemental carbon, endotoxins, metals, mold, semi-volatile organic compounds, and others; though these analytes are not part of the current acquisition.  More detail about the design and methods for the NCS can be found in the Research Plan on the NCS web site www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov 

The environmental laboratory(ies) shall perform the following tasks:  (1) receive, secure, analyze, and report all NCS samples sent to them; (2) maintain samples and records in appropriate secure storage facilities that will retain their identity, integrity and quality (until results have been reported and QA/QC deemed appropriate); (3) package and ship some residual environmental samples and processed samples for repository storage and subsequent additional analysis; (4) develop and maintain a quality assurance program for all laboratory operations including personnel management, and sample receipt, analysis, shipment and storage according to all Federal, State, and local regulations; (5) maintain an automated electronic tracking system to receive, inventory, process, and track samples, a system that is compatible with the NCS Information Management System; and (6) provide electronic data transfer in accord with EPA Staged Electronic Data Deliverable (SEDD), Draft Revision 5.1 format.

Offerors are required to perform all analyses at the laboratory facility(ies) itemized in their proposal. It is preferable that the primary contractor perform as many analyses as possible, in as few locations as possible, for logistic and cost factors. However, given the large quantity of analyses, particularly in the later years of the contract, teaming or use of subcontractors is a possibility.  Redundancy within the organization will be viewed as a benefit to ensure capability to analyze the samples according to schedule.

To serve as an environmental analytical laboratory for the Study, interested offerors must have:
i.	Experience managing large environmental sample analysis projects.
ii.	 Experience in receiving, processing, analyzing, and storing, environmental samples such as air sampling filters and passive samplers, water, and household dust wipes,.
iii.	Laboratory accreditation by the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP), the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Laboratory Accreditation Program, or the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program or equivalent for each proposed laboratory facility (specific physical location/address) for at least two years prior to the contract start date.
iv.	Laboratory facilities must be located within the 48 contiguous United States. 

The RFP is anticipated to be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) website:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov, through the NICHD website:  http://www.nichd.nih.gov/funding/grantcontract/, and the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts website:  http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/index.html   approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the date of the publication of this announcement. The due date for submission of proposals in response to the RFP is anticipated to be on or about October 7, 2008.  Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this pre-solicitation announcement.  This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541380.  Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted in writing to Lisa Coleman, Contracting Officer, at lc301t@nih.gov or Elizabeth Osinski, Contracting Officer, at eo43m@nih.gov or addressed to, NICHD Contracts Management Branch, Office of Acquisitions, NIDDK, NIH, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Room 7A-07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (if hand-delivered or sending by delivery service--6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A-07, Rockville, Maryland 20852).  No collect calls will be accepted.  This is not an RFP and this announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  The reference number to be used for this announcement is:  NIH-NICHD-NCS-09-09.  All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Applera Corporation, DBA Applied Biosystems Group, Applied Biosystems Division, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA94404-1128, for the acquisition of a performance (maintenance service) agreement for a specific ABI Prism 3730XL DNA Analyzer.  Applied Biosystems has exclusive copyrights, licensing agreements, patents, and/or trade secret ownership and therefore the only vendor that can satisfy the requirement.  In order to ensure correct instrument operation, the circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) "only one source reasonably available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to demonstrate the contractor's ability to provide maintenance of the instrument and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability, no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Submit your response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Barbara L. Mattison (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, Durham, NC 27711; by fax (919)541-4273; or, by e-mail at:  Mattison.Barbara@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 519120 Libraries and Archives with a size standard of $6,500,000.00.. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the Dialog Proquest Corporation of Cary, NC for a literature searching service with one year of subscription access, plus 2 option years, to Dialog's databases.
The U.S. EPA believes that the Dialog Proquest Corporation is the only source capable of providing this database access. The EPA library staff needs access to a collection of databases covering scientific, technical, business, news, regulatory and general interest information. The service must offer selective field searching across one of more of those databases simultaneously using a specialized command language that allows the librarian to produce records that are targeted to the specific research and discovery needs of Agency scientists, policy-makers and managers. This service must also provide links to full-text articles and allow for tagged output for use in post-processing software. 
Since this procurement is being considered a commercial service, simplified procurement procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 13.5. The base period of performance is expected to be from October 01, 2008 through September 30, 2009. All interested parties who believe that they can provide these required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.
The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any other sources exist and, therefore, no Request For Quote (RFQ) is available at this time unless the interested party provides the aforementioned information. Consequently, any responses that fail to provide the aforementioned information and instead just request a copy of the RFQ, will not be honored. Submittals should be made to Dan Neustedter (919-541-4749) via e-mail at neustedter.dan@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to issue a competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ) in accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13, to conduct an evaluation of Remote Infrared Audible Signage (RIAS) Model Accessibility Project (MAP).  The evaluation will address the following effects of the RIAS deployment: (1) Effect on multimodal accessibility in public transportation with regard to persons with visual, cognitive, or learning disabilities; (2) Effect on public transportation operators and their customers; (3) Effect on making public transportation accessible to persons with visual, cognitive, or learning disabilities, who use public transit and paratransit; and (4) Effect on education, community integration, work life and general quality of life of the targeted populations.  To address the evaluation questions, the Volpe Center will conduct a panel study.  Pre and post surveys will be administered to a panel of study participants who use the technology during the course of their usual travels for a period of 6 to 8 weeks.  The surveys will be designed to assess the participants experience with the technology and to determine the effects on multimodal accessibility.  The Volpe Center seeks sources that would be able to provide support in surveying a panel of study participants with visual, cognitive, or learning disabilities.  The survey firm will administer a pre-survey (by telephone) to the panel prior to their use of the technology.  Following a 6-8 week period where study participants use the technology, the survey firm will administer a post-telephone survey.  Among study participants with cognitive disabilities, qualitative in-person interviews may need to be conducted in place of the typical survey format, as this population may have difficulty completing a survey.  A complete statement of work will be set forth in the Request for Quotation (RFQ).  RFQ issuance will be on or about August 4, 2008.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541990 and the small business size standard is $6.5M.  Interested firms must submit a written capability statement to the above named point of contact providing clear and convincing evidence of the firm's capability to provide the required services.  Written capability statements must be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Responses received after fifteen (15) calendar days or without the required documentation will be considered non-responsive and will not be considered.  The Government will not pay for any documentation provided in response to this synopsis and documentation received will not be returned to the sender.  Telephone calls made in place of the required documentation will not be accepted.  The URL of the Volpe Center Acquisition Management Division home page is: http://www.volpe.dot.gov/procure/index.html.  NOTE: All contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive award from a DOT Agency.

<DESC>THIS IS AN INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT PURSUANT TO FAR 6.302-1.  THIS CONSTITUTES THE ONLY WRITTEN NOTICE.  NO OTHER NOTICE OR SOLICITATION SHALL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE.  

The U. S. Census Bureau is the primary source of basic statistics about the population and economy of the Nation.  These statistics assist the Congress, the executive branch of the Federal Government, state and local governments, the general public, and the private sector in the development and evaluation of social and economic activities.  Our major programs are the periodic censuses, current surveys, and a wide range of reimbursable work for other agencies.  The programs cover a broad spectrum of demographic and economic statistics. 

The Governments Division (GOVS) provides for the collection, review, tabulation, and dissemination of financial statistics on nearly 90,000 state and local governments in the United States.  These data cover government revenues by type, expenditures by character and function, indebtedness, and cash and securities holdings.  These financial statistics are essential to calculations of key U.S. Government measures of national economic performance, viz., Gross Domestic Product and the Flow of Funds Accounts.  Other federal agencies, state and local legislators, researchers, businesses, and individuals also use these data.

The purpose of this contract is to obtain the services of a contractor who will provide expert advice and assistance required by the Governments Division (GOVS) to complete the resurrection of the Annual Survey of Federal Government Finances (Federal Comp) and develop statistics for some of the missing years from the time series between 1995 when it was discontinued and 2007 when it was started again.  This includes the research, data collection, compilation, classification, data review, and written analysis of financial data for the federal government.  By contracting this year we will be able to provide government financial statistics for all levels of government (Federal, state, and local) on a corresponding basis for comparison and analysis and be able to go back into the time series to provide for some of the missing data series.  This will complete a previously missing component to our measures of government finances.

For Local Government Finances, the work will include completing the research and compilation of financial statements to increase the response rates for the 2007 Census of Governments Finance Phase. 

For the survey year 2007, OMB granted a one-year exception to the 2005 - 2007 clearance package to allow for a one-time collection of data on Defined Contribution and Healthcare Plans offered by state administered public employee retirement systems.  OMB recently granted approval to extend and expand the collection of data from public-employee retirement systems by allowing the continuation of the collection from state administered systems and extending the collection to all locally administered retirement systems with assets in excess of $5 billion.  The purpose of this phase of this contract is to obtain the expert experience and service required by Governments Division to update the 2007 Government Finance and Employment Classification Manual to include the statistical classification categories and definitions that are applicable to the additional collection of Defined Contribution and Healthcare Plan data.  The Classification Manual was updated in 2006 and every effort is being made to keep it current and complete.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) intends to award a new contract to link and package 30mm PGU-15/B Target Practice (TP) ammunition currently held as Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) 30mm PGU-15/B TP assets.  MARCORSYSCOM will issue a competitive solicitation resulting in a three (3) year IDIQ, firm fixed price contract award.  The PGU-15/B TP cartridge is used on the MK-44, 30mm Gun System that is currently on the EFV.  The Program Manager Advanced Amphibious Assault (PM AAA) owns PGU-15/B cartridges, but they are in the Air Forces configuration (NSN 1305-01-093-3338) and are unlinked.  PM AAA has a requirement to reconfigure these rounds for use in the EFVs Gun System.  The contractor will be required to procure MK-15 ammunition links, M592 metal cans, foam inserts and associated packaging material required to package this ammunition in accordance with Automated Data List (ADL) 53711-7624864, required for Navy and Marine Corps 30mm ammunition.  Government owned ammunition, currently packaged in a configuration useable only for A-10 aircraft, will be provided to the manufacturer as Government Furnished Material (GFM).  The contractor will be required to de-tube the ammunition (as it comes in the Air Forces A-10 packaging configuration), inspect the ammunition to ensure serviceability, and then place the ammunition into MK-15 links.  The linked ammunition will then be placed in the foam protective cushioning and then into a M592 metal can (two 15-round belts will be placed into each can).  The 30-round packed configuration will be palletized in accordance with ADL 53711-7624864.  The contractor will be authorized to use the standard 40 x 48 wooden pallet rather than the MK3 metal pallet to reduce the cost of this project.  The applicable National Stock Number (NSN) for the reconfigured ammunition to be delivered is 1305-01-525-8642, Ctg, 30mm PGU-15/B Linked, DODIC AA94.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate by full and open competition under authority of FAR Part 15.  This notice expires 3 August 2008, and is not a request for competitive proposals.  A solicitation for this requirement will be issued through NECO.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued 4 August 2008.  Written questions will be taken once the solicitation is issued.  No questions will be accepted before that time or in response to this notice.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Developmentof a Electrical Power Distribution Asset Condition AssessmentDescription: Condition Assessment of LaRCs Electrical Power Distribution System includingdevelopment of a Capital Investment Plan for near term and long range systemimprovements.  NASA LaRC   is seeking information on offerors capabilities and experiencein performing Electrical Power Distribution Asset Condition Assessments on installationssimilar in size and complexity to NASA LaRC. Background:NASA LaRC is one of NASA's 14 centers across the US.  Its mission is to conduct cuttingedge aerospace and aeronautic research and development for the agency.	NASA LaRC wasfounded in 1917 and consists of over 200 facilities including world class wind tunnels onan 800 acre campus in Hampton, VA.  Being the first of the NASA centers, it has a matureinfrastructure, which includes a complex electrical distribution system with manycomponents that have been in service for over 40 years.The scope of a future LaRC  assessment would accomplish the following goals; 1) assessthe condition/reliability of all electrical distribution equipment and recommend actionsto replace, repair, refurbish, etc., 2) assess the electrical distribution systemconfiguration for weaknesses in system topology compared to current industry designpractices, 3) assess current protective device schemes and operational practices foradequacy and recommended improvements, 4) assess the need for and identify the possiblebenefits of the use of a SCADA or centralized control and data collection system, 5)identify current technologies that should be considered for future system improvements toaddress current industry best practices, recent code changes, safety, and operational andmaintenance improvements (i.e. GIS equipment), 6) assess the condition of NASA LaRC'sStratton and Back River Substations for adequacy and recommend required and beneficialimprovements, 7) assess NASA LaRC's list of currently planned electrical system projectsand in-house system condition assessments for adequacy and alignment with the independentelectrical distribution system assessments, 8) identify current practices in place atNASA LaRC that are robust and should be maintained or continued (i.e. possibly the use ofPILC cable for underground distribution feeders), and 9) document the results of theindependent assessment for use as a 10 year master plan for electrical systemimprovements at NASA LaRC.In addition, specific work elements should be included in a comprehensive ConditionAssessment including:1. Development of the methodology for the Asset Condition Assessment.2. Identification of all the electrical assets that need to be included in the assessmentfrom the connection to the local utility to the unit substations feeding each buildingand major HV distribution equipment in major facilities.3. Development of long term asset degradation and end-of-life criteria used to evaluatethe condition of each asset.4.

MEMORANDUM FOR CONTRACTORS	                   			


SUBJECT:  Request for Information (RFI) for NGA Interpreting Services in the greater Washington, D.C. and/or greater St. Louis, MO areas



1.  INTRODUCTION

It is the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency’s (NGA’s) intention to acquire Interpreting Service support for the NGA Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HH) Community located in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area and/or the greater St. Louis, MO area starting in the second quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2009.  The period of performance will be one year from date of award.  The contract will have four additional one-year optional periods of performance.  The Government reserves the right to award one or more contracts, an IDIQ contract, and/or a hybrid type contract whichever is determined to provide the best support for the NGA’s D/HH Community.  

2.  PURPOSE

This document serves as the RFI of the contractor community.  Responses to this RFI will be assessed to identify sources that are considered best qualified to meet future requirements.  Best qualified sources are those sources which demonstrate the greatest depth and breadth of skills, experiences, and knowledge.  All potential offerors will be provided a copy of the Bidder’s List and invited to any scheduled Bidder’s Conferences.  Teaming is encouraged.  It is not NGA’s intent to preclude companies that express an interest; rather the Bidder’s list will enhance teaming opportunities.  The government intends to issue a draft request for proposal (RFP) after reviewing responses to this RFI.

3.   BACKGROUND

NGA has a significant community of D/HH employees who are vital to supporting the NGA mission.  These employees rely on varying degrees of interpretation support.  Potential offerors should be prepared to propose personnel with the following qualifications:
1.  Personnel must either have Top Secret/SCI clearances or be clearable.
2.  Personnel must have fluency in various modes of sign language and be able to adequately interpret and transliterate between American Sign Language (ASL)/other modes of sign language and English.
3.  Personnel who are willing to travel as there is expected to be some CONUS and OCONUS travel.

NOTE:  NGA is considering the implementation of a Small Business Security Clearance Pilot Program if applicable.  The emphasis is to allow small businesses the opportunity to propose on NGA solicitations at a Top Secret clearance level and provide a limited number of pre-award NGA clearance sponsorship to companies determined to be a viable sources based on their response to this RFI.   This Pilot Program is to assist small business personnel in obtaining a NGA TS/SCI Security Clearance within an approximate 90-day timeframe, enabling cleared personnel to start work upon award or shortly thereafter.  Qualified small businesses must have the required capabilities and technology to support NGA’s interpreting services requirements.

The mission of NGA is to provide timely, relevant, and accurate geospatial intelligence in support of national security.  The mission of the offeror(s) selected for award of any contracts awarded as a result of any RFP subsequest to this RFI is to provide interpreting support to a vital group of NGA employees to facilitate their performance.  
  

4.  ANTICIPATED SCOPE OF WORK

Interpreting tasks are expected to include, but not be limited to, support in the St. Louis, MO area, Arnold, MO, Bethesda, MD, Reston, VA, Ft. Belvoir, VA, Washington, DC, as well as temporary duty assignment (TDY) and deployment assignments support as required.  In addition, the NGA will be relocating East Coast operations to New Campus East by Fort Belvoir between 2010 and 2012.  TDY support may be throughout the United States.  The RFP will include an option for OCONUS TDY travel and deployment assignments which may include hazardous war zone areas.  It is anticipated that a minimum of five (5) Full-time Interpreters and one (1) part-time Interpreter with TOP SECRET//SCI-cleared personnel for the Greater St. Louis, MO area and four (4) Full-time Interpreters and one (1) part-time Interpreter TOP SECRET//SCI-cleared personnel for the Greater Washington, D.C. area meeting the requirements of the SOW and possessing skills will be needed to fulfill NGA requirements.  Intermittent Interpreting support will also be required on an as-needed basis to supplement on-site interpreting support.  The draft SOW is attached. 

Optional effort- NGA has a requirement for TOP SECRET//SCI cleared personnel to provide Computer Aided Real-Time Transcription (CART) Services on a frequent, but intermittent basis for various meetings and trainings in the St. Louis, MO area.  Occasional CART services may be required in the Washington, DC area on a less frequent basis.

Mr. Jean Wiener of FoProBiM has a unique skill set and experience in interaction and information-gathering from the Navassa artisanal fishers, both on site and in the home villages in Southwest Haiti. He has performed similar services on two prior research cruises to Navassa and in an extensive ethnographic study of the Navassa fishing communities in Southwest Haiti. Mr. Weaver is the only known source with the qualifications, experience and expertise to provide the service. There are no other known researchers who have Mr. Weavers excellent rapport with the Navassa fishers. Mr. Wiener is also a certified SCUBA diver which allows him to contribute to other aspects of the cruise operations via in-water observation. The contractors will target coastal communities along the Southwestern tip of Haiti located between Les Cayes to the south and J&eacute;r&eacute;mie to the north, and specifically those with fishers frequenting Navassa Island. The contractor shall provide following tasks associated with this research and will be accomplished utilizing ethnographic field methods:
<p>&bull; as accurately as possible, determine the numbers of fishers from each community along the coast of the target area frequenting Navassa Island;<br />&bull; begin research on why fishers use certain types of gear (economics, habit, history, sustainability) and their locations in the target area (correlation between gear types and location);<br />&bull; provide a participant for the 2008 research cruise to Navassa Island to undertake interviews of fishers at the island and continue data collection on: numbers of fishers encountered, their home villages, fishing methods; and with the shipboard research team assist in the design of a method for collecting data from the fishers on their total catch at Navassa (before they leave the island for Haiti);</p>
<p>The anticipated performance period is date of award through December 31. 2009.</p>

<DESC><p>NATIONAL SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES IS SEEKING SOURCES WITH&nbsp;EXTENSIVE&nbsp;EXPERIENCE IN PROVIDING AVIATION CONSULTING. REQUEST ALL INTERESTED PARTIES SUBMIT AN EXPERIENCE/CAPABILITY STATEMENT WHICH PROVIDES SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO ENABLE A PRELIMINARY FUNCTIONAL EVALUATION.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Work plan</p>
<p>The Exhibit 300 document is a summary report that is based on a substantial amount of analysis and documentation. This analysis and documentation will be contained in a document entitled the Business Case Analysis.</p>
<p>The business case analysis contains the following sections:</p>
<p>- Introduction<br />- Mission(s)<br />&nbsp; o Legislative mandate(s)/Agency charter<br />&nbsp; o Primary and secondary missions<br />- Performance measures<br />- Requirements<br />&nbsp; o Payload, performance, etc.<br />&nbsp; o Number of aircraft<br />- Shortfalls and remaining useful life of fleet<br />- Baseline cost analysis<br />- Cost effectiveness<br />&nbsp; o Aircraft vs. alternate means<br />- Aircraft alternatives analysis (if appropriate)<br />&nbsp; o Solutions to shortfalls<br />&nbsp; o Replacement aircraft <br />&nbsp; o Additional aircraft <br />&nbsp; o Recommendations<br />- Acquisition alternatives analysis<br />&nbsp; o Acquisition/ownership alternatives<br />&nbsp; o Financial analysis<br />&nbsp; o Advantages/disadvantages<br />&nbsp; o Ranking and recommendations<br />- Summary</p>
<p>To accomplish this analysis we use the following approach:</p>
<p>The development of the analysis starts with an analysis of the legislation and agency directives that define the agency's primary aviation mission(s). In addition, the secondary missions are defined. When the missions have been defined the next step is to determine the high level performance measures that define success for the primary missions. As a minimum these should include measures for:<br />&nbsp; o&nbsp;Mission accomplishment<br />&nbsp; o Cost per mission<br />&nbsp; o Accident/incident rate<br />These should be established for each primary mission.</p>
<p>The requirements are based on an analysis of the needs presented by the users of these aircraft. The focus is on current and planned future applications and includes requirements for payload, range, speed, endurance, availability, reliability, target utilization, avionics, special equipment, turn-around time, response time, etc. This document takes the needs of the DOE users of these aircraft and translates them into detailed, specific requirements for each mission and type of aircraft that specify the minimum requirements that will meet the stated needs. An integral part of this analysis is the determination of the minimum number of aircraft needed to perform each mission.</p>
<p>The next step in the process is to focus on current and projected shortfalls of the current aircraft and their equipment to determine what alternatives are available to mitigate the shortfall(s). This includes an analysis of the projected useful life of the existing aircraft to determine if potential replacement aircraft need to be analyzed and included in the analysis. This forms the foundation for a long-term (20 years) fleet plan.</p>
<p>Next the baseline costs to operate the existing fleet of aircraft are established. This is a primary output for the Exhibit 300 and is also the baseline against which aircraft replacement or upgrade alternatives are measured.</p>
<p>In addition, a cost effectiveness analysis must be accomplished that shows that the use of aircraft is the most cost effective means of accomplishing the mission(s) assigned to these aircraft. <br /><br />There are no current plans to replace these aircraft. However, the fixed wing aircraft are over 25 years old and the helicopters are about 17 years old. Therefore, an analysis should be done to determine what the aging issues are that are associated with these aircraft, what modifications, SLEPs (if any) and avionics or other upgrades need to be included in the long term planning for these aircraft and to establish a long term replacement plan.</p>
<p>Once the preceding parts of the analysis are completed, a financial analysis will be accomplished to determine the projected operating budget as well as the acquisition budget for upgrades and/or new aircraft. This will include an analysis of the best method of acquisition and operation of the aircraft. <br /><br />&#61607; Exhibit 300 (E 300)</p>
<p>When the preceding documents have been prepared and approved, the Exhibit 300 for these aircraft will be completed in accordance with the applicable OMB Circular A-11 guidelines. We plan to provide two separate Ex 300 documents. One will be for the King Air 200 aircraft and one for the Bell 412 helicopters.</p>
<p>Deliverables</p>
<p>The deliverables for this project consist of the following:<br />1) Business Case Analysis <br />2) Exhibit 300 - Fixed wing missions<br />3) Exhibit 300 - Helicopter missions</p>

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) FOR: CORROSION CONTROL AND ABATEMENT

I.  INTRODUCTION:  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is interested in receiving proposals (technical and cost) for research and development (R&D) concepts in the area of corrosion control and abatement for application to the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS).  This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as cited in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102.  A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.  Responses to this BAA will be accepted at the procurement office for 12 months from the date of this announcement.  It may be extended for an additional 24 months, if required.  The Navy reserves the right to select and fund for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  The Navy provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of the Navy to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  

II.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposals may be either basic or applied research.  Proposals that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort. No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded.

III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST:  Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  A.  Advanced testing techniques and computational modeling for the development of predictive equations and prognostics which would serve to reduce operational costs by minimizing required inspections.  B.  Design of component level marine coatings, inhibitors, surface modifications and treatments for the improvement of corrosion resistance, reduced galvanic effects, reduced susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen effects.  Materials may include but are not limited to HSLA steel, stainless steel, aluminum alloys, nickel alloys, copper alloys and composite structures.  C. Development of system level corrosion control technology which may include but is not limited to sensor technology, computational techniques, cathodic protection, smart materials and structures, electrical isolation and advanced detection methods aimed towards reducing system life cycle costs and increased mission readiness.

IV.  CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE.  The Navy is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Grants, Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions). Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at  http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/grants.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research. Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government. NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) seeks information from Contractors and Government agencies on new weapons systems and munitions, and enabling component technologies, suitable for integration on currently fielded Army Aviation platforms. Army Aviation platforms include Apache AH-64D, Kiowa OH-58D, Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH-70A), Blackhawk UH-60 and Army Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The target platforms include manned as well as unmanned aircraft. Potential weapons systems and munitions include, but are not limited to, missiles, rockets, guns or air launched, loiter/attack UASs. Munitions that can be employed across multiple platform types are desired.  Weapon component modularity is also a favorable design consideration in that a modular weapon concept may service a wider variety of aviation platforms. For munitions solutions, the primary interest is in weapon concepts in two weight-classes: approximately a 30 lb munitions (fly-away weight) and approximately a 10 lb munitions.  The weapons system should be able to engage stationary and moving targets such as light vehicles and dismounted personnel in day and night conditions with low collateral damage. The response needs to address the operational concept and give a top level system description to include the munitions, the platform interface, the target acquisition subsystem, the launcher subsystem and warfighter interfaces. Provide a brief description of your product with system performance data to the extent available. Identify unique interface requirements, in particular pertaining to the subsystems listed above. Provide an assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of your product. In addition to the written description, summary information in a format similar to the attached table is desired.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">The Department of Education intends to issue an 18 month extension to existing contract# ED-04-CO-0126.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current period of performance ends on July 20, 2009.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the extension is to enable members of the Westat team to assist the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) with completing the congressionally mandated evaluation of the new federal voucher program as specified in the procurement's new work requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On July 21, 2004 The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) awarded contract ED-04-CO-0126 to Westat of Rockville, Maryland to evaluate the new DC Choice Program, subsequently called the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the impact of receiving and using an OSP scholarship to attend a participating private on academic achievement and school safety and satisfaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.5pt">The evaluation is based primarily on a randomized control trial, comparing outcomes of approximately 2,300 students randomly assigned by lottery to either receive a scholarship or not receive a scholarship. Lotteries of student applicants took place in spring 2004 (for student enrollment in fall 2004) and spring 2005 (for enrollment in fall 2005). Data has been collected for three follow up years, for students in both the scholarship and non-scholarship groups. The contractor has been administering academic assessments, and conducting student, parent, and principal surveys each spring.&nbsp;</span></p>

As the current evaluation contractor, Westat already has the parental consent and relationships with program and school officials necessary to complete the final assessment of the program in a cost-efficient and timely manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the 18-month extension period (July 20, 2009 - January 20, 2011), Westat and its subcontractors, University of Arkansas and Chesapeake Research Associates, will be responsible for collecting and analyzing the additional year of data and comparing it with the previous years of evaluation results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This notice is for informational purposes only.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A request for proposal is not available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested parties may, however, request further information no later than August 1, 2008 by email to Contract Specialist Natasha Boyce at <a href="mailto:Natasha.Boyce@ed.gov">Natasha.Boyce@ed.gov</a>.</span></p>

<DESC>The Forest Service intends to award a HUBZone sole source contract to Roadtech Inc. under Negotiated Procedures for the purchase of a mobile rock crusher.  This requirement is proposed to be a sole source procurement to a certified HUBZone company under the authority of the HUBZone Act of 1997 (15 U.S.C. 631 note) and FAR 19.1302.  Justification for such procedures:  This type of machine is less expensive to operate, recycles previously unsuitable material on site thereby eliminating disposal problems, can operate on small single lane roads, minimizes material handling and hauling costs, has low environmental impacts, and has the capability of blending soil stabilizers or dust abatement products into the road material.  This method not only completely eliminates the costly removal and replacement of the material to be crushed, but can re-establish a native roadbed without spreading seeds and/or diseases from Forest to Forest.  This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive proposals.  If there are businesses that can provide the aforementioned product, and meet the minimum requirements listed below, they must respond by submitting in writing an expression of interest in competing on the procurement and provide supporting documentation as to how their proposed product meets the stated minimum requirements by August 1, 2008 at 3:00 p.m. MST.  The mobile rock crusher must meet the following minimum requirements:  The mobile rock crusher shall be capable of taking oversized rock that has been windrowed along the roadway and crush it as the machine progresses down the road.  Operating sites may vary from steep, narrow mountain roads to developed pit sites.  The machine shall be capable of blending all types of material, regardless of shape or hardness.  Machine shall be capable of crushing rocks up to 16” to an aggregate graduation of ¾” minus.  Mobile rock crusher shall be built to a size that does NOT require any oversize or overweight permits when being transported on State, County, or Federal Highway; crusher shall have adjustment capability of hammers and anvils to adjust for wear to increase the consistency of the aggregate produced; equipment shall be designed with a multi-position lift frame which allows the crusher head to be rotated so crews may work with the underside of the machine facing them at working level to increase safety; the crusher shall have shock protection to reduce vibration; have a removable anvil weldment for ease of service and repair, and the crusher shall have radial attachment of the tooling, which results in much easier and faster replacement of wear parts.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Small Business Administration has issued a final rule that adjusts monetary-based small business size standards for inflation. The rule finalizes the Agency's December 6, 2005 interim final rule that also amended monetary-based small business size standards for inflation. However, this rule adds an additional 8.7 percent to the inflation-adjusted size standards of the December 2005 interim final rule. This additional 8.7 percent accounts for inflation that has occurred since then. This rule also adopts the interim final rule's two-step process for determining eligibility for SBA's Business Loan and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Programs. Furthermore, the rule adopts the revised date that SBA uses to determine size status for purposes of EIDL applications for businesses located in declared disaster areas as a result of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.
<p>DATES: Effective Date: This rule is effective on August 18, 2008.</p>
<p><br />FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Carl Jordan, Office of Size Standards, (202) 205-6618 or sizestandards@sba.gov.</p>
<p>You can read and/or download the final rule published in the July 18, 2008 Federal Register at http://www.regulations.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on a sole source basis to participate in a consensus committee on the Global Health Security Initiative, conducted by the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine (IOM).  This is not a request for a proposal. A solicitation will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The IOM will convene a consensus committee to examine the case why multiple elements of American society should invest in global health, what areas need the most attention, and how best to accomplish the ultimate objective.  The report will address the case for deeper commitment to global health and associated aspects of human development by Americans and communicate specific conclusions and recommendations that would pertain to not only the government in general and individuals of variable economic means, but also the public health and scientific research communities sector, the media, new and established foundations, a range of elements from the university community, and non-governmental organizations to include faith-based and international service organizations.  A final report will be prepared and distributed to the participating Federal agencies and leadership. 

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-5 entitled “Authorized or required by statute.” Executive Order 12832 authorizes procurement of services from NAS on a noncompetitive basis when a department or agency of the executive branch of the Government determines that NAS, because of its unique qualifications, can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet the department’s or agency’s program requirements. 

Therefore, based on the aforementioned facts and the statutory authority at FAR 6.302-5, the Government intends on make a single non-competitive award to the NAS after July 31, 2008.

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers, in coordination with the Army Training Facility Program Office (ATFPO) and in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, intends to make a sole source modification to increase the programmatic capacity of the following MATOC contracts by $49,400,000.00.<BR><BR>W912DY-06-D-0004  Colorado Datascapes, 316 North Tejon Street<BR>                   Colorado Springs, Co 80903<BR>W912DY-06-D-0005  John Gallup & Associates, 625 Broadway, Suite 1201<BR>                   San Diego, CA 92101<BR>W912DY-06-D-0006  Rexroad APC, 620 North Tejon Street Suite 202<BR>                   Colorado Springs, Co 80903<BR>W912DY-06-D-0007  Avila Government Services, Inc., 225 Reinekers Lane,<BR>                   Suite 220 Colorado Springs, Co 80903<BR><BR>This is not a formal solicitation or request for quote.  This synopsis of intent is to give notice of the Governments intent to make a sole source modification to increase capacity of a current award.  Contractors who can provide the U. S Army Engineering and Support Center with the services, in accordance with the synopsis listed below, are invited to submit electronically an affirmative written response indicating a bona fide ability to meet this specific requirement.  <BR><BR>The Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) contracts were awarded under full and open competition to four small businesses for the issuance of fixed-price task orders.  The contracts are providing support to the Army Training Facility Program Office (ATFPO) including infrastructure and training planning studies, MILCON projects justification programming and NEPA documentation, investment strategies and related planning support services.  Since the award of these contracts, the Army Training Facility Program Office (ATFPO) has been assigned Army-wide missions in support of Army Modularity Facilities (AMF), Global Stationing Initiative (GSI); Grow the Army (GTA) initiatives, and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).  These additional requirements have significantly increased the workload and contract dependence for the Huntsville Center in its critical support to the Army in transformation.  <BR><BR>The ATFPO is in need of the continuous core of essential program support services, technical assistance, and oversight support provided through these contracts.  The expertise developed under these contracts provides program customers with timely infrastructure and training planning studies, investment strategies, and related planning support services.  There are no other contracts available within the Huntsville Center to support such broad master planning and MILCON programming tasks.  Use of other Engineering District contracts has been investigated and found that their contract capacity will not support the projected ATFPO workload, in addition to their own support to internal customers.  It is critical that the ATFPO has sufficient support to execute the magnitude of planning and programming actions resulting from the Army Re-stationing and BRAC master planning and MILCON programming requirements.  The added mission assigned to ATFPO, to provide centralized management in the execution of all master planning and MILCON programming missions within accelerated timelines, was not foreseen or anticipated by the Huntsville Center.    <BR><BR>Responses should appear on company letterhead and include, at a minimum, affirmation of active registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), your Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number, any applicable processed credentials and qualifications, and any applicable pricing data or information.  All responses should include a point of contact, telephone number, and electronic address.  Additionally, respondents should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUB Zone, service disabled veteran-owned small business, or qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned.  Responses to this notice of intent will be used to determine the availability of this type of service.  All responsible sources may respond to this synopsis and all responses will be considered by the agency.<BR><BR>Responses should be furnished electronically by 10:00 A.M. CST, Thursday, 24 July 2008 to the reference point of contacts:<BR><BR>Contracting Officer:<BR>Mr. Scott D.

The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 CST on 22 July 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<RESPDATE>073108
<CONTACT>Kristopher A Lemaster, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882995, Email klemaster@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source contract or purchase order to ResearchWorks, Inc. of San Diego, California, the only known provider of identity building and branding strategies specifically related to the programs provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  This is a small business set-aside. 

Injury is the leading cause of death and disability among children and young adults. CDC supports programs to improve the nation's health by preventing injury and violent deaths and disabilities. The higher order outcomes for this project are fourfold: 1) Prevent more injuries, 2) Increase funding, 3) Shape the Center's portfolio of work, and 4) Advance the injury field.

The purpose of this contract is to develop a cohesive, unifying Vision Statement for the Center that makes sense, helps everyone in the Center understand their role in accomplishing the Center's vision, and enables Center personnel to communicate the vision effectively. These activities cascade from the CDC Health protection goals and the critical role that vertical planning plays in their achievement. As a result, the Center should become the go-to agency for injury-related issues and resources should increase.

The contractor will work with the NCIPC's Office of the Director Team staff to identify the current state, the desired state, and the gaps. The contractor will collaboratively craft an overarching Vision Statement for the Center, test and refine it, and create communication tools for each division in relation to the Vision Statement.

It is the Government?s belief that only one responsible source exists and no other product or services will satisfy agency requirements. The following requirement is for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).     

Task #1. Develop detailed work plan within 1 week following contract award.

Task #2. Conduct situational analysis, including detailed analysis of relevant documents and plans, and initial round of phone interviews with key team members within the Center and several selected key informants within CDC. Provide a situation analysis summary and a list of milestones and major tasks within 4 weeks following contract award.

Task #3. Conduct onsite “Zero-based thinking” workshop with the contractor team at the CDC Atlanta, Georgia location focused on identity-building and vision statement development, and presentation to Center’s senior leadership within 6 weeks following contract award.

Task #4. Create recommendations, templates and “litmus tests” for vision statement and identity development, tailoring brand architecture to each division, and applying to organizational needs within 8 weeks following contract award.

Task #5. Provide ongoing capacity-building consulting and scheduled conference calls for team, tied to milestones and tasks for the period beginning 6 weeks following contract award through the conclusion of the 20th week following contract award.

Task #6. Collaboratively craft between three to four potential vision statements and tools for internal and external testing. Provide draft vision statements and testing guidelines no later than 12 weeks following contract award.

Task #7. Provide oversight on the testing performed by the contractor no later than 16 weeks following contract award.

Task #8. Refine and finalize the vision statement and associated communication tools. Provide vision statement and tools no later than 18 weeks following contract award.

Task #9. Present final deliverables during an onsite workshop with the contractor team at the CDC Atlanta, Georgia location, followed by a joint presentation to the Center’s senior leadership. Conduct workshop and presentation no later than 20 weeks following contract award.

Task #10. Provide follow-up advisory consulting (by phone, email, etc.) for an additional thirty days following completion of the final workshop. Provide consultation for the period beginning 20 weeks following contract award through the conclusion of the 24th week following contract award.

Task #11. Provide recommendations for the next steps for NCIPC to take in establishing and promoting identity and brand recognition. Provide recommendations no later than 24 weeks following contract award.

All print deliverables must also be submitted in electronic format.  The contractor will have access to appropriate Team staff to clarify issues pertinent to the completion of the project. CDC staff will provide contractor with background materials and key documentation necessary to complete the tasks to be performed under this contract. CDC staff will assist contractor in identifying appropriate people to interview for this project.

Desired Contractor Experience: Contractor shall have verifiable experience working with CDC and shall be knowledgeable about its programs.

The proposed contract action is for commercial items which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.

Besides educational and vocational opportunities, students receive free housing, meals, medical and dental care, as well as living and clothing allowances.  There are daily recreational activities and outings scheduled weekly for all students who wish to participate.  Counseling services are available to assist students with their individual needs.

The purpose of this effort is to establish agreements in accordance with FAR 16.7 to ensure the United States Department of State’s Foreign Service Institute (FSI)  establishes and maintains qualified alternative sources available for FSI training, seminars, instruction etc for the following topic areas:

•	personal security 
•	hostage survival 
•	crisis management

The agreements solicited are for commercial services or items and is open to all vendors who are registered to do business with the federal government.  This is not a small business set aside as total awards are expected to exceed $100,000 over the life of the agreement.

FSI has unique requirements for contractor support and this is a CONTINUOUS solicitation but has defined proposal submission cut off dates.  Approximately every 6 months, FSI will reopen this solicitation and establish a new proposal due date.  Vendors are encouraged to submit proposals outlining the criteria listed in this solicitation. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation factors in section M, and subsequent awards will be made as necessary. It is in the best interest of the government for the prospective respondent vendors to have an understanding of the FSI mission in regards to the need for flexibility and availability of vendor support.  

FSI provides training and professional development to personnel of the Department of State, the Foreign Service community and other government agencies.   FSI trains Foreign Service Officers (FSO) from all diplomatic posts throughout the world.   Students attend training and classes at FSI which are scheduled and have little, to no room for adjustment.  Students arrive and must be trained during the scheduled times as they must return to post.  Therefore, FSI must ensure trainers, presenters, instructors, etc are available when needed.  Instances occur when a government employee or a contracted vendor is not available to instruct and FSI must find a replacement, as cancelling a course for t his reason is not cost effective for the government.  


The current period for proposal submission is from July 18, 2008 through August 13, 2008 at 1:00 PM Eastern.  

Questions regarding this solicitation must be emailed to PETERSJ@STATE.GOV before 11:00 am, Friday, August 1, 2008.  

Answers and clarifications will be posted to this site in an amendment by COB August 8, 2008.  

NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  

Completed proposals must be received in the FSI Acquistitons office by Wednesday, August 13, 2008 at 1:00 pm eastern.

<SUBJECT>CHARTER OF FISHING VESSELS WITH CREW
<SOLNBR>NFFN7300-8-40502SLW
<RESPDATE>081508
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric and Administration (NOAA), and National Marine Fisheries Services, in Pascagoula, MS intends to procure a multiple award contract (total of 3) for the Charter of Commercial Flynet Trawl Fishing Vessels for Turtle Excluder Device Usability Testing. Flynet trawls are currently exempt from turtle excluder device (TED) regulations. NOAA Fisheries is considering the implementation of TED regulations for the flynet fishery, pending the development of practical and efficient TEDs for these large trawls. The NOAA Fisheries Harvesting Systems Branch has worked cooperatively with several North Carolina flynet fishermen to develop a working TED and to assess the effect which TEDs may have on the target catch. However, quantifying catch loss for the various TED prototypes developed for this fishery has proven difficult. <br />Vessels that participate in this fishery are rigged to tow a single net. This feature combined with a fishing technique that targets individual dense schools of fish results in highly variable catch rates and poses a problem when it comes to traditional gear evaluations designed to determine the amount of catch loss associated with TED use. The traditional method used with vessels rigged to tow single trawls is the alternate haul method and would consist of alternating tows with and without a TED installed. Sample size calculations based on observed catch variability for this fishery and the alternate haul experimental design projected that between 720 and 2,184 total tows would be needed to effectively test a single TED prototype. Based on the sample size calculation and projected costs, it is clear that this technique is not cost effective for this fishery<br />A better alternative is the "trouser trawl" technique, which consists of a standard trawl modified with two codends and dividing panel that runs the length of the trawl body.
<p>The period of performance is 6 days between the months of October 1, 2008 - March 2009.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a trawl vessel with the equipment; captain and crew; fuel; food and berthing accommodations equal to that of the crew for one NOAA Fisheries gear specialists; and all other material necessary to complete the project.</p>
<p>Vessel Requirements:<br />1. Stern trawl fishing vessel, 70 ft in length or larger, with hydraulic net reel with capacity for holding a single flynet with a 85-foot headrope length or larger.</p>
<p>2. Vessel engine power sufficient to tow an 85 ft. headrope length flynet spread by steel doors at a minimum of 3.5 knots over the bottom.</p>
<p>3. Sufficient bunk space to accommodate one NOAA Fisheries staff.</p>
<p>4. An indoor area that can be designated for camera equipment set up and break down.</p>
<p>Other Vessel Equipment Requirements:<br />a. One each flynet 85 ft or greater.<br />b. Two each steel doors<br />c. Fathometer- for determining bottom depth. <br />d. Radar<br />e. GPS vessel positioning unit.<br />f. Vessel track plotter. <br />g. Current U.S. Coast Guard Safety Inspection certification.</p>
<p>Crew Requirements:<br />1. Captain and crew experienced in deployment, retrieval and repair of flynet trawls and trawl doors.Captain and crew experienced in installation of TEDs and TED components.</p>

The period of performance is being procured from date of award through June 30, 2009. Caribbean acroporids have undergone a 97% decline in regional abundance since the 1970s, resulting in a Threatened status under the Endangered Species Act. NMFS will likely identify the establishment and maintenance of coral nurseries as an action necessary for the recovery of the species. One is currently being maintained by a contractor for staghorn corals. The purpose of the existing nursery is the hands-on salvage of orphaned coral fragments and short-term care and growth of the corals to be used in research and restoration of Caribbean reefs. The contractor will provide the maintenance and care of fragments for specific research and restoration projects to be carried out within the Florida Reef Tract. The objective of this project is to maintain and expand existing staghorn coral nursery in the Florida Keys to provide staghorn coral colonies for several identified research and restoration projects in the Florida Keys. Several staghorn coral research and restoration projects have been or are in the process of being permitted to occur within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS). These projects include the requirement for reared colonies of staghorn corals from known genotypes and known origin. A staghorn coral nursery exists within the FKNMS which maintains several approximately 2,000 staghorn coral colonies of identified genotypes from know origin. <br />The contractor shall be able to perform the following tasks to maintenance and expand a staghorn coral nursery:<br />&bull; Fabricating disks and pedestal on which the staghorn coral fragments are attached<br />&bull; Transporting to and placing of the disks and pedestals at the staghorn coral nursery<br />&bull; Fragmenting existing staghorn coral colonies to create new colonies<br />&bull; Attaching the new staghorn coral colonies to the disks<br />&bull; Maintaining and monitoring of existing and new staghorn coral colonies<br />o Clean colonies<br />o Measure colonies<br />o Photograph colonies<br />o Remove corallivorous snails<br />&bull; Production of monitoring reports including data entry and reduction

Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) defines new standards for personal identity verification (PIV) of Federal employees and contractors. This directive resulted in the Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS-201) that detailed the requirements for federal agencies. One of these requirements is the implementation of new SmartCard-based PIV credentials for employees and contractors, and the corresponding physical security system requirements to read and process these new credentials. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has adopted the Department of Defense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC) for its PIV credentials. These CAC cards implement the requirements and standards for FIPS-201 PIV II credentials. The NMFS building currently has a GE Security access control system utilizing Micro/5-PXN microcontrollers. The system supports and uses 125 kHz proximity cards. The current proximity card readers and microcontrollers are not capable of reading the new DoD CAC cards. The contractor shall provide and install 46 FIPS-201 compliant and approved card readers and associated equipment as replacements for the existing card readers, to upgrade the three existing microcontroller Computer Processing Unit (CPU) boards, and to perform any and all required reconfigurations and programming to make use of the new card readers and CAC cards. All of the new card readers will replace existing card readers in the same locations, so no relocations or new locations of card readers will be required as part of this contract. All existing wiring can be used for the new card readers, so no additional wiring should be necessary. Since the implementation of the new CAC cards will be phased-in over a period of months or years, the new card readers must also be backwardly compatible with the existing 125 kHz proximity technology so that the existing access cards can also be used with the system. All tasks necessary to utilize both the existing 125 kHz access cards as well as the new 13.56 MHz FIPS-201 PIV II DoD CAC cards must be performed as part of this project. All access control equipment installed as part of this project must be on the GSA HSPD-12 FIPS-201 Approved Products List located at http://fips201ep.cio.gov/apl.php, where applicable. <br />In addition to the access control system, the NOAA Fisheries Service SERO building also has a closed circuit TV video camera surveillance system. This system utilizes a number of cameras for both real-time monitoring and DVR recording of the images. Several of the existing cameras are over ten years old and are in poor condition, providing very poor, grainy images. The contactor shall to provide and install 11 new color video cameras as replacements for the existing cameras, and to perform any and all required reconfigurations and programming to make use of the new cameras. <br />Interested parties can request a copy of the Request for Quotation. This is a small business set-aside. The NAICS code for this action is 334310. Small business size standard shall not to exceed 750 employees. This support service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items Procedures. Interested parties can request a copy of the Request for Quotation on or about July 28, 2008.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric and Administration (NOAA), and National Marine Fisheries Services, in Pascagoula, MS intends to procure services for the creation of a final printing-ready layout for the guide being developed by the NOAA Fisheries Caribbean Field Office with information on the permit process and design of projects in the coastal zone. The actual printing of the guide will be done by the Government Printing Office (GPO). The objective is to promote the wise use of coastal resources. The guide will be bilingual and is aimed at audiences planning and constructing projects in the coastal zone of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). The purchase order is part of a multi-year effort to provide educational materials to stakeholders who potentially contribute to problems of land-based sources of pollution in the U.S. Caribbean. The project also builds on efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands that resulted in guides for law enforcement officers that explain the biology behind the creation of laws and regulations related to the management of coral reef fishery species and their habitats. This work will support local efforts to increase public awareness and reduce the impacts of coastal development on marine resources, which are focal areas of the Coral Reef Task Force (CRTF), and the USVI and Puerto Rico Local Action Strategies. The project is also part of the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Regional Office's efforts as part of the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP). Coastal development is recognized as having a significant impact on coral reef ecosystems through declines in water quality associated with the transport of sediments and pollutants in runoff waters and directly from point sources to these systems. The importance of these impacts in terms of the affect on the health of the coral reef ecosystem were recognized by the CRTF and included as part of the land-based development factor in LAS development. Coastal development can cause direct impacts to habitats through in-water construction. Coastal development also leads to indirect impacts such as increases in numbers of recreational vessels and resultant increases in accidental groundings and spills of petroleum products, as well as increases in marine debris. This project will address the threat of coastal development by educating stakeholders regarding means to avoid or minimize impacts to the coral reef ecosystem associated with development. The project will enable the layout of the guide for coastal municipalities, developers, contractors, and other key stakeholder groups for submission to the GPO for printing. The guide will compile information on coral spawning, dock construction, and other best management practices in order to provide recommendations regarding the avoidance and minimization of coastal development impacts to the coral reef ecosystem and important coastal habitats such as wetlands that assist in maintaining the health of the coral reef ecosystem. This project is being initiated as a component of NOAA Fisheries' efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089. The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to "preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and the marine environment." The contractor shall complete the work in two distinct tasks: pre-production and production. Short-term results will consist of the layout of the bilingual guide for printing by GPO and distribution to our stakeholders in USVI and Puerto Rico. Long-term results will consist of increased public awareness regarding important coastal resources in the U.S. Caribbean and the design of projects so as to avoid and minimize impacts to these resources. The period of performance is from date of award through January 31, 2009.<br />Interested parties can request a copy of the Request for Quotation. This is a small business set-aside.

<CONTACT>Damon McGill, Procuring Contracting Officer, Phone 301-757-7063, Fax 301-757-7054, Email damon.mcgill@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command will be soliciting a proposal for support of the F-18 aircraft system’s Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Test Program Set (TPS).  Honeywell Incorporated was responsible for the design and development of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU).  Part of the design effort included providing source data to the F-18 aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) (Boeing Company) which in turn was utilized to develop the ECU TPS. Honeywell Incorporated will be solicited for this requirement via a stand alone contract.  This effort will include providing expert consultation services to the USN to improve the existing TPS, review of  the existing TPS, comparison of the existing TPS to the OEM Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP), noting differences (test points, test point pass/fail criteria), noting any repeated or redundant test points in the TPS, analysis of  the potential impacts of disregarding TPS test points, evaluation of the pass/fail criteria for test points analyzed, determination of  whether the test points can be expanded (determine whether the troubleshooting can be improved to diagnose problems to a single card), understanding of the problems with existing TPS, propose revisions to existing TPS and verifying the adequacy of any proposed fixes.

This requirement is restricted to Honeywell Incorporated, the designer, developer, and integrator of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU), because Honeywell Incorporated is the only source that possesses the required proprietary rights data and a nondisclosure agreement with the F-18 OEM that are necessary to redesign, re-develop and produce the required Intermediate level Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE). Further, as the designer, developer, and integrator of the ECU, Honeywell developed the necessary TPS source data and is the only firm that possesses the detailed technical knowledge, engineering expertise, aircraft integration information, technical data, combined aircraft and PSE expertise, as well as the trained technical personnel to fully integrate the needed new test capability with the F-18 aircraft platform.  Honeywell Incorporated is considered to be the only source that is capable of providing the required range of integrated support.

Material Requirements (FAR 52.211-5) (AUG 2000)(a) Definitions. As used in this clause? ?New? means composed of previously unused components, whether manufactured from virgin material, recovered material in the form of raw material, or materials and by-products generated from, and reused within, an original manufacturing process; provided that the supplies meet contract requirements, including but not limited to, performance, reliability, and life expectancy. ?Reconditioned? means restored to the original normal operating condition by readjustments and material replacement. ?Recovered material? means waste materials and by-products recovered or diverted from solid waste, but the term does not include those materials and by-products generated from, and commonly reused within, an original manufacturing process. ?Remanufactured? means factory rebuilt to original specifications. ?Virgin material? means? (1) Previously unused raw material, including previously unused copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, iron, other metal or metal ore; or (2) Any undeveloped resource that is, or with new technology will become, a source of raw materials. (b) Unless this contract otherwise requires virgin material or supplies composed of or manufactured from virgin material, the Contractor shall provide supplies that are new, reconditioned, or remanufactured, as defined in this clause. (c) A proposal to provide unused former Government surplus property shall include a complete description of the material, the quantity, the name of the Government agency from which acquired, and the date of acquisition. (d) A proposal to provide used, reconditioned, or remanufactured supplies shall include a detailed description of such supplies and shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval. (e) Used, reconditioned, or remanufactured supplies, or unused former Government surplus property, may be used in contract performance if the Contractor has proposed the use of such supplies, and the Contracting Officer has authorized their use. 








Time of Delivery (FAR 52.211-8)  (JUN 1997)(a) The Government requires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:
9 Months After AwardThe Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply.Offeror?s Proposed Delivery Schedule 
ITEM NO.		QUANTITY 		WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT
0001 (Sample Lab)	1 Each			________________________________	
(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. 
However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor?s date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term ?working day? excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. 
Warranty of Supplies of a Complex Nature (FAR 52.246-18)  (MAY 2001)(a) Definitions. As used in this clause? ?Acceptance? means the act of an authorized representative of the Government by which the Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of existing and identified supplies, or approves specific services rendered, as partial or complete performance of the contract. ?Supplies? means the end items furnished by the Contractor and related services required under this contract. The word does not include ?data.? (b) Contractor?s obligations. (1) The Contractor warrants that for the period of one year after delivery, the Mobile Laboratory furnished under this contract will be free from defects in material and workmanship and will conform with all requirements of this contract; provided, however, that with respect to Government-furnished property, the Contractor?s warranty shall extend only to its proper installation, unless the Contractor performs some modification or other work on the property, in which case the Contractor?s warranty shall extend to the modification or other work. (2) Any supplies or parts thereof corrected or furnished in replacement shall be subject to the conditions of this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered. This warranty shall be equal in duration to that set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies. (3) The Contractor shall not be obligated to correct or replace supplies if the facilities, tooling, drawings, or other equipment or supplies necessary to accomplish the correction or replacement have been made unavailable to the Contractor by action of the Government. In the event that correction or replacement has been directed, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the nonavailability. (4) The Contractor shall also prepare and furnish to the Government data and reports applicable to any correction required (including revision and updating of all affected data called for under this contract) at no increase in the contract price. (5) When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the place of delivery specified in the contract (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point of acceptance) to the Contractor?s plant and return. (6) All implied warranties of merchantability and ?fitness for a particular purpose? are excluded from any obligation contained in this contract. (c) Remedies available to the Government. (1) In the event of a breach of the Contractor?s warranty in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Government may, at no increase in contract price? (i) Require the Contractor, at the place of delivery specified in the contract (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point of acceptance) or at the Contractor?s plant, to repair or replace, at the Contractor?s election, defective or nonconforming supplies; or (ii) Require the Contractor to furnish at the Contractor?s plant the materials or parts and installation instructions required to successfully accomplish the correction. (2) If the Contracting Officer does not require correction or replacement of defective or nonconforming supplies or the Contractor is not obligated to correct or replace under paragraph (b)(3) of this clause, the Government shall be entitled to an equitable reduction in the contract price. (3) The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of any breach of the warranty in paragraph (b) of this clause within  45 days after discovery of defects.  The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written recommendation within 30 days as to the corrective action required to remedy the breach. After the notice of breach, but not later than 30 days after receipt of the Contractor?s recommendation for corrective action, the Contracting Officer may, in writing, direct correction or replacement as in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, and the Contractor shall, notwithstanding any disagreement regarding the existence of a breach of warranty, comply with this direction. If it is later determined that the Contractor did not breach the warranty in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the contract price will be equitably adjusted. (4) If supplies are corrected or replaced, the period for notification of a breach of the Contractor?s warranty in paragraph (c)(3) of this clause shall be 30 days from the furnishing or return by the Contractor to the Government of the corrected or replaced supplies or parts thereof, or, if correction or replacement is effected by the Contractor at a Government or other activity, for 30 days thereafter. (5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item, prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. NSR-08-508 herein is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-14.  This is not a small business set aside.  This RFP is for full and open competition.  

----------------------------------------
BACKGROUND
In April 2001, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) revised 10 CFR 50.47(b)(10) of its emergency preparedness regulations.  The revised rule requires that States with population within the 10-mile emergency planning zone of commercial nuclear power plants, consider including potassium iodide (KI) as a protective measure for the general public to supplement sheltering and evacuation in the unlikely event of a severe nuclear power plant accident.  Concomitant with this action, the NRC offered to provide a supply of KI to each State or Tribe that incorporated KI for the general public into their emergency plans.  If local governments were designated by the State, NRC also offered to provide a supply to the local governments.  In addition to providing the initial supply of KI, NRC agreed in September 2006 to provide replenishment of the potassium iodide for those States currently providing it for populations within the 10-mile (EPZs) of commercial nuclear power plants.

---------------------------------------
OBJECTIVE 
The Contractor shall provide shipments of 65 mg KI tablets produced by an FDA-approved manufacturer, in the quantities and to the locations designated by the NRC Project Officer (PO).

---------------------------------------
SCOPE OF WORK 
The Contractor shall supply and distribute Potassium Iodide (KI) tablets as ordered by the NRC.

--------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION OF POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS
Each 65 mg KI tablet shall be manufactured by an FDA-approved manufacturer and must be an FDA approved product.  Each tablet shall be scored-in to enable the user to break the tablet into at least two pieces.  Each 65 mg KI tablet shall have the maximum FDA-approved shelf life from date of acceptance by the NRC or the State or Tribe to which delivery was made.  Each tablet shall be individually packaged.

--------------------------------------------
TASK 1 
SUPPLY POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS 
The contractor shall provide NRC orders of 65 mg KI tablets, as ordered by NRC.  The estimated amount that will be required for this contract is 2,500,000 tablets.  This figure is provided as an estimate only.  The NRC is not obligated to order the estimated number as a minimum, nor as a maximum amount stated herein.  

-----------------------------------------------
TASK 2 
DISTRIBUTION 
The contractor shall ship the specified number of KI tablets, to the locations identified in the email at the time the order is placed.  The contractor shall maintain records of the shipping logs, showing quantities sent, receiving organization and proof of delivery.  A copy of these documents shall be provided to the NRC PO no later than five (5) calendar days from the date of delivery.  KI tablets shall be provided in a manner which provides ease of distribution, packaging, and storage; and maintains the shelf-life integrity of the tablets, once provided to the State or Tribe.  As a matter of redistribution and tamper avoidance, individually packaged or blister packaged tablets are the preferred method in packaging the tablets.  The NRC estimates that three deliveries will be required to three different states.  However, the NRC is not obligated to order any estimated number of distributions as a minimum, nor as a maximum amount stated herein.      

 ---------------------------------- 
DAMAGED/CRUSHED TABLETS 
The Contractor shall replace, at no cost to the NRC, any tablets that have been damaged or crushed during shipping.  The NRC will provide claims for replacement no later than 45 calendar days after delivery.  The Contractor shall replace the damaged/crushed tablets no later than 90 calendar days from receipt of NRC’s notification.

--------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
BILL-TO AND SHIP-TO ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS 
The Contractor shall ship the tablets to various locations specified by the NRC PO, while maintaining one overall Bill-to Account.

Contracting Activity:  Army Contracting Agency Information Technology, E-Commerce & Commercial Contracting Center (ITEC4), Alexandria, Virginia 22331-1700. <BR><BR>2.  Description of Action:  Approval is requested to award a contractual action, with option quantities, to obtain Xceedium Gatekeeper model XG-50i (remote access control appliance) to support the Medical Communication for Combat Casualty for Deployed Forces mission supporting OIF/OEF. The type of contract action will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) using OPA funds.  The requirement is for a quantity of 200 with four option quantities of 200 each, for a total of 1,000 units.  <BR><BR>3. Description of Supplies/Services:  The Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) is the Armys single Information Management/Information Technology System for automation and digitization efforts for deployable medical forces.  MC4s mission is to develop and deploy an integrated family of medical communication and automated information systems to enhance command, control, and communications giving commanders at all echelons visibility of their medical situation as well as the status of their troops.  MC4 automates and links the ten Army Medical Department (AMEDD) functional areas, enhances digital communications, and promotes battlefield medical situational understanding through emerging commercial-off-the-shelf/government-off-the-shelf COTS/GOTS technologies.  MC4 links healthcare providers, medical diagnostic systems, command and control (C2), and information systems at all tactical echelons.  The MC4 systems provide visibility of deployed medical forces and casualties, as well as, an accurate and timely means for documenting healthcare from the point of care to a centralized database in the theater of operations.  The Xceedium Gatekeeper is the single device that meets all of the agencys requirements.  The Xceedium Gatekeeper is a Secure Access Gateway for provisioning granular access to resources within each of the MC4 Level 2 and 3 hospitals.  It is an appliance that enhances the overall perimeter security of each site while allowing the appropriate levels of access to doctors, internal IT support and 3rd party vendors for accessing and maintaining the infrastructure.   The requirement is for a base quantity of 200 units with an estimated value of  $6,637,000 and four option quantities of 200 units each, each having a value of $6,637,000, for a total estimated value of  $33,185,000.  The option quantities will be evaluated at the time of award and may be exercised any time during a period ending three years after award.  <BR><BR>4. Authority Cited:   10 U.S.C. Section 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c) Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy Agency requirements.<BR><BR>5. Reason for Authority Cited:  MC4 Software packages are integrated to meet Section <BR><BR>Control No._08-048____<BR><BR>1074f, 10 United States Code (USC), mandated medical information system <BR>requirements. The proposed source is Xceedium Gatekeeper. It is the only product that can meet the Governments requirements, which are:<BR>"	Common Criteria EAL-2 or higher (DOD 5000 requirement)<BR>"	FIPS 140-2 certified (DOD 5000 requirement)<BR>"	Provide the end-user only access to the application and/or devices that correspond with the rights based on the users role.<BR>"	Integrated support for the DOD PKI software based certificate.<BR>"	End-user authentication support for DOD Common Access Card.<BR>"	Ability to convert Telnet transport protocols to Secure Shell (SSH) / HTTPS.<BR>"	Authenticates with or without MS Active Directory.<BR>"	Provides a browser-based VMS Terminal Emulation key mapping that matches the legacy systems and the new replacement systems.<BR>"	Demonstrated compatibility (the unit is currently deployed at 70+ CONUS medical treatment facilities).<BR><BR>There is unique functionality in the Xceedium Gatekeeper that allows MC4 to be in compliance with and receipt of the Authority to Operate (ATO), renewed in January 2008. In short, Xceedium Gatekeeper alleviates the security concern around using the Telnet Protocol for accessing the TC2 system. By using the Secure Shell (SSH) to Telnet Protocol conversion utility, MC4 is able to provide the secure access to doctors worldwide in real time. Additionally, the Xceedium product implements an extremely granular level of access for administrators managing the systems, including leapfrog prevention, and extensive audit, logging and session recording to further maintain the security posture and administration capabilities. <BR><BR>The Authority to Operate is issued by PEO EIS Director, Mr. Winkler for the DIACAP (Defense Information Assurance Certification Authorization Program  network security) related to the Common Criteria EAL-2 or higher (DOD 5000 requirement) and FIPS 140-2 certified (DOD 5000 requirement). Information assurance (security) is required by Army Regulation 25-2 (Information Assurance Standards mandated by DOD Directive 8570, Information Assurance Training, Certification and Workforce Management).<BR>The ATO is needed for meeting the requirements of the United States Army Information Systems Engineering Command (USAISEC), which is located at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. ISEC has the primary mission of system engineering and integration of information systems for the U.S. Army. The MC4 mission includes the design, engineering, integration, development, sustainment, installation, testing, and acceptance of information systems. USAISEC provides matrix support to the Program Executive Officer and Program Manager structure for systems engineering and integration of assigned information systems.<BR><BR>In April 27, 2004, President Bush called for widespread adoption of interoperable Electronic Health Records (EHRs) within 10 years, and also established the position of <BR>										    Control No. __08-048___ <BR><BR>National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.  The Xceedium device <BR>provides secure access to the in-patient portion of the EHR.<BR><BR>Other solutions investigated were capable of providing partial features, but no other product provided anything close to the whole feature set required.  This product will enable compliance with security requirements of the ATO without which performance or remote access and administration to the doctors and support personnel cannot be accomplished.  Using this product allows for the minimizing of the physical footprint in theater, keeping personnel out of harms way, improves the doctors accessibility to the TC2 System further improving healthcare response time, and improves over all Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and uptime on systems where outages severely impact the ability to deliver efficient healthcare services in theater. A SLA is that part of a service contract where the level of service is formally defined. In practice, the term SLA is used to refer to the contracted delivery time of the service or performance.  <BR><BR>If this equipment is not deployed to the MC4 infrastructure, it would result in MC4 not being able to meet the ATO requirements and result in the violation of the ATO. This delay would then have further impact to the war fighter.  This would cause all of the in-patient medical records to become unavailable to medical providers. Army Medical Command and MC4 will not be able to comply with Presidential Executive Order 13335. <BR><BR>The Government will not realize any cost savings from reducing the need for transportation of on-site support teams or the improvement of mean-time between repair times on medical computer systems and medical equipment.  Cost savings would come from the capability of the device providing real-time remote repair and diagnostic of medical equipment which will significantly reduce wasted travel hours as well as reduce the possibility of harm on the travelers within a hostile environment.  In addition, there will be improved medical access from unsecure to secure transmission of the health care records.  <BR><BR>6.  Efforts to obtain Competition: An analysis of alternatives was performed by MC4 Engineering which included products from manufacturers such as Cisco, Juniper, Attachmate, Xceedium, as well as, GPL/Open Source. Each product fulfilled one or more of the requirements but none could fulfill all the requirements except for the Xceedium Gatekeeper. Alternative products did not have the following features:<BR>"	Ability to convert Telnet transport protocols to Secure Shell (SSH) / HTTPS.<BR>"	Browser-based VMS Terminal Emulation key mapping.<BR><BR>On a previous acquisition for this same product, it was determined that the Xceedium Gatekeeper is the only product that can meet agency requirements.  No other products were found that could meet all of the Governments requirements.  The market research also provided cost comparisons amongst potential vendors for the Xceedium product.   An open market small business set-aside competition was conducted and six vendors submitted proposals with detailed pricing information.   For the current procurement, the <BR>Control No. _08-048___<BR><BR>brand name requirement will be set aside for small business and competed amongst open market small business sources.  <BR><BR>7. Actions to Increase Competition:  The Xceedium XG-50i is available from open market sources including CDW-G, Apptis, Netcenter (Multimax).  It is also available from multiple Small Business Companies that participated in the last contract award competition for the Gatekeeper. This is a follow-on award to purchase more Xceediums and to add option quantities.  Xceedium is not available through the ASCP or through GSA schedule, so the acquisition will be set aside for small business and competed amongst open market small business sources. MC4 engineers will continue to pursue market research and have continual market surveillance which allows them to rapidly identify potential sources of supply/services for future requirements and to assess the benefits of competition (products/service quality, timely delivery, lower prices, etc.).<BR><BR>8. Market Research:  As indicated in previous paragraphs, MC4 has conducted sufficient market research to determine that there is no other product that can meet the Governments requirement.  Market research was carried out throughout the Advanced Change Study Notice (ACSN) and Engineering Change Process (ECP). The ACSN started in May 4, 2007 and continued until the control board approval for the ECP in July 2007 with contract awarded previously for the Xceedium Gatekeepers on 9 October 2007.  No other products were found that could meet all of the Governments requirements.  However, through this market research, MC4 has identified several sources from which to obtain the brand name product. As a result open market, competition can be conducted.  In addition, for the previous acquisition for the Xceedium product, a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation was posted on FedBizOps for ten business days and six responses were received and considered.  All quotes were determined to be acceptable technically.  <BR> <BR>9. Interested Sources: Notices required by FAR 5.201 shall be or have been published, and that any bids or proposals received shall be considered and reviewed. For a previous acquisition for the Xceedium product, a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation was posted on <BR>FedBizOps for ten business days and six responses were received and considered.  All quotes were determined to be acceptable technically.  Since the time period between the previous acquisition for this product and the current acquisition has only been seven months, it is determined that no additional sources are available for this product.  ITEC4 plans to publish a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for this requirement.  It is not expected that any other sources will express an interest. <BR><BR>10.

Contracting Activity: Information Technology E-Commerce and Commercial Contracting Center (ITEC4), 2461 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, Virginia 22331-1700<BR><BR>2. Description of Action:  This action requests approval for an acquisition that uses a brand name description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer.  The requirement is for twelve (12) Ironport X1050 email gateway appliances and two (2) Ironport M1050 email gateway logging and reporting servers. The total estimated price of this action is $885,656. The type of contract action for this acquisition will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) using fiscal year 2007 Other Procurement Army (OPA) funds.  The requirement will be satisfied through an Open Market Small Business Set-Aside.  A combined Synopsis/Solicitation will be published on FedBizOps along with this brand name justification.  <BR>3. Description of Supplies: The Project Manager, Network Services Center (NSC)/ Army Enterprise Systems (AES) has responsibility for the CONUS Army Enterprise Exchange system, which provides email access and routing capabilities to the Continental United States (CONUS) Active Directory Enterprise Electronic Mail users.  This acquisition is to purchase twelve (12) Ironport email gateway appliances that virus/content scan in/outbound email.  The purchase also includes two (2) logging and reporting appliances to support/complement the new gateways.  The definition of an appliance is that it is a custom piece of hardware with software specifically tailored for its unique purpose.  This equipment will upgrade the six (6) Ironport email gateways already in production and will add an additional six (6) more email gateways at the two (2) Army CONUS Exchange 2003 routing hubs.  In addition, the two (2) logging and reporting servers, one (1) at each Army Processing Center (APC) will be upgraded with the two (2) Ironport M1050 appliances.  These devices will support the CONUS Army Enterprise Exchange System by increasing email scanning capacity and providing redundancy to ensure no downtime and less email delivery delay due to a single device failure.  These gateway devices protect the in/outbound email for the CONUS Enterprise email environment.<BR><BR>4.  Authority Cited:  10 U.S.C. Section 2304 (c) (1); FAR 6.302-1 (c) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements; and FAR 11.105.  <BR><BR>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  The CONUS Army Enterprise Exchange System provides email access and routing capabilities to the CONUS Active Directory Enterprise users.  The Ironport Gateway devices support the CONUS Army Enterprise Exchange email system and are essential to meet the daily operational email routing mission for the CONUS Active Directory Enterprise users.  Due to the function, design and specifications of brand name parts selected for the Army Exchange System, a change from the Ironport product line could alter the operation and security of the CONUS Army Exchange email system. <BR>This Exchange email system, of which the Ironport Gateway appliances specified above are a subsystem, was engineered and accredited as part of the total system.   The Exchange email systems Security Accreditation package, Authorization to Operate, and Networthiness documentation and approval are specific to using the Ironport devices to support in/outbound email scanning.   Any changes in the Exchange email systems products would require the Exchange email system to update the current Security Accreditation package and Networthiness documentation and approval.  The Government requires the Ironport devices because they match the currently installed CONUS Active Directory Enterprise email gateway systems and the current software licenses can be used to ensure compatibility and avoid redundant costs.  The integration of another system would require at least 6-8 months of effort to reengineer the system since the Exchange email system is configured specifically for the Ironport devices.  <BR><BR>	The introduction of a new email gateway device type to the Exchange email system would incur an estimated $2,000,000 to reengineer the Exchange email system and to retrain personnel to work with new products.  More importantly, the reengineering and retraining of personnel would take at least eight months.     <BR><BR>It is critical that the appliances be purchased and installed as soon as possible, as the current servers are approaching their capacity.  The operations staff at the CTNOSC continuously monitors the gateway systems performance.  Queue sizes and other performance indicators are approaching levels that caused the e-mail service slowdown in July 2007.  Gateway email appliances scan each and every incoming and outgoing email for viruses and SPAM.  This action protects the computing environment by preventing the spread of computer viruses and keeping unnecessary data traffic off the networks.  The appliances identify illegitimate incoming email traffic (SPAM or viruses) and immediately drop those messages.  This filtering is necessary to conserve network bandwidth for legitimate operational use.  If a gateway appliance becomes overloaded, as a result of delayed capacity increases, system-wide mail delivery delays and sometimes even outages can slow down the email routing mission throughout CONUS. In July 2007, the CONUS Army Exchange system experienced an email delivery delay that was attributed mostly to inadequate capacity in the email gateway systems.  That delay directly affected 170,000 users.  <BR><BR>In November 2007, PM NSC added new systems to meet demand and now, again, the system is approaching capacity.  The current increase in system load is caused by the unanticipated resource utilization as users are migrated to the new system.  This upgrade will prevent the email delays that happened in July 2007 and will accommodate the demand needed for 338,000 user migrations to the new email system by 30 September 2008.  The Army continually monitors the system and expects that another failure of the type experienced in July 2007 will occur if the additional appliances are not purchased and installed by the time all of the user migrations occur.  A delay of eight months to reengineer the Exchange email system with products other than Ironports would almost certainly bring about another failure.  If those delays and outages do occur, PM NSC would lose an estimated $2  2.5 million in productivity per delay or outage for the 278,000 current systems users on the system.  Soldiers and commanders deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan use this system to communicate with their leaders and counterparts in the United States.  Delayed/denied communication in this scenario would affect mission and could result in loss of life in the field. <BR><BR>Finally, the Ironport e-mail gateway subsystem also provides connectivity to the AKO/DKO email system. The AKO/DKO e-mail system also uses Ironport e-mail gateways.  The CONUS e-mail and AKO/DKO Ironport e-mail gateways and specifically configured to compliment each other and work together.  Implementation of both e-mail systems are under PEO EISs purview.<BR><BR>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  For the reasons provided above, no other product can be substituted.  This requirement will be competed as a small business set-aside among resellers of these name brand products; and this J&A will be synopsized on FedBizOpps.  <BR><BR>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  A competition for a rearchitected and redesigned system will take place when the CONUS Army Exchange 2003 is upgraded to Exchange 2007.  The Army expects to begin its market research for the upcoming replacement within the next six months.   <BR>8.  Market Research:  Market Research of alternative configurations is an ongoing process at PM NSC. That research will be applied to the upcoming Exchange 2007 system design.<BR>9.  Interested Sources:  The decision to procure the existing system, including all components was made over 32 months ago.  Since that time, no manufacturers of products similar to the Ironport devices have expressed any interest in proving a substitution product.  There are several authorized resellers of Ironport appliances to include Sun Management, Inc., Apollo, and GovBuys.<BR><BR>10. Other Facts:   None known.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>11.

<DESC><p>On 16 July 08 a site visit was conducted for interested parties regarding this solicitation. The attendance list is attached for information purposes. Issues/questions raised regarding details of the Statement of Work and the Government's answer to them are given here.<br />1.Q: Do you want an automatic or manual shaker on the collector?<br />A: Automatic.<br />2.Q: How high above the floor do you want these ducts to be?<br />A: 10 feet to the underside of the ducts will be adequate.<br />3.Q: Where do you want these floor sweep ducts placed?<br />A: The floor sweep duct on the west wall should be no closer than 100" from the center line of the panel saw. There is no placement preference for the duct on the east wall, except that it must not interfere with the door there.<br />4.Q: Putting an intake hose or duct on the panel saw will make using it very difficult. Are you sure you want one on that saw?<br />A: Do not install a collector/intake on the panel saw. The floor sweep intake will suffice for that tool.<br />5.Q: There is already an intake hood on the radial arm saw. Will that stay, or are we to replace it?<br />A: The current hood will stay. The contractor is only required to connect ducting to the new collector duct system.<br />6.Q: The solicitation says Holloman Engineers will provide electric hookup. Specifically, what elements of hookup will Holloman provide?<br />A: Holloman Engineers will provide the following; 208V, 30Amp, 3-phase electricity service. That service is currently run to the existing collector, and the control switch for the current system is attached to the building wall directly behind the existing collectors. Running electrical power from the currently mounted control switch through the building wall to the outside, providing and installing an outside-mounted master switch, physical connections, and weatherproofing of the penetration and connections is the contractor's responsibility. As currently wired, any time any of the woodworking machinery is turned on, the collector system activates. This arrangement should not be affected by installation of the new collector system. <br />7.Q: The solicitation says Holloman will provide the concrete pad for the new collector. How do we coordinate getting that pad poured?<br />A: Holloman Engineers will indeed provide the collector pad. In order to shorten the time to have this accomplished, all bids/quotes/proposals must contain specifications of the collector's height, dimensions, weight, size, footprint, and details of how it is to be mounted or connected to its base, clearance required from buildings and other obstructions, and anything else that might affect operation or maintenance due to proximity of the collector to Bldg. 311. Upon selection and award, the Holloman Contracting office will pass that information to Engineers for coordination and execution of pad installation. <br />8.Q: Will the submission date change because of the time required to confirm answers to a couple of these questions?<br />A: Yes. The revised date for submission of quotes/bids is now 1200 Mountain Daylight Time, 31 July 08.</p>

<p>S/N for GFE barriers 6498A-1 and 6498B-1</p>
<p>Installation Instructions for IP500 Beam Barriers</p>
<p>DELTA MODEL IP500 (H) CRASH BEAM<br />INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS<br />General<br />The objective of the Delta Model IP500 (H) installation is to accurately align and position the two pods relative to each other. Each pod consists of two modules: a larger module that provides most of the weight, and a smaller module that serves as an anchor for the chain crash tube. The pods should be oriented so that the hinge side is on the side of the roadway required by the installation (the larger weight pods can be towards or away from the threat vehicle). The center distance between the pods is determined by the order data. So there are no mistakes, the materials should be laid out and examined; in particular, the crash beam steel chain assembly should be measured to confirm its free length. The crash beam assembly is shipped with a heavy, special processed steel chain inside the crash beam with the latch end pin installed. The chain has yellow two-piece coupling links at both ends. With the crash beam assembly laid out on a horizontal surface, measure the distance between the outside of the latch pin and the corresponding location on the yellow coupling at the other end of the chain. This dimension less 43.5 inch [110, 5 cm] should be at least 1.0 inch [2, 5 cm] greater than the specified clear opening.</p>
<p>If on first examination the chain appears to be shorter than specified, the chain should be inspected to see that it has not been twisted or tangled within the crash beam assembly. A twisted chain that appears to be short can most often be corrected by turning the free end of the chain while still in the crash beam assembly. If this doesn't work the chain should be removed from the crash beam assembly and checked while laying straight, flat and untwisted on a horizontal surface.</p>
<p>After the pods are set in place and the concrete is allowed to harden, the Beam Barrier itself is assembled on the posts.</p>
<p>Referenced Dimensions<br />The distance from the inside of one pod to the inside of the other is defined as the clear opening length, and the barricade is purchased on that basis. The clear opening is the largest width that can pass between the pods without touching them. The clear opening is typically about 12 inches [30, 5 cm] greater than the width of the roadway. The center to center distance of the support post centers is 36.69 inches [93, 2 cm] longer than the clear opening. For example, if a 144 inch [3, 66 m] Barrier was purchased, the center to center distance of the support posts will be 180.69 inches [4, 59 m].</p>
<p>The center of the beam's height above the roadway is 33.25 inches [84, 46 cm] though the weight of the beam and the chain will cause it to sag somewhat. This standard height will effectively block the main body of most of the vehicle classes which may constitute a typical security threat.</p>
<p>Application Notes<br />When designing an IP500 (H) or its variations into a roadway site, it is helpful to consider the following points:<br />1) The gate is purchased on the basis of the clear opening, which is defined as the inside dimension measured between the pods.<br />2) Make sure that there are no obstructions that will interfere with the path of the Crash Beam's swing; for example, power lines, trees, overhanging buildings, etc. Additionally, the ground underneath the pods must be flat, level, and stable.<br />3) Delta Scientific Corporation suggests that a layout be done of the actual site to examine the fit of the Barrier. The thought put into the layout can mean the difference between a successful installation and a poorly performing Barrier.</p>
<p>Delta Scientific Corporation welcomes your questions in regard to application of our products and we will be pleased to review any site drawings or make recommendations on the appropriate length and position of the Crash Beam Barrier.</p>
<p>Site Preparation and Pour</p>
<p>1) The first step of the IP500 installation is to fill the pods with concrete and allow it to harden. The pour can be done directly at the site of the installation or the pods can be filled remotely, allowed to harden, and then brought to the job site. If the pour is done at the job site, skip to steps 2, 3 and 4 below to position the pods before pouring. Before pouring concrete make sure that there are conduits in place for all hydraulic and electrical lines needed to operate the barricade and any optional equipment. The pods have no bottom, so they must be placed on a flat, smooth, and hard surface before the pour is attempted. Flat concrete or smooth asphalt is acceptable. Otherwise, the bottom of the pods will not be flat, or the wet concrete may squeeze out the bottom. Place a plastic tarp under the pods or coat the ground with a concrete releasing agent before pouring concrete. This will prevent the pods from bonding with the surface they are poured on.</p>
<p>2) Outline with a chalk line the location of the pods. Make sure the clear opening distance is correct. Also confirm that chalk outlines are aligned correctly. The distance between the pods and the alignment can be adjusted somewhat but be as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>3) Each module slots 3" x 8" [7, 62 cm x 20,32cm] slots which are designed to make the modules easy to move with a forklift. The anchor modules must be held from the side by a forklift and the weight modules must be held from the end. If the modules are set in place at the job site before the concrete is poured, it is better to use a concrete releasing agent instead of a plastic tarp to prevent bonding to the ground. If a tarp is used, it will cover the chalk lines, but the chalk should still be visible under a releasing agent. The anchor modules must be set in place first. Place the anchor modules in the chalk outlines made in step 2 above. The stop signs should be facing the protected side of the barricade. The hole in the hinge post ears should be offset away from the road. The claw shape of the latch post should be pointing away from the road. Once the anchor modules are in place, measure the clear opening to make sure it is correct. Also confirm that the modules are aligned with respect to each other.</p>
<p>4) After the anchor modules are set in place, the weight modules can be positioned. First, take the removable covers off the top of the weight modules. Near the end opposite the stop sign find the steel tubes. These tubes hold the drop pins that interlock the modules. Make sure the tubes are empty before moving the weight modules into place. Use a forklift to hold the module at the end with the stop sign. Line up the slots on the other end of the module with the interlock tabs of the anchor module. Gently move the weight module up against the anchor module, making sure that the interlock tabs go into the slots of the weight module. It is important to do this carefully to prevent moving the anchor module when positioning the weight module.</p>
<p>5) Remeasure the clear opening and check the alignment. If they are both still correct, place the drop pins in the tubes. The drop pins must reach the bottom of the tubes (the metal rings at the top of the pins should be just below the top of the tubes).</p>
<p>6) If pouring concrete at the job site, pour it and allow it to harden in the modules.</p>
<p>7) Replace the covers to each module.</p>
<p>8) Excavate and prepare suitable forms for the foundation base of the hydraulic power unit.</p>
<p>9) Trench for the hydraulic lines and any electrical conduits from the hydraulic power unit to the end support post assembly(s). Install the PVC ducting for the hydraulic hoses and all required electrical conduit from customer's control point(s) and the power disconnect to the Barrier.</p>
<p>10) Concrete notes and specifications (minimum requirements):</p>
<p>A) Contractor shall verify and be responsible for all dimensions and conditions at the job site.</p>
<p>B) Concrete shall be laboratory designed, machine mixed, producing 3,000 psi (20, 68 MPa) at 28 days.</p>
<p>C) Cement shall be tested Portland cement conforming to ASTM C150, Type I or II.</p>
<p>D) Aggregates shall conform to ASTM C33. Maximum size of aggregate shall be 1.5 inch (38 MM).</p>
<p>E) Concrete shall be conveyed from the mixer to final deposit by methods that will prevent separation or loss of materials. Troughs, buckets or the like may be used to convey concrete. In no case shall concrete be allowed to free drop more than 5 feet (1, 5 M). F) Concrete shall be thoroughly consolidated by suitable means during placement and shall be thoroughly worked around reinforcement and embedded fixtures and into corners of forms.</p>
<p>G) Concrete shall be maintained above 50&ordm;F [10&ordm;C] and in a moist condition for at least 7 days after placement. Adequate equipment shall be provided for heating concrete materials and protecting concrete during freezing or near freezing weather.</p>
<p>H) Conduits and pipes of aluminum shall not be embedded in concrete unless<br />effectively coated or covered to prevent aluminum/concrete reaction or electrolytic action between aluminum and steel.</p>
<p>I) Contractor shall be responsible for the protection of all adjacent areas against<br />damage and shall repair or patch all damaged areas to match existing<br />improvements.</p>
<p>J) Contractor shall keep the construction area clean at all times and at completion of work remove all surplus materials, equipment and debris and leave the premises in a clean condition acceptable to the owner or owner's representative.</p>

<p>4) If necessary, mount the lower end of the hydraulic cylinder using the clevis attachment point in the cylinder cabinet. Lock the clevis pin in place with the locking pin furnished.</p>
<p>5) If necessary, set bearing blocks on the yoke pivot shafts.</p>
<p>6) Set the yoke assembly (with bearing blocks attached) on the hinged end top plate. Loosely fasten the bearing block bolts (1/2"-13 x 1.5" long).</p>
<p>7) Remove the 3/4"-10 nuts and washers from the hinge end top plate and install the yoke safety retainer brackets. Re-install the 3/4"-10 nuts and washers (leave loose).</p>
<p>8) Place the tube locking collar around the crash beam with the positioning tab facing the<br />hinge end. Do not tighten the collar bolts until the tube is positioned in the yoke.</p>
<p>9) Lift the crash beam tube assembly containing the chain and latch pin and slide it into the yoke. It is necessary to start the loose end of the chain into the yoke.</p>
<p>10) If the hinge pin is not already installed, it should be installed now. Loosen one of the yoke bearing blocks and raise one side of the yoke to have clearance while installing the<br />hardened anchor pin. Insert the hardened 2 inch [5, 08 cm] diameter pin through the two<br />anchor ears and secure in place with roll pins. Lower the yoke and tighten the bearing block bolts. Connect the last link of the chain to the hinge pin with the second yellow two piece coupling. Unscrew the set screw in the collar at the center of the coupling and<br />remove the shaft. Place half the coupling around the hinge pin and the other half around<br />the last link of the chain. Reinsert the shaft through both halves of the coupling and the<br />collar. Tighten the set screw in the collar.</p>
<p>11) Check the position of the center of the bearing blocks relative to the center of the hinge pin. The hinge pin should be about 5/8 inch [1, 59 cm] further back (away from the road) than the bearing block center. The bearing blocks have slots that allow for some<br />adjustment. If necessary, loosen the bearing block bolts, move the bearing block, and<br />retighten the bolts.</p>
<p>12) With the crash beam in the horizontal position push the chain into the tube at the yoke end, so that a minimum of chain is exposed. Next insert the 3/4 inch [1, 9 cm] round cross pin through the hangers on the yoke and through the closest chain link. Tighten the set screws in the hanger. This is to minimize the amount of free chain exposed beyond the end of the tube.</p>
<p>13) Attach the upper end of the hydraulic cylinder to the mounting clevis on the bottom side of the yoke. Secure the clevis pin in place with the locking pin furnished.</p>
<p>14) With the Crash Beam in the full down position, check the side clearance between the<br />latching pin mounting box and the latching end posts. The box should be centered.<br />Note: If the box is not centered, with the four nuts securing the hinged end top plate<br />loose, swing the beam until it is centered on the latching post - then tighten the four<br />nuts.</p>
<p>15) With the crash beam in the full down position, check the clearance between the hardened latching pin and the latch posts. The clearance should be approximately 1/2 inch [12 mm]. This should be confirmed by raising and lowering the Crash Beam and insuring there is no interference in any direction.<br />If there is interference, the crash tube can be moved in or out or turned as required. Once the proper clearance is established the locking collar on the tube can be nested into the notch in the yoke and firmly tightened.</p>
<p>16) Grease the bearing blocks, actuator clevises and the chain at the points where the chain exits the crash beam. Use Shell Oil Company "Dolium R", Chevron "SRI No. 2" or Texaco Inc. "Premium RB" or similar.</p>
<p>17) Set the hydraulic power unit on the foundation, locate and drill for the anchor bolts. Caulk the base of the power unit enclosure to the foundation using a suitable RTV compound. Tighten foundation bolts.</p>
<p>18) Pull the hydraulic hoses from the hydraulic power unit to the hydraulic cylinder on the hinge post.</p>
<p>19) Pull any wires from the hydraulic power unit to the end support posts as required. Pull power and control wires to the hydraulic power unit.</p>
<p>20) Replace the hinge end support hydraulic cylinder access cover.</p>
<p>21) Touch up paint if required. Stripe the beam with the reflective tape if desired. Apply a thin film of anti-seize lubricant (compound) to any non painted or non plated carbon steel<br />surfaces (such as bearing blocks and exposed threads of fasteners).</p>
<p>Operation Notes</p>
<p>1) This barrier system is equipped with a descent control valve which is located on the lower fitting of the hydraulic cylinder. It will prevent the rapid descent of the crash beam in the event the hydraulic pressure line is ruptured or sabotaged. It has been factory set and sealed and should not be tampered with, nor should anyone attempt to adjust it. In the event of a problem contact the factory immediately for a calibrated replacement.</p>

SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONT-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
           We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data. The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010 with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2011.
	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical / engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified as integrated into the T-1 aircraft.

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">For the Assessment Center component, DEA annually conducts an Assessment Center in which eligible Agent candidates participate in exercises designed to examine a candidate's skills, abilities and knowledge of the job of a Supervisory Special Agent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Assessment Center is continually monitored and upgraded to ensure the skills being assessed are current with DEA's operational mission and to minimize or completely eliminate any adverse impact that the Center's testing mechanism may inadvertently impose.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Once both the PRS and Assessment Center portions of the test are received, they are combined to provide the candidate with a SAPP score in the range of 70 to 100 points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The scores of all Agents who participated in a SAPP are used to eventually determine the promotion band.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">DEA's promotion process, among other programs, is based on a job analysis of the GS-1811 series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to have the most accurate and efficient testing mechanism, the content on which it is based must be up-to-date and comprehensive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The last full job analysis on the Special Agent position was completed in June 2002 and must be revised and updated, as necessary, and incorporated into the assessment center exercises.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This revision of the promotion assessment center process for GS-1811-13 and GS-14 Special Agents will be updated based on "best practice" selection approaches and methodology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The revised process will be implemented operationally, and an evaluation will be conducted to identify areas for future improvements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the contractor shall conduct a new Special Agent job analysis and shall incorporate the findings into the assessment center exercises.</span></p>

This procurement is a total set-aside for SBA-certified small business concerns under the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) program only.  A separate solicitation will be made available within 30 days from the publication date of this notice.
This requirement is for the management of equipment and supplies owned by EPA Region 9, for use by its Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The contractor will be responsible for providing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week readiness of all materials and equipment in the warehouse in support of the EPA On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) and its environmental response contractor network.
