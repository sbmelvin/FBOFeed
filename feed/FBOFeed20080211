<DESC>The Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) in the Coordinating Office for Terrorism Prevention and Emergency Response (COTPER) in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to compete a requirement for laboratory support services for the Select Agent Programs to furnish educated, qualified, and trained personnel to provide technical and program support in select agent and import permit activities including support of laboratory inspection activities, records, management and control, data entry, regulatory support, and file management. It is anticipated that one contract will be awarded for a one-year base period plus four one-year option periods.

Public Law 107-188, The ?Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002,? requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in cooperation with the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), establish and enforce procedures for possession, use, and transfer of select agents.  Select agents are biological agents and toxins that are regulated under 42 CFR Part 73 that pose a severe threat to public health and safety.   The select agent regulations, 42 CFR Part 73, established requirements for facilities that possess, use, and transfer select agents. 

Currently, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) has been delegated by the Secretary of HHS to ensure compliance with the select agent regulations.  These regulations are implemented so that the select agents are available for legitimate research purposes, but inaccessible to potential terrorists.    To ensure compliance, CDC must inspect and evaluate entities using the requirements outlined in the select agent regulations and known biosafety standards such as the CDC/NIH (National Institutes of Health) publication, "Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories" (BMBL), 29 CFR 1910.1450, ?Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories,? and the ?NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules.? 

The Public Health Service Foreign Quarantine Regulations (42 CFR, Section 71.54) govern the importation of etiological agents, hosts, and vectors of human disease into the United States.  A person may not import into the United States, nor distribute after importation, any etiologic agent or any arthropod or other animal host or vector of human disease, or any exotic living arthropod or other animal capable of being a host or vector of human disease unless accompanied by a permit issued by the Director of CDC. 

The CDC Etiologic Agent Import Permit Program (EAIPP) located within the Division of Select Agents and Toxins is responsible for the issuing CDC import permits.  Information is submitted to EAIPP, as required by the provisions of 42 CFR 71.54, for issuance of permits by CDC to importers or distributors after importation of etiologic agents, hosts, or vectors of human disease.  To carry out this provision, EAIPP has developed two forms for application for a permit.  One form, the ?Application for Permit to Import or Transport Etiologic Agents, hosts, or Vectors of Human Disease? is used to request permits for the importation and subsequent distribution after importation of etiologic agents, hosts, or vectors of human disease.  The second form, the ?Application for Permit to Import or Transport Live Bats? is used to request importation and subsequent distribution after importation of live bats. Issuance of the CDC import permit is essential in protecting the public?s health by monitoring the importation of etiologic agents. 

Etiologic agents are those microorganisms that cause disease in humans and include bacteria, bacterial toxins, viruses, fungi, rickettsia, protozoans, and parasites. These disease-causing microorganisms may also be referred to as infectious agents. Infectious substances and biological materials, such as body fluids and tissues that contain them, are referred to as infectious materials. Organisms such as mosquitoes, ticks, or snails, that may transmit infectious diseases to animals, including humans, are called vectors.
 
Responses by Facsimile (Fax) will not be accepted. All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date. If not registered or active by that date, vendor proposals will be considered non-responsive.  It is anticipated that a solicitation for this requirement will be posted to FedBizopps on or after 2/26/2008.

Inquiries may be sent to the attention of the Contract Specialist: Kristopher Lemaster, Phone 770-488-2995, email Klemaster@cdc.gov.  If the Contract Specialist isn?t available, please call the Team Leader, Vivian Hubbs.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Region 5, is planning a solicitation for Boat Haulout Rehabilitation on Petit Manan Island, which is part of the Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge, Washington County, Rockport, Maine. This solicitation will use a multi-step technical evaluation/proposal process as outline in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 15.  The ultimate contract award will be based on a "Best Value Continuum". The project consists of the removal and off-island disposal of the existing boat haulout ramp and the construction of a new boat haul-out ramp on Petit Manan Island located off the coast of Maine. The project includes the removal and disposal of all demolition materials and debris from the Island.  Access to the site is difficult.  Access to the site shall be by boat or helicopter and will be weather dependent.  Access to the site will be based upon such factors as the tides, wind direction and velocity, wave action and height, etc.  Mobilizing and demobilizing to and from the site, off-loading of construction materials and removal of demolition materials and debris will  present challenges, coordination, scheduling and safety issues not typically found in general construction projects. The work also includes a requirement for contractor-furnished generators for electrical power and water for consumption and to complete all of the work at the Island.  Due to bird nesting restructions, the work required by this proposed contract may only be accomplished during two (2) specific time periods.  The work may start as soon as a Notice to Proceed is issued to the contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be completed by May 1, 2008; or the work may be started on or about August 15, 2008 and completed in the Fall. The estimated magnitude of construction for this project is between $100,000 and $250,000.  The NAICS is 238990.  This procurement is unrestricted.  As part of the first step, which is the technical evaluation process, interested firms shall submit, in writing, their qualifications based on listed requirements below and those determined qualified will be asked to submit a cost proposal (step two) in accordance with FAR 15.203.  Interested firms shall present a minimum of five (5) marine construction projects undertaken within the last ten years.  The following information shall be provided for each of these projects: 1) Project name; 2)  Original budget; 3)  Change orders; 4) Summary of work; 5) Date of completion; and, 6) Client name, address and phone number.  Qualification factors used for the evaluation of firms shall be; 1)  Past performance (40%); 2) Experience in conducting specialized marine construction work. (25%); 3) Ability to provide adequate equipment necessary to transport construction materials to and from the jobsite and overall approach to the project (25%); 4)  Ability to provide projects on time and within budget (10%).  Firms desiring consideration should submit two (2) copies of their resume (qualifications) and all other appropriate information as described above to: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 300 Westgate Center Drive, Hadley, MA 01035-9589, Attn:  Dale E.

<DESC>This is a market survey for Graphics Services Support for the Office of Communication Services. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense. This market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  In addition, we are soliciting responses from firms that are SBA certified 8(a).  Other respondents will not be considered. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS Code) for this effort is 541430 - Graphic Design Services, with a size standard of $5 million. The contractor will assist the FAA in carrying out its responsibilities for graphics services, including graphic design and layout for brochures, posters and other materials, exhibit design, brochures,  photography, high volume copying and printing and similar services.  The contractor must have previously, successfully performed services described in this statement of work at an organization of similar size and complexity. The FAA operates and maintains the most complex air traffic control system in the world. More than half of the world's air traffic is managed by the FAA.  We conduct research to improve aviation safety and efficiency and provide grants to improve almost 3, 400 eligible public -use airports in the United Stats.  FAA also regulates commercial space launch activities to ensure public safety.  To carry out its mission, FAA has a workforce of 45,416 and in FY07, an annual budget of $14.5 billion.   The Office of Communications is responsible for the policy direction and management of the Agency's communications programs, both internally and externally.  This includes responsibility for making sure major programs, policies, and achievements are effectively presented to employees and the public; and that all publications (print and electronic) and other materials visually convey a consistent and uniform look and style and are of high quality.  The Office of Communications provides graphics and media services to the Headquarters organizations and other FAA locations as requested; and manages the policy and standards for the Agency's brand identity and web management programs.   In April 2005, FAA reorganized its internal communications and public affairs activities by establishing the Office of Communications. This new office elevated the importance of internal communications with its employees, by designating a senior executive to lead the Agency's strategic internal communications and provide Agency wide leadership for web management and brand identity.  As part of the reorganization, the Office also acquired federal staff and contractor resources responsible for providing graphics, photography and media production services to the Headquarters offices.  At the time, there were two contracts in place for graphics and photography services support.  FAA seeks to improve the efficiency of providing these services and reduce the overall cost by procuring services from a single vendor.

<DESC>The US Forest Service is soliciting the following serivces for performance in the Carson and Bridgeport Ranger Districts of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.  The solicitation will be a Request for Proposals, which will be published here on or before 2/19/08.  Full original technical and pricing proposals will be due to the Contracting Officer, and a copy of the Technical Proposal only, (no pricing) will be due to the Carson Ranger District, all no later than close of business on 3/21/08.  

Services Sought:

1. Tree planting services to restore and reforest lands burned over after wildfire.  The purpose of this contract is to secure containerized tree planting services in a manner that insures tree survival and growth.  Tree survival and growth is dependant on the initial health of the tree seedlings, the manner in which trees are handled and planted, environmental conditions such as soil moisture and weather, and animal damage to the seedlings. The services secured with this contract will focus on the need to provide appropriate tree handling, care, and planting techniques during a period of time when environmental conditions are most favorable to insure tree survival.  The installation of shade tubes is included in this contract.

2. Pre-commercial tree thinning and stand improvement activities to reduce tree densities and, by the deliberate selection of leave trees, improve the overall health and condition of the stand based on the prescribed objectives.  Tree selection and cutting of undesirable or excess trees will provide space for the leave trees to grow and develop, reduce the incidence of insect and diseases that affect growth, and undesirable tree qualities.  The goal of this project is to thin dense stands of Jeffrey Pine regeneration and release the leave trees from brush competition.  Aspen stands recovering after a wild land fire will also be enhanced by removing conifers from within and around the stand, allowing the aspen sprouts to increase in number, size and acreage.   In some areas brush reduction activities will be used to reduce fire danger.

The Forest Service anticipates the award of a Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, (IDIQ) Contract to a single awardee.  The Forest Service reserves the right to award to multiple awardees if it desires, but is not bound to do so, and it is not the initial intent.

<DESC>Department of Energy to Compete Management & Operating Contract for its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Note: This is for informational purposes only and is not the formal RFP.  This site will be updated when the RFP is relesed.) WASHINGTON, DC â The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced that it will compete the management and operating (M&O) contract for its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, the nationâs primary laboratory for clean energy research.  The competition reflects DOEâs commitment to regularly compete its M&O contracts for DOE national laboratories to ensure the greatest possible benefit to DOE, its mission and this Nation. The current contract, which expires on November 8, 2008, was last competed in 1998. âNRELâs work, including research and development supporting President Bushâs Advanced Energy Initiative, is vitally important to increasing our nationâs energy security,â DOE Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Alexander A. Karsner said âHolding competitions for the management and operation of our world class national labs ensures that we have the best team managing the work and provides the best value for taxpayer dollars.â NREL conducts research, development, and deployment (RD&D) in alternative energy areas such as converting sunlight to electricity, generating electricity from wind, producing fuels and high-value industrial products from biomass, and producing and storing hydrogen fuel generated from renewable feedstocks. In addition to its RD&D activities, NREL, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center, provides DOE expert counsel on the scope and direction of DOEâs alternative energy and energy efficiency programs.  Established in 1977 as the Solar Energy Research Institute, NREL was renamed in 1991 to reflect its expanded mission and importance.  NREL has a staff of more than 1,000 and an annual budget of approximately $220 million. NREL is currently managed by the Midwest Research Institute (MRI), a not-for-profit research institution headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. More information about this competition will be posted, when appropriate, on Federal Business Opportunities website and on the DOE Industry Interactive Procurement System website.

This requirement will cause extensive disassembly of the aircraft wing structural components, and subcomponents, resulting in substantial out-of-commission times for the aircraft thus mandating that this requirement be bundled with the accomplishment of the aircraft?s normally scheduled annual inspection; to include the accomplishment of non-routine maintenance items identified by the maintenance entity during the accomplishment of the inspection.  Qualified vendors must be an approved vendor for the Beech (Raytheon) Aircraft Company.  Furthermore, vendors must be approved by the aircrafts original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to perform this main wing super spar replacement on aircraft in this age category, and must have possession of the required OEM engineer drawings showing allowable dimensions, clearances and tolerances of flight critical wing super spar components, and must possess the unique, tools, test sets, facilities, equipment, and jigs required for inspection accomplishment.  Qualified respondents to the impending solicitation must provide detailed and concise information in their own format and in sufficient detail for the Government to make a determination if they can be considered as a qualified source.  A Statement of Work and Technical Requirement/Work Package will be provided with the resulting solicitation.  The performance will be for a 3 month period from the date of award.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811310, with a size standard $6.5 million dollars.  The procurement will be a total small business set-aside.  Request for Quote (RFQ) No. DJMS-08-Q-0015 will be available on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) on or about 12 Feb 08 and responses will be due 19 Feb 08.

<SOLNBR>FA8726-08-R-0003
<CONTACT>Anh Le anh.le@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The Tactical Air Control Party Modernization Program seeks to design, develop, integrate, test, produce and prepare associated documentation, fabricate, integrate, test, provide logistic support, provide technical support, provide field service support as necessary, provide training, develop technical manuals and deliver the Vehicular Communications System (VCS). The U.S. Air Force (USAF) requires the capabilities provided by Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP) and their VCS components that support numerous critical functions across the battlespace.  TACPs advise the ground commander and staff on aerospace power capabilities and assist them in planning close air support (CAS) operations. TACPs provide USAF Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures expertise and a focal point for detailed air CAS integration with ground force fire and maneuver.  In order to perform their mission, TACPs must employ vehicle mounted communications systems, manpack radios, and digital communications devices that enable them to be interoperable with the Army Digitized Battlefield. The VCS, a subsystem of the overall TACP-M system, is the key element in providing mobile, on the move communication and data protocol interoperability required to effectively operate throughout the battlespace. Using different communications systems at the various ground force echelons and between various aircraft and C2 nodes requires the VCS to be equipped with communications capabilities that support multiple waveforms and data protocols. Although data operations are increasing on the battlefield, allowing for faster and more accurate mission execution, voice communications will continue to be required to augment and coordinate the data operations.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Radio Frequency Identification System

<RESPDATE>022608
<CONTACT>Doris Vaughn, Purchasing Agent, Phone 301-402-3351, Fax 301-480-3662, Email vaughn@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Office of Research Services (ORS), Division of Library Services (DLS) intends to procure a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) System.  

The contractor shall provide a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system that will make it possible to identify and track the Library?s collection of more than 185,000 books, journals and audiovisual materials; ensure security of library materials; efficiently inventory the collection; allow Library users to self-check out books automatically; provide ADA compliant sensor security gates: one double aisle and one single aisle; and provide excellent control of non-returns and misfiling of the books on the shelves. 

The RFID system shall include the following features to meet the NIH Library?s needs:  (1) read-write, ISO standard compliant tag with memory chip that identifies and tracks books; (2)  security chip added to the tag to protect the books from theft; (3) conversion station, that converts IDs from bar code labels to item identifiers on RFID tags, automatically dispenses tags, allows programming and reprogramming tag information; (4) staff pad workstation that allows staff to check-out/check-in books for library users and functions as conversion station; (5) ADA compliant RFID sensor security gates: one dual aisle and one single aisle, including software to identify unauthorized items leaving the library; (6) hand held reader for inventory control that can be moved rapidly across a shelf of books and journals to shelf read all the unique identification information, sort data, locate misplaced books and journals, and download data into the Millennium integrated library system; (7) SIP2 compatible patron self-check kiosks with touch screen computer, built-in RFID tag reader, and built-in receipt printer; (8) book drop that turns on security bit, removes the item from patron?s account, and returns item to circulation.    

In order for the Millennium integrated library system to read item identifiers from RFID tags to access the associated record in Millennium (for example, by a staff member using Millennium Circulation at the information service desk, or by a patron using Millennium?s Graphical Patron Self Check-Out software), and to maintain the ?security bit?, the RFID system shall provide the following functionality:

-Presents individual access to each workstation?s RFID read or write hardware as a TCP/IP accessible Web Service

-Presents such individualized access either by offering a unique IP address for each workstation?s RFID read or write hardware, or by hosting the software implementing the Web Service for a particular workstation?s RFID read or write hardware on the same workstation as the Millennium client application so that the TCP/IP loopback facility may be used for communication

-Support in the above described Web Service to deliver, in response to a request from Millennium, a list of individual item identifiers from RFID tags which are considered at the time of the request to be ?in range? of the RFID hardware, for example, in the case of a typical RFID ?pad? enclosure, the items which are currently atop the pad.  Additionally:

-Repeated requests to the Web Service should deliver the same data on subsequent requests if the same items remain in range
-Web Service should support (at a minimum) one request per second
-Web Service should be non blocking, providing an error response if it is unable to respond immediately to a request

-Support in the above described Web Service to accept ?circulation status change? events from Millennium which provide the item identifier and the then current circulation status, and take the following actions:

-Upon receipt of status change to ?checked out? for an item currently in range of the RFID hardware, clear the security bit
-Upon receipt of status change to ?checked in? for an item currently in range of the RFID hardware, set the security bit
-Upon receipt of status change for an item no longer in range of the RFID hardware, return an error indication

Sources demonstrating the capability to accomplish the above shall provide pertinent information that is in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform.  Information furnished should include enough material to conduct a proper evaluation.  Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results.  Quotations will be due fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this synopsis.

<DESC>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the Infrastructure Committee. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on the provision of helicopter matting and personnel duck boards.
 
This procurement is a subproject of Project 5HQ27010, Ancillary Equipment Required for the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF). The bidders list for this ICB will include registered firms identified from the NAMSA Source File as well as additional bidders nominated by NATO member nations in response to this Notification of Intent.

NAMSA intends to use the two-step ICB procedure. Partial bidding is not allowed. The estimated value of this project is Euro 1.46 million ($2.12 million). The reference for this Invitation for International Bids (IFB) is 5HQ27010-1B. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-5HQ-27010-1B.

Security Level Required: NATO UNCLASSIFIED 

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION:

The contractor will furnish to NAMSA helicopter landing matting, personnel duck boards or sidewalks, and vehicle and personnel utility crossings. These items, featuring portable, all weather, hard surfaces, are intended to provide clean, firm landing, loading, walking and crossing surfaces to users in rapidly deployable NATO military headquarters camps that may be deployed over a wide range of geographic environments and climatic conditions. Accordingly, NATO expects the equipment to be robust and of high quality, capable of being assembled and disassembled rapidly and often, under difficult climate and soil conditions. Matting and duck boards for two major headquarters camps (camps of 1000 occupants each) and 2 smaller remote sites will be required, all of which will operate independently, but which will feature interchangeable components.

The contractor will be responsible for the complete works, including the final design and the performance of the systems, the performance of all materials used within the contract, the adequacy of the logistic support programs, the system documentation, and the commissioning, test and validation program.

Major Components

General: Each of the two headquarters camps will have six 15m x 20m helipads, up to 3000 linear m of duck boards, up to 4 vehicle crossing sites, and up to 16 pedestrian crossing sites. The remote sites will each have one 15m x 20m helipad, 100 m of duck boards, and 2 pedestrian crossing sites.

Helicopter Matting: The helipads will be designed to carry CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The matting must be capable of being used by those or lighter helicopters; used as a loading area by accepting mechanical handling equipment and trucks across it; and be regularly cleaned by snow removal equipment, sand removing sweepers and power washing equipment. The helipads must be capable of carrying all of these loads when laid on roughly graded surfaces of rough, sharp and uneven subsoil that may have weak load bearing characteristics and be liable to freezing.

Personnel Duck Boards: The duck boards will act as personnel sidewalks around the camp and are not expected to be crossed by camp vehicles. They will generally be used in single widths and extended end-to-end although, on occasion, they will be connected laterally to form patios or personnel gathering areas. They will join at junction points and intersections. The duck boards must be capable of being cleaned by light mechanical snow and sand removal equipment such as bobcat type sweepers and snow blowers, and by power washing equipment. The duck boards must be capable of carrying all of these loads when laid on roughly graded surfaces of rough, sharp and uneven soil that may have weak load-bearing characteristics and be liable to freezing.

Utility Crossings for Vehicles and Personnel: Various utility conduits will be present at the camps, varying in size from 20 mm fibre optic cable to 200 mm sewage pipe. These utility conduits will run on the surface and must be protected from vehicle and pedestrian damage. Crossings capable of carrying up to 5 utility conduits each are required. They will be installed assuming the same soil and strength characteristics as the helipads and duck boards. The crossings must be capable of connecting to the helipads and duck boards, or to be firmly anchored when butted up to them, to prevent movement between the two when they are used together.

Climatic and Geographical Conditions

Climatic and geographic conditions are based on Allied Environmental Conditions and Test Publications (AECTP) 200/3 for the range of A1 to C1 Climatic Zones. The equipment described must be capable of remaining functional under these environmental conditions. The proposal shall specify how the proposed product meets these conditions by providing evidence that the proposed equipment has been successfully tested or used in the extreme environmental and climatic conditions that apply to the zones specified. 

The proposal shall provide specific procedures on how to deal with the following environmental conditions: The equipment, when anchored, shall support steady winds of up to 31m/s and shall remain safe under gusts up to 52m/s coming from any side. Particular attention must be paid to anchoring against helicopter updraft. Ice accumulation shall not damage or prevent the equipment from functioning.  

Installation

All proposed equipment shall ensure fast and easy unpacking, assembly, disassembly and re-packing by soldiers with limited training and minimum supervision. In general, all components should be capable of being installed without the use of any special tools or accessory equipment. Where special tools are required, they should be identified in the proposal, be included in the bid price, and be provided by the contractor.

Transportability

All loose material will be transported in containers (supplied by others) that will meet the structural specifications normally associated with standard sea freight containers. Shipping containers shall have overall (outside) dimensions of 6058 mm ISO containers. The gross weight shall not exceed 14,000 kg when ready for transport. Size of the containers will be 6058 mm x 2438 mm and will meet ISO 668 specifications. Note the limitation in height when compared to the normal 2591 mm high normal shipping container.

Integrated Logistics Support

To minimize in-service support costs, NAMSA requires the contractor to conduct an Integrated Logistics Support program as an integral part of system design and development. This integrated program shall ensure that logistics support matters such as equipment reliability, maintenance, sparing, and training are considered in the development of the proposal and in the design and production of the equipment. The Integrated Logistics Support requirement is achieved through the identification of equipment failures, the identification of component reliability, and the development of an optimum sparing, maintenance, and training program that minimizes life cycle costs and achieves the expected operational availability. It is supported by documentation and data, all of which are related through the NAMSA information management system.

The Integrated Logistics Support requirement remains applicable for both the COTS equipment and the purpose-built equipment, although the tasks and analyses are expected to be tailored to recognize the maturity of the equipment.

A 30-day spare parts package and a training package shall be identified by line item and included in the firm fixed price. A critical 2-year parts list, additional spare parts, contractor assisted maintenance, and depot level maintenance shall be priced and shall not be included in the firm fixed price. All other Integrated Logistics Support items shall be included in the firm fixed price.  

An explanation of the Integrated Logistics Support program is required in the contractor proposal.

Please note that actual quantities to be included in the IFB may vary slightly from those specified in this announcement.

BIDDING PROCEDURE

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the contracting agency for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already identified as potential sources from the NAMSA Source File, firms must be nominated to the bidders list with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The NATO contracting agency will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms. Firms added to the bidders list will be contacted directly by the NATO contracting agency when the IFIB has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 19 February 2008

2. Intended date for distribution of the IFIB package: not before 25 February. Bidders will be allowed not less than 42 days to reply. 

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD. The bids to be received in response to the IFB will be valid for a period of 180 days. 

4. Anticipated contract award date: TBD

5. Expected delivery date: Not later than 6 months after contract award.

<DESC>The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute?s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) is seeking an organization to provide assistance in specific areas of its extramural Program, with particular emphasis on the functions of the network of action/decision points committees that guide the progression of potentially useful anticancer agents through the entire preclinical drug discovery and development process.  The activities of the DTP Program extend from the acquisition and input of new natural and synthetic materials into the system through the initial and secondary evaluations and subsequent preclinical development phases leading to approval for Phase I clinical trials.  The scientific disciplines involved include chemistry, biology, pharmacology, toxicology and the pharmaceutical sciences, and technical expertise in the management of computerized databases.  The Contractor will have access to proprietary information on compounds acquired by the NCI and the Contractor shall be required to treat all information obtained under this contract as strictly confidential.  The Government will provide the Contractor with guidelines governing this requirement. In the performance of these services, an adverse drug reaction or event may require an immediate response by the Contractor.  It is essential that the Contractor be capable of providing such an immediate response, which generally should be approximately one hour.  The Contractor's facility must be located in close proximity to the committee meetings in the Rockville, Bethesda area to facilitate such an immediate response. Since this contract involves the use of information on commercially, confidential compounds, pharmaceutical and chemical companies are excluded from participating.

It is anticipated that a single level of effort award will be made for a five-year period of performance with incremental funding each year.  Offerors will be invited to submit proposals for 5,800 direct labor hours annually for Years 1 through 5.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA has a requirement for the EPAs Office of Research and Development (ORD), Immediate Office of the Assistant Administrator (IOAA).  As part of its efforts to ensure the credibility of Agency-generated data, EPA has adopted, as policy, the requirement that all Agency laboratories maintain a documented quality system that, at a minimum complies with the requirements of EPA Order 5360.1 A2 (2000) and contains the specific components listed in the Agency Policy Directive, Assuring the Competency of EPA Laboratories, February 23, 2004 (i.e., hereby referenced as the Laboratory Policy). One aspect of the Laboratory Policy is that all Agency laboratories must seek accreditation where an appropriate program is available, and have periodic external (i.e., non-EPA) assessments for those program areas which are not covered by accreditation.  The work conducted by Agency laboratories covers many different scientific functions (e.g., environmental chemistry, biology, microbiology, geology).  Given the fact that accreditation programs are not currently available for all of the types of measurement work that Agency laboratories are engaged in, many of our laboratories will employ the assessment option. The objective of this solicitation is to provide IOAA with assessment services to those EPA laboratories that do not become accredited to implement and determine compliance with the Laboratory Policy.  The Government anticipates award of a cost plus fixed fee term (LOE) contract with a twelve-month base term and four (4) twelve month options to extend the term.  The base level of effort for each term will consist of 2,100 direct labor hours. The Government anticipates including quantity option amounts of 200% for the Base and the option periods, which brings the maximum total potential on the contract to 31,500 direct labor hours over five (5) years.   The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis; it will not be a small business set-aside. Copies of the solicitation will be available to all offerors on the Internet at the following website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the RFP. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA. The anticipated solicitation release date is late February and the close date shall be approximately 30 days thereafter.  Contract award will be made in accordance with Far Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The NAICS code is 541330, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of 6.5 million maximum annual receipts.  The point of contact for this procurement is Matthew J. Growney at 513-487-2029.  See Note 26.

Dear prospective offerors:

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in the West Bank and Gaza intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP), to implement the program described below. 

The scope of this solicitation is to obtain the services of multiple US Construction contractors to implement Task Orders directly or through sub-contracting or both for the construction, rehabilitation of roads, transportation infrastructure, buildings, water, wastewater, health facilities, schools, and other infrastructure works that USAID may specify and describe.  

Task Orders issued under this indefinite quantity contract will provide for the construction of new and the rehabilitation of existing regional infrastructure, including primary and secondary roads, bridges, water transportation networks, wastewater treatment and reuse, government office buildings, schools and clinics, electrification, sports facilities, warehouses, food storage facilities, and other critical infrastructure.  All work to be undertaken under the contract will be authorized in the form of Task Orders.  Each Task Order will be competed and issued separately.

-	Other civil works: The Contractor may be required to construct/rehabilitate other infrastructure facilities that will be identified later and infrastructure needed for success of USAID programs in WBG.

The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (http://www.fbo.gov/). In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data error resulting from this transmission.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Ryan Daniels, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-6476
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and under the authority of FAR 13.1, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued under Request for Quote RFQ-DC-08-00089 and includes incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-23. The  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334519 with a Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of 500 employees.  OBJECTIVES:   The required sources are intended to be used for the calibration and calibration checking of instruments used to  measure samples for radioactivity in two separate fixed laboratories at different geographic locations somewhere within the United States or its territories.  Each laboratory will receive ten sources consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma emitters in various geometries as identified in the  specifications. Separate quotations are requested for each Item 1 through 7, or for combinations of these Items.  Separate contracts may be awarded for each Item, if it is determined that this will provide the greatest value to the government. The specific locations where the equipment is to be  shipped and installed have not yet been determined.  EPA will therefore perform receipt inspection at the vendor's facilities when manufacture is complete.  The inspection may be performed either in conjunction with, or after, factory testing by the vendor, at the vendor's discretion.  This  inspection by EPA will include verifying the functionality and interoperability of all components being provided by the vendor, and therefore must be performed with the equipment fully assembled and prior to packaging.  The vendor will be responsible for packaging the equipment for temporary  storage and/or shipment after the equipment is accepted by EPA. If EPA has not yet determined the final locations for the equipment at the time of receipt inspection, the vendor will be required to provide temporary storage of the equipment for up to 6 months for Items 1 through 7.  The vendor's  monthly demurrage fee for providing temporary storage, if any, should be quoted separately as Items 8 through 14. For Items 1 through 7, separate fixed price quotations are requested for shipment to a destination within the 48 contiguous states, identified as Items 15 through 21.  In the event  that EPA chooses one or more locations that are not within the 48 contiguous states, a separate contract or a contract modification will be negotiated for the additional shipping costs. The specifications below are believed by EPA to be necessary to meet the functional requirements for the  intended application, but alternatives will be considered provided that bidders can demonstrate how a proposed alternative will meet the functional requirements.  General Requirement applicable to Items 1 through 7  1.	All radioactive standards must meet the requirements of ANSI N42.22 for  traceability to an appropriate national standards laboratory, such as NIST (ANSI 1996a). 2.	Documentation provided with equipment shall include certificates of assay showing traceability of the source.  This documentation may be provided either in printed form, or on a CD-ROM in portable document  format (PDF) files. Item 1 - Multi-isotope Alpha source 1.	Source to consist of approximately 100 dpm each of Am-241, Pu-239, U-238, and U-234 2.	Radioactive material to be deposited homogeneously onto a stainless steel 25 mm flat planchet 3.	Active source diameter of planchet is to be  approximately 20 mm centered to the planchet Item 2 - Single isotope, Th-230, Alpha source 1.	Source to consist of approximately 1000 dpm of Th-230 2.

AETC CONS/LGCT , AFCESA Support Flight, 136 Barnes Avenue, Building 856 Annex, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403 is soliciting competitive offers for Air Force Utilties Privatization  Robins AFB, GA Electrical Distribution System.  Anticipated release of RFP for this effort is on/around 14 Mar 2008. 

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. ?2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a description of the system to be privatized:

Robins AFB receives electric power from GPC through three 115-kilovolt (kV) transmission lines that feed into the GPC switching station, which in turn supply power to the Base-owned substations at Ninth Street and Milledgeville Street. At the Ninth Street and Milledgeville Street substations, the 115-kV power is reduced for 12.47-kV distribution on Base by two 25.5-megavolt-ampere (MVA) transformers owned by GPC. The power is then fed into the Robins AFB substations? main bus structure, which provides power to the feeder breakers. The on-Base power distribution system is monitored and controlled by a SCADA system, which is not included with the electric distribution system being privatized. Robins AFB will not use the SCADA system after privatization to operate or control any system components without prior coordination with the Contractor. Robins AFB will work with the Contractor to institute necessary system safeguards and coordination procedures.
At the Milledgeville Street Substation (also referred to as Substation D), the power is distributed to the Base through eighteen 15-kV, 1,200-amp General Electric vacuum circuit breakers. The distribution feeders travel from the substation as underground circuits consisting primarily of 500-million circular mils (MCM) copper conductors in concrete-encased ductbanks, with final load taps made up with predominantly #2 copper conductors.
At the Ninth Street Substation, the power is distributed to the Base through eight 15-kV, 1,200-amp General Electric vacuum circuit breakers. The distribution feeders travel from the substation as underground and overhead circuits. The underground circuits consist primarily of 500-MCM copper conductors in concrete-encased ductbanks or directional boring conduits and final load taps made up with predominantly #2 copper conductors. The overhead circuits consist of both aluminum and copper conductors.
The electric distribution system consists of 3-phase, 4-wire underground and overhead circuits. Each circuit consists of three conductors with a concentric neutral. All circuits are looped to provide redundant capability to facilities.  Underground circuits are buried in concrete-encased ductbank, with an average burial depth of approximately 2 feet below ground surface. Overall, approximately 17 percent of the distribution system is underneath paved surfaces. Also included with the system are medium voltage (4,160 V) secondary circuits that feed directly into high-voltage equipment, including motors, chillers, boilers, etc. This does not include the circuit feeding the PAVE PAWS/CT plant downstream of GPC Substation No. 3.
No cathodic protection equipment is included with the electric system to be privatized. The POD is the line side of the disconnect switch closest to the rectifier. The disconnect switch is not included with the electric system subject to privatization.
Robins AFB has excavation restrictions in portions of the Industrial Area due to contamination of subsurface soils and groundwater from spills, leaks, and other releases that predate regulatory restrictions.  This restricted excavation area houses machine shops, metal finishing, industrial waste treatments plant and associated underground piping, industrial materials storage, and drummed waste storage facilities.  Implementation of the remedy selected in the Excavation Plan for the Industrial Area is required in order to ensure the protection of personnel coming into contact with the site and to eliminate or minimize risk associated with the contamination.  This area of the Base is 84 percent paved, behind security fencing, under building foundations, or beneath streets.  There is very limited potential for exposure to workers, visitors, or trespassers in the area.  The most likely scenario in which exposure to contaminated soils might occur is in the event of maintenance or construction activities requiring excavation of affected soil. Maps of the area and a copy of the Excavation Plan for Industrial Area will be supplied in the Technical Library.  
	Robins AFB?s ability to distribute electric power is essential to its mission and security. A high emphasis is placed on the Base?s ability to operate and maintain its electric distribution system without interruption, and in the event of an outage, to quickly return the system to service. For example, to ensure uninterrupted service to mission-essential facilities, it may be necessary to enter energized utility manholes to perform system maintenance and emergency repairs. Degraded or interrupted electric service will negatively impact the ability of the Base to meet its mission and productivity requirements. 
Robins AFB also has the ability to generate its own electrical power. There is approximately 28 megawatt (MW) of generator capacity, of which, approximately 18 MW can be fed back into the system. There are two 3.3-MW diesel generators located on Base at the PAVE PAWS site. These generators provide emergency startup power to the GPC Turbine Plant.  On a monthly basis, all Robins AFB-owned generators are periodically run tested.  The Contractor will be notified prior to operation in every instance.  None of the Base?s generators, the CT plant, or the associated transmission lines connecting these sites to GPC Substation No. 3 are included with the electric distribution system being privatized.
Robins AFB has a contract with GPC to receive a capacity credit for peak shaving. The Contractor will be required to support the Base?s program and not negatively impact the capacity credit that can be earned by Robins AFB.
	Key facilities projects planned for Robins AFB will increase the total square footage of buildings on Base and the resulting electric demand. However, the electric distribution system has the capacity to meet a demand of 90 MW with the existing transformers. To reach this level would require a demand increase greater than 50 percent over current levels. Should the requirements of the electric distribution system increase to current capability, it would be relatively easy to replace the existing transformers with larger ones. The individual feeder circuits are also more than capable of meeting large increases in demand. The average feeder carries less than 3 MW and is capable of carrying 10 MW.

AETC CONS/LGCT , AFCESA Support Flight, 136 Barnes Avenue, Building 856 Annex, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403 is soliciting competitive offers for Air Force Utilties Privatization  - Robins AFB, GA Natural Gas Distribution System.  Anticipated release of RFP for this effort is on/around 14 Mar 2008. 

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. ?2688 ? Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a description of the system to be privatized:

Natural gas is supplied to Robins AFB at three locations through pressure-regulation and metering stations. One pressure-regulation and metering station is owned by AG&L and the other two are owned by the City of Warner Robins. The AG&L-owned regulator station is located adjacent to Richard Ray Boulevard, west of Building352 . The City of Warner Robins-owned regulator stations are located on the northwest side of the intersection of Ninth Street and Page Road and west of Building 675, west of Laundry Drive. 
Natural gas is received from the suppliers and reduced to approximately 55 to 60 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) for distribution throughout the system on Base. Odorization is provided by the suppliers. There are no government-owned odorization facilities associated with the natural gas system included in the solicitation. The system supplies natural gas to residences and facilities for space heating and cooking, hot water, steam boiler requirements, and industrial process equipment. It also supplies the compressed natural gas fueling station, which is used to supply the Base?s alternative-fuel vehicles. The distribution system is looped so that nearly all locations/buildings can be fed from at least two different paths. There are approximately 130 buildings and 760 housing units connected to the system.
The Base operates a propane/air-peaking system, which includes twelve 60,000-gallon propane storage tanks, that can be used to supplement or curtail the use of natural gas supplied from off-base sources. The propane/air-peaking system is not included with the natural gas distribution system being privatized. The Robins AFB-owned propane/air-peaking system is located on Marchbanks Drive.
The original sections of the gas system were constructed in the 1950s. The original gas system piping consisted of black iron and steel pipe. Portions of these pipes were abandoned in place and replaced with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe. New construction is generally HDPE pipe. Standard installation practices are to install tracer wire or tape with plastic piping; however, it is not known if all plastic piping was installed with tracer wire or tape. The Contractor should not include any projects to install tracer wire on piping in their proposal. Any requirements for tracer wire will be addressed after contract award.
The distribution system piping consists of approximately 177,652 linear feet of pipe. Materials of construction include coated and wrapped steel, black iron, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and HDPE. More than 50 percent of the system is of an unknown material type, but is likely to be coated and wrapped steel. Approximately 40 percent of the system is non-metallic. Piping ranges in size from ? inch to 8 inches in diameter. The burial depth for buried infrastructure is between 2 and 4 feet below ground surface. Approximately 10 percent of the distribution system is underneath parking lots, pavements, roadways, etc. The steel piping systems are protected from external corrosion by an impressed current cathodic protection system. A total of five rectifiers are installed throughout the Base to protect the metallic natural gas piping. 
Ten district regulator stations  further reduce the natural gas supply pressure throughout the distribution system. Nine of these district regulator stations are included in the Utilities Privatization solicitation of the natural gas distribution system. The other district regulator station (Turner Housing Regulator Station), located approximately 50 yards southwest of the intersection of Turner Parkway and Twelfth Street, is owned by the Housing Privatization Contractor and is not included in the Utilities Privatization Solicitation. The stations are typically above grade and are protected by concrete-block walls or fencing. The regulator stations are designed in a self-monitoring configuration to provide pressure regulation and over-pressure protection. The regulator stations also include a bypass loop to allow for continued operation in the event of a regulator failure. Eight of these regulator stations, including the Turner Housing regulator station, reduce the pressure to approximately 35 psig to serve the housing areas. 
There are numerous small, single regulator installations that reduce the pressure to the desired service pressure for end device use, such as boilers, stoves, and heating units. Typical gas pressure for equipment and appliance use in buildings is 7 inches of water to 1 psig. A few buildings are served at higher pressures, such as 5 psig or higher, for boiler or process equipment use. Gas meters are installed throughout the distribution system and are used for internal billing and energy management purposes. 
Robins AFB has excavation restrictions in portions of the Industrial Area due to contamination of subsurface soils and groundwater from spills, leaks, and other releases that predate regulatory restrictions.  This restricted excavation area houses machine shops, metal finishing, industrial waste treatments plant and associated underground piping, industrial materials storage, and drummed waste storage facilities.  Implementation of the remedy selected in the Excavation Plan for the Industrial Area is required in order to ensure the protection of personnel coming into contact with the site and to eliminate or minimize risk associated with the contamination.  This area of the Base is 84 percent paved, behind security fencing, under building foundations, or beneath streets.  There is very limited potential for exposure to workers or visitors in the area.  The most likely scenario in which exposure to contaminated soils might occur is in the event of maintenance or construction activities requiring excavation of affected soil. Maps of the area and a copy of the Excavation Plan for the Industrial Area will be supplied in the Technical Library.  
The City of Warner Robins supplies gas directly to the Museum of Aviation. This remote facility is metered separately and is not included with the natural gas distribution system being considered for privatization. The point of demarcation for the distribution line supplying the Museum of Aviation is the downstream side of the meter.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Tekran Model 3310 Elemental Mercury Calibrator
<SOLNBR>SB1341-08-RQ-0089
<RESPDATE>022608
<ARCHDATE>03122008
<CONTACT>Kim Stavish, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-2672, Email kstavish@nist.gov - Todd Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Tekran Instruments Corporation, Toronto, Ontario, for the purchase of a Tekran Model 3310 Elemental Mercury Calibration Unit.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  On March 15, 2005, EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) to permanently cap and reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.  This rule makes the U.S. the first country in the world to regulate mercury emissions from utilities.  The Analytical Chemistry Division at NIST has been working with EPA since August 2003 to develop standards and a traceability protocol for Mercury Monitoring, and to technically evaluate the performance of the mercury generator units that will be used to meet the terms and requirements of CAMR for traceability.  The Tekron Model 3310 Calibrator, along with one other calibrator, are the only two mercury generators that are presently qualified by the EPA to be used in the project.  In the future, both units will be used as reference standards.  However, the Tekran 3310 Elemental Mercury Calibration Unit has been selected by the EPA as the unit to be used as the reference standard for the Mercury Stack Monitoring Traceability protocol.  Tekran Instruments Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the system that is required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by February 26, 2008, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SOLNBR>W911W6-08-R-0006
<RESPDATE>032808
<ARCHDATE>05272008
<CONTACT>Wilma Estrada, 757-878-5003
<DESC>Using the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct applied research and development in the following two topics of interest: Topic 1  Durability  and Damage Tolerance (D&DT) and Topic 2  Rotorcraft Airframe Technology (RAT). The proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein. This Announcement  constitutes the only solicitation. BACKGROUND: Current Army r otorcraft operate above structural design gross weight and incur significant Operating and Support (O&S) costs. Rotary Wing Vehicle (RWV) structures require maintenance due to environmental damage, battle damage, and limited service lives which limits airc raft availability. Future Army rotorcraft systems require improved range, payload, durability, and survivability for high operating tempo (OPTEMPO). To address these problems, investments in rotary-wing Applied Research will be directed to the D&DT and RAT  topic areas, which address the following Structures Technology Objectives: reduced structural maintenance labor, reduced parasitic weight, reduced manufacturing cost, increased structural efficiency, and increased accuracy of stress and internal load pred iction. The link at http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/docs/ASSP_Structures_TOs.ppt contains the Aviation S&T Strategic Plan (ASSP) 2005 - Joint Services VTOL Rotorcraft. The Plan contains specific technology objective metrics for 2010/15/20 and technology ba seline definition. This BAA is limited to 6.2 Applied Research and is used to solicit effort needed to advance the technology readiness levels (TRLs) of rotary-wing compatible technologies sufficiently for follow-on 6.3 Advanced Technology Demonstration or  commercialization. Efforts under this BAA are expected to develop and mature promising technologies from a TRL-3 (analytical and experimental critical functions and/or characteristic proof of concept) to a TRL-4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment). The Integrated Aircraft & Crew Protection (see http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/docs/IAC_CP.ppt) and Capability-Based Operations & Sustainment Technologies (see http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/docs/OSST.ppt) programs are likely 6.3 transition opportunities for sufficiently mature technologies. SOLICITATION TOPICS: TOPIC 1  D&DT: AATD seeks proposals to reduce structural maintenance via corrosion sensors and improve structural efficiency via an integrated D&DT methodology. Specifical ly, efforts to mature and evaluate corrosion sensors are desired for those rotorcraft structures that are difficult to inspect or are inaccessible. Impact to the structure and aircraft, such as size, weight, and wiring needs, will be considered in evaluati ng the proposed concepts. Efforts to validate an integrated methodology to design a rotorcraft structural component using D&DT criteria are also desired. Significant work has already been done to develop the foundation technologies (e.g., damage detection,  damage growth models, regime recognition, damage tolerance criteria, and life prediction techniques) in this area; however, an integrated methodology to use these technologies and techniques for structural qualification does not exist. Offerors should def ine the current TRL for each supporting technology, quantify the potential benefits and costs, and establish a D&DT qualification methodology. Proposed D&DT methodologies, validation strategies, and potential improvements in weight and maintenance cost wil l be considered in evaluating the proposed concepts. TOPIC 2  RAT: AATD seeks proposals to develop and mature structures technologies that improve structural efficiency via high-strain capable structural concepts, increase confidence in stress/load predic tion via high strain-rate analysis methods, and reduce parasitic weight via conductive composite structural concepts. Specifically, high-strain (approx. 5000 ?i n/in) capable structural concepts are desired to save weight in primary structure through maintaining structural integrity at strain levels beyond current practice. Validated structural response models and simulations for high strain-rates (approx. 1000 in /sec) are desired to increase confidence in stress/load prediction under crash and ballistic impact events. Conductive composite structural concepts are desired for multifunctional structures that incorporate some or all of the following attributes: broad- spectrum antennae, EMI shielding, and lightning strike protection. Offerors should clearly justify the applicability of any proposed technology to rotorcraft structures. EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD: The selection of one or more sources for award wi ll be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to o ther proposals submitted under this announcement. Each proposal will receive an adjectival rating supported by narrative. The adjectival ratings and supporting narrative will be considered along with other factors including the extent of restrictions place d on technical data deliverables that limit the Governments ability to further exploit the results of the research and cost to the Government. The Government will develop an order of merit list for each topic. The following evaluation criteria apply and a re of equal importance. 1. The extent to which the proposed technology satisfies the topic objectives by use of innovative, efficient, and affordable solutions to the technical problem. This includes understanding of the problem, current technical barriers , and how the proposed solution overcomes those barriers. 2. The merit of the proposed approach to develop and demonstrate the capabilities of proposed technologies. This includes the reasonableness of the proposed tasks, schedule, and approach to accompli sh the scientific and technical objectives. 3. The capability of the Offeror to accomplish the proposed effort. This includes the experience and qualifications of the proposed personnel, the suitability of the proposed facilities, and the availability of ( or the ability to generate) required technical and test data to validate the technology. 4. The reasonableness of the proposed cost to the Government. This includes the realism of the proposed man-hours, materials, travel and other costs to accomplish the proposed effort. Any proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art. 5. The risk of the proposed effort. This includes an assessment of the technical, schedu le, and budget risk associated with the proposed effort. DATA DELIVERABLES: All awards will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Management Plan, (2) Bi-Monthly Cost and Performance Progress Reports, (3) Final Report, (4) Final Briefing at Ft.  Eustis, and (5) Briefing Charts. The following data deliverables will be required as applicable: (6) Test Plans, (7) Test Reports, (8) Software Development Plan, and (9) Software Requirements Specification. Contractor format will be acceptable. SECURITY R EQUIREMENTS: Unclassified, subject to export controls. Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data, the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 et. seq.) or the Export Administrat ion Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50 U.S.C. App 2401 et seq. Prior to award, the successful Offeror(s) will be required to provide an Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25. This certifica tion may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FBA Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI  49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572. DATA RI GHTS: The Government desires, at a minimum, Government Purpose Rights (defined at DFARS 227.71), to all technical data and computer software to be delivered. The proposal shall clearly acknowledge or take exception to the Governments desire for Government  Purpose Rights. DESIRED PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Topic 1 (D&DT): 12-18 month efforts are desired; however, efforts should not exceed 24 Months total (21 technical plus 3 for Data/Final Report); Topic 2 (RAT):  the period of performance should not exceed 15 Mon ths total (13 technical plus 2 for Data/Final Report). EXPECTED AWARD DATE: Staggered awards beginning 4th quarter FY08 are anticipated. ANTICIPATED FUNDING: Anticipated funding for all awards by each topic is as follows: TOPIC 1 (D&DT)  FY08 (414.0k), FY 09 (921.0k), FY10 (1,584.3k); TOPIC 2 (RAT)  FY08 (847.8k), FY09 (709.9k). To adequately invest in each topic area and maximize the breadth of technology developed, multiple awards within each topic are anticipated.

The Governmen t intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the electric and gas distribution systems for the Air National Guard Station (ANGS) located at Fresno Yosemite Airport, Fresno CA, to Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E).  Privatization is defi ned as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  PG&E (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to pr ovide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility sy stem.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contra ct.  The electric and gas systems being privatized are described as follows: The 144th Fighter Wing (FW) of the California Air National Guard occupies two separate parcels of land (the main base area and the Munitions Storage Area) totaling 110.726 acres o f leased land on the Fresno Yosemite International Airport, located approximately 4 miles east of downtown Fresno, California.  The mission of the 144th FW is to provide air defense protection for California from the Mexican border to Ukiah utilizing the F -16 Fighting Falcon jet fighter aircraft. The 144th FW occupies 7 administrative, 16 industrial and 2 services buildings totaling approximately 3490 square feet with 325 full-time personnel.  A unit training drill is conducted once a month and results in a  surge of up to a total of 990 personnel.  Electric power is provided by PG&E and enters the base and is metered at one location. It is delivered and distributed at 12.47 kV through a radial underground system with multiple dead-end branches. The primary d istribution system of the main base area consists of 8,900 linear feet of 3-phase underground circuits rated at 15 kV. There are no primary circuits in the Munitions Storage Area. The underground circuits are in ductbanks buried at an average depth of thre e feet and are marked with warning tape.  Multiple branches feed 15 three phase pad mounted transformers ranging from 75 to 750 kVA. The system includes 14 switches, 13 manholes, three electrical handholes and 18 meters.  Base personnel indicate the capaci ty of the current system is adequate for present and future needs.  Natural gas service is provided by PG&E and enters the base at three points. There are two separate systems: the main base area that is metered at two locations and the Munitions Storage A rea (MSA), which is metered at one location.  Both systems are branched configurations with multiple dead ends.  Natural gas is delivered at 5 psig. The two distribution systems contain approximately 3,500 linear feet of PVC pipe, 2,300 linear feet of blac k iron pipe, 1,400 linear feet of steel pipe, ranging from one to four inches in diameter. Pipes are buried at an average depth of three feet and are marked wit h tracer wire. The systems contain 13 PE ball valves, 14 meters and 13 regulators.  Base personnel indicate the capacities of the current systems are adequate for present and future needs.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2002 and no offers were re ceived.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002 .  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering  into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the em ergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>Interested sources shall contact T Sgt Cheryl A.

<DESC>Program Objectives and Description:
The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) announces interest in research and development of persistent airborne Close Air Support (CAS) of ground Troops in Contact (TIC).  The area of interest includes new ideas and innovative approaches to rapidly mature proven technologies to a production readiness state, as well as applications of existing COTS-NDI solutions that may be integrated onto an existing airframe.  Operational considerations include austere fields, small support crew, minimal aircrew, low weight and drag.  Primary interest is in the following areas, listed in descending order of priority:
Fire Control Systems (Integrated-Stand Alone)
Battle-Mission Management
Integrated Air-Ground Picture (IAGP):
Cooperative Engagement Capability    
- Sensor Correlation-Evaluation
- Simulation and Modeling
- Command, Control, and Communications
- Network Centric Operations
- System Interoperability
- Other Applicable IAP Technologies
- Data, Sensor, Display Fusion  
Day-Night and Active-Passive Sensors
Target Identification-Recognition 
Weapons-Warhead Accuracy-Lethality
Precision Guided Munitions, Launchers
Guns, Mounts
Human or Machine Interface 
Communications (Local, Global)
Other applicable technologies

Teaming is encouraged.  An offeror may submit more than one concept aligned with the technologies listed above.  Responses are requested from any responsible US organizations including those from private industry, academic institutions, research institutions and non-profit organizations.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by USSOCOM.  

Responses:  Interested parties are invited to submit a white paper for preliminary consideration.  White papers may be submitted at any time after issuance of this BAA up to the expiration date of the BAA.  Successful responses should segment their studies into an initial 8 month or shorter Phase 1 to explore and validate the technical feasibility of the concept, and one or more additional phases as optional efforts culminating in technology demonstration.  The total effort including options should not exceed 24 months.  Successful initial phases will have a greater likelihood of receiving funding for subsequent optional phases.

Format: The form and format for white papers follows below.  White papers that do not satisfy these form and format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation.  All submissions should be in the English language.  White papers should be submitted electronically; a paper copy is not required. Electronic copies should be in PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word.  

White Paper Preparation: A white paper should be a brief summary.  It introduces the idea, solicits interaction with government, and avoids the expense of generating proposals that have little likelihood of selection or award within this BAA.  White papers should summarize the planned proposal and clearly articulate the innovative concept or technology development and demonstration being proposed.  White papers should contain a cover sheet (clearly marked White Paper), a ten page (maximum) summary of the technical idea, a one-page cost summary, and a one-paragraph (150-200 words) abstract of the white paper as a whole.  All pages should be printable on 8.5 by 11 inch paper; type not smaller than 12 point.  The page limitations for white papers include all figures, tables, and charts.  No formal transmittal letter is required.  White papers shall not include classified information. 

WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION WITH PROPRIETARY DATA: When an offeror must include proprietary data in order to fully communicate their concept, the offeror must clearly mark and identify any proprietary data that the offeror intends to be used only by the Government for evaluation purposes.  The offeror must also identify any technical data contained in the white paper that it is furnishing to the Government with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure.  In the absence of such identification, the Government will assume to have unlimited rights to all technical data in the white paper.  Records or data bearing one of the DFARS-approved restrictive legends may be included in the white paper.  It is the intent of the Government to treat all white papers as privileged information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.

The offerors are cautioned, however, that portions of the white papers may be subject to release under terms of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.

NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor, which is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by USSOCOM from non-Government consultants and experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Non-Government technical consultants will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as GOVERNMENT ONLY. Evaluations and selections under this BAA will be made only by Government evaluators.


Submittal address: All white papers should be sent electronically to:  Maj Brady Hauboldt, USSOCOM, SOAL-FW, (813) 826-9390, brady.hauboldt@socom.mil.  White papers received by USSOCOM but not submitted specifically to the BAA may not be considered under the BAA.

Evaluation and Notification: Acknowledgment of receipt of all white papers will be made. White papers will not be returned.  White papers will be evaluated based on the relevance to the SOF mission.  The initial screening will minimize unnecessary effort and expense in any subsequent proposal preparation and review.  Favorable response to a white paper is not an assurance that a full proposal on the white paper's topic will ultimately be selected for contract award.  

Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the technology objectives rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.  The following factors are to be considered in the evaluation of white papers received under this BAA.  Listed in descending order of importance: 1) potential contribution to CAS-TIC mission; 2) likelihood of transition to the military if technically successful; 3) offeror's capabilities and related experience, including qualifications and achievements of all team members and their key personnel, their capability to carry out further development and production, and the adequacy of facilities and equipment to be used for the proposed effort; 4) overall scientific and technical merit including degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational issues, and demonstration approach; 5) project plan; and 6) cost and cost realism.  All proposals must first be deemed acceptable under criteria (1) to receive a full technical review.  

The BAA will remain open for submissions for 12 months from the date of posting.  Submissions received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated.  USSOCOM will review and respond to each white paper on a quarterly basis; however reserves to right to review and respond as submissions are submitted.  Upon completion of the evaluation, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has merit and will be considered for award as funds become available, or 2) the proposal does not contain sufficient relevance to the SOF mission to be of interest to the command.  

Awards: Funds are currently available for multiple awards.  An invitation to submit a full proposal will be made to offerors on the basis of the white paper evaluation criteria above and program balance to provide best value to the Government.  Awards will be subject to the availability of funds.  Award instruments may take the form of a procurement contract, grant, or agreement depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  All work beyond Phase I shall be submitted as options.  An estimated cost for options beyond Phase I must be included or the options will not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to 1) select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received, and 2) incrementally fund any award instrument.  All awards made as a result of this BAA will require the awardee to deliver a final technical report (as a minimum) at the end of the contract and or options.  The government will have unlimited data rights to all information and  products generated under contracts that result from this BAA.

Classified Submissions: White paper and proposal submissions in response to this BAA should be kept UNCLASSIFIED.  If classified information is expected to result from any contract, the offeror shall notify USSOCOM in the white paper or proposal.
  
Organizational Conflict of Interest:  Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any government technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then the offeror shall so state in the affirmation.

Administration: USSOCOM will reply to questions relating to this BAA and will make replies to questions of general interest available to prospective offerors.  All correspondence including questions and requests for access to the replies to the questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to one of the addresses below.  USSOCOM prefers to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding this BAA.  The address for this BAA are: EMail:  brady.hauboldt@socom.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of modification 2 is to correct the days of the week associated with the response dates.

February 7, 2008

I. 	Requirement

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has a requirement for Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) investigation services. These investigations pertain to employee complaints related to employment discrimination and are governed by Title 7, and as such, timeliness and thoroughness are critical to meeting the government?s statutory responsibility to resolve these matters in an expeditious manner. The complete statement of work (attachment 1) and all attachments can be downloaded at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/index.htm.	 All documents will be available at the aforementioned site by COB February 8, 2008.

The USPTO is soliciting quotes in accordance with its Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG), following simplified acquisition procedures similar to those set forth at FAR 13.5 for acquisitions of commercial items not in excess of $10 Million. The PTAG can be seen at http://www.ustpo.gov/web/offices/ac/compt/proc/acquproc.htm.

The solicitation number is OCRBPA004, and is issued as an RFQ. This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside. The NAICS code is 561611 and the associated small business size standard is $11.5M.  

II.	Instructions

Interested quoters are requested to provide pricing in the format provided (see attachment 2) Quoters shall also provide three past performance references and contact information. The contact information shall include the company/agency name, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and email address (if possible). 

Past performance references should be for worked performed within the last three years  The USPTO will  contact the references provided but is not limited to these reference in assessing past performance. The USPTO will use all information reasonably available to it to assess past performance.

Experience should list the company/agency for which the quoter has worked, duration of assignment, and the exact nature of the work performed. 

Quotes must be received by on or before Tuesday, February 19, 2008 at 10:00 a.m. Questions should be addressed to Chris Harris (via email to Chris.Harris@uspto.gov), and must be received by 12:00 p.m. on Thursday, February 14, 2008. Questions received after this may not be entertained.



III.	Evaluation

The USPTO will issue multiple BPAs. The total value is estimated to be $300,000 per year. Pursuant to FAR 16.702(C)(2) the government only estimates, but does not guarantee, the volume of purchases made through these agreements will be $300,000 nor is the government obligated to place orders with the BPA awardees. The USPTO anticipates issuing firm fixed priced BPA calls. 

The awarding of BPAs will be on a best value basis. The determination of best value will be made considering the following evaluation factors: experience, past performance, and price. However, we reserve the right to do telephone interviews.


The vast majority of the requirement pertains to individual cases with one or two issues; therefore, the evaluated price will consist of the sum of the 5 year average of Individual Cases?one issue and Individual Cases?per additional issue.


IV.	Post Award Administration

The USPTO will either rotate or compete the requirements. However, if the work of a company is found to be sub par and therefore unsatisfactory, the USPTO reserves the right to work with only the contractor or contractors that have satisfactory performance.



V.	Provisions & Clauses

The following FAR provision and clauses are applicable to this acquisition and are hereby incorporated by reference as if they were stated in full text. Quoters may access the full text of these provisions/clauses at http://www.arenet.gov/far.

Sources Sought Synopsis announcements are issued to assist the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in performing market research to determine industry interest and capability, obtain company demographics, benchmarking information and industry ideas for an acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is not a request for proposal and at this time, no solicitation exists.

Introduction:  The Agency's mission is to safeguard the United States and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate and counter the threat and its effects.  This mission dictates a diverse set of customers and unique mission requirements.  The Agency's Information Technology (IT) requirements are therefore equally diverse and unique.  DTRA is seeking interested sources capable of providing integrated IT services and support for the DTRA IT environment. 

Background:  The DTRA Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for ensuring that IT capabilities are acquired and information resources are managed and maintained in a manner that supports the Agency's mission consistent with Federal and Department of Defense guidance.  This entails developing, maintaining, and operating an integrated set of IT capabilities, services and processes across all functional areas of the Agency.  IT support requirements within DTRA are extremely diverse, ranging from office automation and business/mission system support to sensor integration.  

In the past, the broad range and diversity of the Agency IT support requirements, in addition to other factors, led to a "stovepiped" and fractured IT infrastructure.  The CIO, teamed with the DTRA IT support contractor(s), is committed to developing the necessary governance, processes and oversight required to effectively integrate IT services across the Agency.

DTRA recently consolidated the majority of its personnel and IT infrastructure within the Defense Threat Reduction Center (DTRC) located at Fort Belvoir, VA.  The current infrastructure provides IT services and support for over 2400 employees and contractors.  In addition to the DTRC facility, IT services are provided to several smaller field offices in the National Capitol region, eight Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) remote sites within the U.S., the DTRA Albuquerque office and four overseas offices.

The DTRA IT infrastructure encompasses three principal security domains: Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU), Secret, and Top Secret/ Sensitive Compartmental Information (TS/SCI).  In addition, the CIO supports numerous mission and business systems in addition to collaboration capabilities.

Requirements:   DTRA intends to acquire services and support for its IT environment from a contractor(s).  The Agency requires the provider(s) to integrate the current IT environment into a centrally managed enterprise system capable of providing 24/7/365 IT functional support to all DTRA facilities, both CONUS and OCONUS along with providing built-in capabilities to address future enhancement, modernization and technology changes.  Potential sources will be required to satisfy organizational conflict of interest requirements.

The following provides a list of IT services and support that DTRA seeks to obtain.  These services will be performed to support all of the Agency's developmental, operational, and business system networks at all classification levels from Unclassified to TS/SCI.

Sources must possess "core competencies" in the area of IT Infrastructure/Services/Systems Integration support.  Sources must demonstrate experience and ability to provide an adequate number of cleared personnel (up to and including TS/SCI) and IA certified personnel at both CONUS and OCONUS locations.

THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool to determine potential sources and interested parties for an intended procurement.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized and posted at http://ideasec.nbc.gov. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.

<DESC>36 CONS is seeking the interest of potential and eligible contractors in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Andersen AFB, Guam and other federal government locations throughout the Marianas Islands.  Responses are due no later than 15 calendar days after publication of this synopsis.  The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design.  Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 - Construction, Subsection 236 - Building Development and General Contracting - size standard $31 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities;  Subsector 237 - Heavy Construction - size standard $31 Million and Subsector 238 - Special Trade Contractors - Size standard $13 Million. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades.  Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  Individual task orders may range between estimated $200,000 - $5,000,000, but may be less or greater.  The program value is Not-to-Exceed $100,000,000 over a five-year period.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.  The government may award as many as 3 - 5 contracts.  The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference.  The RFP will identify a seed project which will be awarded to the highest rated offeror for the first award.  All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.  The government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees.  This acquisition is being considered for Section 8(a) set-aside, partial HUBZone set-aside, unrestricted competition, or a combination of these. In responding to this sources sought synopsis, please indicate your interest as a prime contractor, teaming partner, joint venture, primary subcontractor and indicate where your business is 8(a) and/or HUBZone certified, large, or small and provide evidence of  recent (within three (3) years), relevant (multiple trade, multiple task order) experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers and a statement as to why the project is relevant, and; (d) availability of bonding of at least $10,000,000 (maximum anticipated for each performance period) for this project.  
An actual solicitation is expected to be issued in April or May 2008.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov at that time.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov./ in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov.
Prospective offerors who would like their company name included on the Bidders Mailing List (planholder's list) may do so on the fedbizopps website under IVL (Interested Vendor's List).

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopcom.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. MARKET SURVEY ? SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND:  Announcement N00164-06-R-4897 was released to determine potential sources for a Weapon Shot Counter (WSC) compatible with the Carl Gustaf (CG) M3 Recoilless Rifle.  Very limited requirements were presented in the announcement.  The purpose of this announcement is to expand upon those requirements for the WSC-CG and develop dialogue with industry and academia to refine those requirements.       OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this announcement is to release a draft performance specification for WSC-CG with the intent to elicit comment from industry and academia to help further shape the specification before solicitation.  The Closing Date for receipt of comments on the draft WSC-CG performance specification is Tuesday, 11 March 2008.   PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE:  To further enhance communication between industry and Government, NSWC Crane will be holding a pre-solicitation conference.  This pre-solicitation conference is tentatively planned to be held in March 2008 at NSWC Crane, Indiana.  Blocks of time will be reserved for individual vendors, allowing for greater clarification of requirements and verbal communication of issues.  Discussions will include requirement background information, technology readiness, and questions and answers.  Attendees must register for this conference with the Contracting Officer no later than Tuesday, 11 March 2008.  No additional attendees will be accepted for this conference after Tuesday, 11 March 2008, in order to accommodate the arrangements at the conference site.  Specific time and date of the conference will be available before the close of this announcement.         PARTICIPATION:  This announcement is a public invitation.  Failure to participate in the pre-solicitation conference or provide written feedback to the draft performance specification will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.  This announcement is part of the full-, free-, and open- competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to participate in this open pre-solicitation conference or to provide written feedback may result in a future Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with contracting officials and acquisition planners. ADDITIONAL NOTES:  It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Weapons System Technology Integration Center (WSTIAC), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), and other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.   This announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U. S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest is this program is appreciated. Questions should be directed to Ms. Stacy McAtee, Contracting Officer, Code 0562NS, telephone 812-854-1988, fax 812-854-5095, e-mail stacy.mcatee@navy.mil.

Background:  The DTRA Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for ensuring that IT capabilities are acquired and information resources are managed and maintained in a manner that supports the Agency's mission consistent with Federal and Department of Defense guidance.  This entails developing, maintaining, and operating an integrated set of IT capabilities, services and processes across all functional areas of the Agency.  IT support requirements within DTRA are extremely diverse, ranging from office automation and business/mission system support to sensor integration.  

In the past, the broad range and diversity of the Agency IT support requirements, in addition to other factors, led to a "stovepiped" and fractured IT infrastructure.  The CIO, teamed with the DTRA IT support contractor(s), is committed to developing the necessary governance, processes and oversight required to effectively integrate IT services across the Agency.

DTRA recently consolidated the majority of its personnel and IT infrastructure within the Defense Threat Reduction Center (DTRC) located at Fort Belvoir, VA.  The current infrastructure provides IT services and support for over 2400 employees and contractors.  In addition to the DTRC facility, IT services are provided to several smaller field offices in the National Capitol region, eight Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) remote sites within the U.S., the DTRA Albuquerque office and four overseas offices.

The DTRA IT infrastructure encompasses three principal security domains: Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU), Secret, and Top Secret/ Sensitive Compartmental Information (TS/SCI).  In addition, the CIO supports numerous mission and business systems in addition to collaboration capabilities.

Requirements:   DTRA intends to acquire services and support for its IT environment from a contractor(s).  The Agency requires the provider(s) to integrate the current IT environment into a centrally managed enterprise system capable of providing 24/7/365 IT functional support to all DTRA facilities, both CONUS and OCONUS along with providing built-in capabilities to address future enhancement, modernization and technology changes.  Potential sources will be required to satisfy organizational conflict of interest requirements.

The following provides a list of IT services and support that DTRA seeks to obtain.  These services will be performed to support all of the Agency's developmental, operational, and business system networks at all classification levels from Unclassified to TS/SCI.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Cell-Free Assembly of NanoLipoprotein Particles
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Cell-Free Assembly of NanoLipoprotein Particles

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering an opportunity to license a new method of cell-free self-assembly of nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) as a platform for expressing functional membrane proteins along with a colorimetric assay based on bacteriorhodopsin (bR) that indicates  direct  incorporation of functional  membrane protein.

Background:  Membrane-associated proteins and protein complexes account for roughly one-third of the cellular proteins. These protein complexes mediate essential cellular processes such as signal transduction, transport, recognition, and cell-to-cell communication. This class of proteins is difficult to study because of their insolubility and tendency to aggregate when removed from their  protein-phospholipid lipid bilayer environment. Also, over-expression of membrane proteins in vivo often results in cell toxicity, protein aggregation, mis-folding and low yield. 

Description:  LLNL has developed a novel process of production, isolation, characterization, and functional re-constitution of membrane-associated proteins in a single step. In addition, LLNL has developed a colorimetric assay that indicates production, correct folding, and incorporation of  bR into a soluble nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs). 
?	LLNL has developed  an approach, for formation of NLP/membrane protein complexes by simultaneous co-expression of both apolipoprotein and target membrane protein in a cell-free protein synthesis system. This approach involves cell-free transcription/translation technology adapted to co-express both apolipoproteins and a target membrane protein.  It is carried out in a single reaction chamber with cell extract, buffer, phospholipds, detergents and the like to facilitate stabilization; the entire process can be complete in a few hours. 
Advantages:    
?	Cell-free protein synthesis technology allows simultaneous expression of apolipoproteins and membrane proteins leading to self-assembly of nanolipoprotein particles containing soluble and functional proteins within a stable membrane mimetic. .
?	Cell-free method  of simultaneous co-expression of both apolipoprotein and target membrane  can be achieved in a single step.
?	Process can be completed in a few hours .
?	Increase yields of stable, soluble and functional membrane proteins for downstream characterization.
?	Membrane proteins are expressed rather than purified from cellular sources.

Commercial Uses: 
?	Rapid production of novel functional membrane proteins that are difficult to obtain from native systems
?	Process screening of parameters for evaluation of production of membrane proteins
?	Medical diagnostics, therapeutics, biofuels


Development Status: LLNL has used cell-free expression for single step production and refolding of the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin. This unique approach has been demonstrated by the co-expression of a truncated apolipoprotein and the bacteriorhodopsin gene, which resulted in a functionally active seven trans-membrane helix spanning  bacteriorhodopsin protein containg co-factor  retinal. In addition, LLNL has developed a colorimetric assay that indicates production, correct folding and incorporation of bacteriorhodopsin into soluble nanolipoprotein particles. 

LLNL has filed provisional patent applications on these technologies. 

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

Special Notices to Offerors

a) The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government.  Proprietary information submitted in response to this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended (41 U.S.C 423) (hereinafter referred to as the "Act") as implemented in FAR.

b) Upon receipt, all responses to this RFP become Government property.

Submission of Complete Proposals
Offerors are cautioned to strictly comply with all instructions within this solicitation to ensure submission of a complete proposal.  Failure to furnish a complete proposal, at the time of proposal submission, may result in the proposal being unacceptable to the Government and elimination from consideration for award.

Proposal Format and Submission Instructions
Deadline for Receipt of Proposals is COB 02/29/2008. Offerors assume full responsibility for ensuring that their proposals are received by the due date and time. Each proposal shall consist of two volumes:

-	Technical Capability, electronic or original to include all data and information required for evaluation, and exclude any reference to the pricing aspects of the offer and shall include the following:
  
Factor 1. - Technical Approach 
Factor 2 - Scenarios (Attachment B)
Factor 3 - Qualification/Resumes of Key Personnel Proposed

-	Past Performance, electronic or original copies to include all data and information required for evaluation, and exclude any reference to the pricing aspects of the offer.  
	
-	Price Proposal, electronic or original to include the completed solicitation documents. Price evaluation will be conducted to determine if the price is fair and reasonable.

General Information - Submission of Proposals (Best Value)
Offerors are cautioned that the quality of their proposal and adherence to solicitation response requirements and/or restrictions are considered reflective of the manner in which the Offeror could be expected to conduct services and will be given due consideration throughout the evaluation process. Offerors are cautioned that failure to provide all the required information may make the offer unacceptable and may result in elimination of the Offeror from further consideration award.

Technical Capability submissions are limited to the maximum number of pages in length of 20. This limit does not include Factor 3 - Qualification/Resumes of Key Personnel Proposed, however, each resume should not exceed two pages. Each "page" is defined as one sheet, 8 1/2" x 11", with at least one inch margins on all sides, using a font with a point size of 12 points or greater with no more than 15 characters per inch (e.g. "Times New Roman" style with 12 point font).  Lines shall, at a minimum, be single spaced. Pages shall be consecutively numbered.  Multiple pages, double pages, two-sided pages, and foldouts will count as an equivalent number of 8 1/2" x 11" pages.  

Past Performance submissions are limited to the maximum number of pages in length of 10.  Each "page" is defined as one sheet, 8 1/2" x 11", with at least one inch margins on all sides, using a font with a point size of 12 points or greater with no more than 15 characters per inch (e.g. "Times New Roman" style with 12 point font).  Lines shall, at a minimum, be single spaced. Pages shall be consecutively numbered.  Multiple pages, double pages, two-sided pages, and foldouts will count as an equivalent number of 8 1/2" x 11" pages.  

The cover sheet, table of contents (not to exceed one page per section), tabs, and dividers will not count toward the page limit. The price proposal is not page limited.  However, the price proposal is to be strictly limited to price information. The price proposal should also be separated from the Technical Capability and Past Performance section of the proposal. 

Evaluation Factors

The OCC will use the following factors to evaluate proposals in accordance with FAR 12.203 and FAR 15.304.  Technical capability is more important than past performance, but when combined technical capability and past performance are significantly more important than price.


1.	 Technical Capability

Technical capability ensures that the vendor is capable of fulfilling the OCC's solicitation requirements.  The OCC's assessment of technical capability will focus on the following:

        1)	Technical approach in accordance with the Statement of Work, focusing on potential tasks contained in 3.2.1-3.2.7 of the SOO. 
        2)	Scenarios (attachment B) 

        3) 	Qualification/Resumes of Proposed Key Personnel(as provided in resume format)

2.	 Past Performance

	1) For offerors without a record of relevant past performance, they shall not be rated favorably or unfavorably on past performance pursuant to FAR 15.305.

Offerors shall identify three contracts that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance.  Recent is defined as within the last five years.  Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity, scope, and magnitude to the work identified in the Statement of  Work. Offerors who present similar contracts shall provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts to the requirements of the solicitation.  The offeror must provide the following information regarding its past performance:

		a) Contract Number(s);
		b) Name and phone number of a point of contact at the Federal, State,
		 Local Government or commercial entity for which the contract was performed;  
        	c) Dollar value of the Contract;
        	d) Detailed description of the work performed;
	        e) Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any and a description of the extent of work performed by the subcontractor(s); and
                f) The number, type and severity of any quality, delivery or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken and the effectiveness of the corrective action.

See Attachment D for past performance form.  The forms must be returned by the same due date as the offer.  OCC reserves the right to accept late past performance documents.

3. 	Price

Firm Fixed price cost proposed as well as fully burdened labor rates for the labor categories listed under the second section of the Price Schedule, will be the basis for price evaluation.

Determination of Best Value

The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose responsive proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria above. The best value tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101 -1 permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or the highest technically rated proposal. 

To be responsive the offeror must address all the requirements of the solicitation and must include all information specifically required in all sections of the solicitation. The offeror must state how it will meet the requirements; repeating back the words of the RFP or responding with product sales literature is not acceptable. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions; therefore, each initial offer shall contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  If the Government decides that discussions are necessary, the CO may establish a competitive range of the most highly rated proposals.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  

The failure of an Offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement of the RFP may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and thus eliminated from the competition.  The realism of rates will be part of the proposal evaluation.  Unrealistic rates and pricing solutions, as determined by the Contracting Officer, will be considered in the risk assessment and may result in a reduced score. OCC will award a contract to the Offeror of a proposal that is judged, by an integrated assessment of all of the evaluation factors, to be the best value to the Government.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
                                                    Commandant (G-A)

The Government may choose between the set-aside Contractor and the non-set-aside Contractor in placing any particular order. However, the Government shall allocate successive orders, in accordance with its delivery requirements, to maintain as close a ratio as is reasonably practicable between the total quantities ordered from the two Contractors.  Alternate IV (Oct 1995).

The Government may choose between the set-aside Contractor and the non-set-aside Contractor in placing any particular order.

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

Current OTI country programs include: Colombia, Lebanon, Liberia, Nepal, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Venezuela, and West Bank/Gaza. OTI country programs are designed and managed in Washington, with substantial input and oversight from field-based staff.  OTI annually operates ten to twelve country programs on three continents with an average budget of $100 million and 90 staff in Washington and in the field.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled employees make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.

The DCHA/OTI Program Office provides OTI with strategic guidance on country-level and office-level budgeting, strategy, and program performance issues, and increases key stakeholder awareness of and support for OTI as a key instrument in carrying out U.S. foreign policy objectives. The Program Office maintains technical oversight of the Support Which Implements Fast Transitions (SWIFT) II IQC and the Programming Development Quickly (PDQ) IQC, and manages coordination of programming within the Foreign Assistance (F) framework. The Program Office plays a key role in the initial country assessment process, periodic country program and management reviews, and final evaluations. The Program Office also provides support to ongoing country programs through managing country budgeting decisions and allocation of resources, and setting standards and providing guidance on strategic planning, decision-making, and implementation. In addition, the Program Office provides reports on country activities for DCHA, OMB, Department of State, and Congress.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to fund and employ a Team Leader to oversight and manage OTI's Program Office in support of transition assistance programming. The Program Office Team Leader will be based in Washington, DC, is a member of the Office's Senior Leadership Team (SLT), and will report to the Deputy Director of DCHA/OTI or his/her designee. The Program Office is comprised of at least 5 U.S. Personal Service Contractor (USPSC) employees. OTI estimates that 70% of the workload for the Team Leader will be in direct support of program development and implementation, and 30% of the workload will be in support of strategy design and evaluation of program impact.  

The Program Office Team Leader leads, manages, and directly supervises OTI's Program Office, which is responsible for all aspects of DCHA/OTI's program strategy, budget planning, program development, program review and evaluation, and strategic outreach and communications. The Program Office provides expertise and technical support to both OTI Washington and to all country programs, and promotes consistent program design, planning, evaluation, and reporting that will improve the effectiveness and impact of OTI programs in transition and post-conflict countries.  

The Team Leader must be an individual with proven leadership skills, sound judgment, excellent analytical, writing and communication skills and a well-developed understanding of U.S. foreign policy interests and the role transition programming can play in the mitigation of conflict and the development of democracy. The incumbent will have supervisory management and budget planning experience. S/he must have experience working for, or closely with, USAID or another USG office in the field.  A sound understanding of USAID's operational processes in Washington is also vital to the position. The incumbent must be articulate and able to represent OTI in various forums, meetings and seminars.

The Program Office Team Leader must have the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority while exercising sound judgment. The individual performs under general administrative discretion, with wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.

The incumbent must be able to resolve critical problems and define unknown conditions to a variety of audiences.

OBJECTIVE

The objective for this position is to ensure USAID/DCHA/OTI's Program Office is managed effectively in Washington and engages appropriately with the field programs, to ensure US government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practice, and USG policy.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product support.
7.	Contractor must be knowledgeable about current health care policies regarding privacy.

TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING/MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY: Technical capability shall be evaluated to determine whether the offeror clearly demonstrated technical experience, technical understanding, and approach to this project as it relates to the requirements of the SOW.  The Government will assess whether the offeror clearly described its capability to provide effective and efficient services necessary to successfully complete the SOW tasks within the specified period of performance. The Government will evaluate the suitability of the offeror?s proposed solution for the tasks and assess the quality of the solution, likelihood of the solution?s success, inherent risk, methodology for approaching the solution, and overall understanding of the requirement.  Resource information, such as data concerning material, subcontracts, assignment of labor hours to labor categories, etc., will be evaluated for its appropriateness to the overall requirement. The Government will also evaluate the offeror?s management approach and procedures for managing and controlling the performance of the tasks and providing quality control to ensure that all tasks are completed in a timely and satisfactory manner.

RELEVANT EXPERIENCE: The Government will evaluate the offeror?s recent and relevant experience in performing tasks related to the SOW.

Documented experience submitted by the offeror must be recent and relevant to requirements and tasks outlined in the SOW.

PAST PERFORMANCE: The Government will evaluate the offeror?s recent and relevant past performance in performing tasks related to the SOW. The offeror will be evaluated on the quality of its past performance on similar work, including overall customer satisfaction, cost control, timeliness of performance, and effectiveness at successfully accomplishing stated goals.

PERSONNEL:  The Government will assess the offeror?s personnel qualifications, experience related to the SOW and suitability of the offeror?s management and technical personnel who will coordinate closely with the Government?s COTR.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 1 is to answer questions.

Question:
There seems to be a conflict of words in your RFQ. A shirt can not be 100% polyester and 100% cotton at the same time?

Answer:
The following is provided to clarify.
Current Solicitation states incorrectly:
Fabric: shall be either 100% polyester with x-eede moisture control and anti-microbial technology, weight: 7.25 oz. per square yd. Must feature a 100% smooth cotton fabric that is very soft to the touch, will not shrink, wrinkle or fade and easily accepts embroidery or imprinting. An equivalent fabric or design is acceptable.

Solicitation is amended to read:
Fabric: shall be EITHER 100% polyester with x-eede moisture control and anti-microbial technology, weight: 7.25 oz. per square yd. OR the polo shirt must feature a 100% smooth cotton fabric that is very soft to the touch, will not shrink, wrinkle or fade and easily accepts embroidery or imprinting, OR an equivalent fabric or design is acceptable.

Question:
Is delivery in bulk or will individuals be ordering as needed against an open contract?
Answer:
This requirement is for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. It is anticipated that the first order on this contract will be for the entire minimum for each shirt for the base period; after that, orders will be made as needed.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, i the basic elements of the proposed cost or price.  These elements will include labor/personnel costs and items of other direct costs (e.g. materials, subcontracts, travel, etc.).

4.	Provide a breakdown of labor hours, rates, and other direct cost by appropriate category.  Key personnel will be identified.  Give the basis for the estimates for each category.

5.	Vendors must submit one original and three (3) copies of their respective Quotations.

6.	The vendor may submit comparable information on all subcontractors that are proposed to perform a subcontract under this RFQ.

7.	The vendor may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts/awards and corrective actions taken by the vendor.

8.	Any quotation which fails to address all technical portions of the solicitation will be deemed non-responsive.

Questions/Answers

Any and all questions related to this RFQ should be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Patricia Haun electronically to haunp@mail.nih.gov  no later than 3:00 PM local time, Thursday, September 6, 2007.  Upon receipt of questions, the Government will provide all vendors with answers to all the questions submitted. 


Evaluation Factors for Award

General
Award of an order will be made to the vendor whose quotation is determined by the Government to represent the best overall value.  





Technical Evaluation 
The technical portion of your quotation is significantly more important than cost or price and will be receive paramount consideration for award.  The technical portion of your quotation will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria outlined below under ?Technical Evaluation Criteria?.  

The Government will evaluate the quality of the vendor?s past performance based on the information obtained from references provided by the vendor, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the vendor concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.

Technical Evaluation Criteria for Proposal

Please refer to the table at the end of this section for the scoring scheme that will be used to evaluate all proposals.  

A.	Security (17 points)

Provide a secure environment for patients to enter/download data and for patient-clinician communication.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the vendors experience in constructing secure websites for handling confidential data. 

B.	Blood Glucose Meter Data Download (17 points)

The vendor will be judged on experience with downloading data from multiple BG meters.  

C.	Website Design (17 points)

Provide clear and usable graphical interfaces for data entry by patients. Data includes numeric measurements and textual communication.  Proposals will be evaluated on general web programming experience and clarity in previous projects. Preference will be given to proposals demonstrating experience in diabetes-related clinical trial data.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product support.
7.	Contractor must be knowledgeable about current health care policies regarding privacy. 

Project Deliverables
a)	Plan of Action
b)	Key processes flowchart
c)	Training resources for the staff
d)	A web based blood glucose management program that meets the objectives as specified above
e)	Continued support and training for the program

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance of work will be based upon the review of the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  All deliverables and reports shall be inspected and approved by the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  Project completion will culminate upon receipt and approval of all deliverables and the project briefing to the Diabetes Branch Chief, David M. Harlan, M.D., Captain, U.S. Public Health Service, Building 10, CRC Room 5-5940, Bethesda, MD  20892.

Period and Place of Performance

The work for this project will be performed both onsite at NIDDK and offsite at the contractor?s office.  The period of performance will be Base Year plus Four (4) Option Years.  The first year is the base contract which will include the product development/testing and production/maintenance periods.

The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product suppobasic elements of the proposed cost or price.  These elements will include labor/personnel costs and items of other direct costs (e.g. materials, subcontracts, travel, etc.).

4.	Provide a breakdown of labor hours, rates, and other direct cost by appropriate category.  Key personnel will be identified.  Give the basis for the estimates for each category.

5.	Vendors must submit one original and three (3) copies of their respective Quotations.

6.	The vendor may submit comparable information on all subcontractors that are proposed to perform a subcontract under this RFQ.

7.	The vendor may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts/awards and corrective actions taken by the vendor.

8.	Any quotation which fails to address all technical portions of the solicitation will be deemed non-responsive.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product support.
7.	Contractor must be knowledgeable about current health care policies regarding privacy. 

Project Deliverables
a)	Plan of Action
b)	Key processes flowchart
c)	Training resources for the staff
d)	A web based blood glucose management program that meets the objectives as specified above
e)	Continued support and training for the program

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR HOTEL AND CONFERENCE FACILITIES FOR SPACE FLIGHT AWARENESS EVENTS. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued.  The purpose of this amendment is to (1) extend the response due date and (2) address the Answers in response to Questions from prospective offerors regarding this Combined Synopsis:  The due date for receipt of offers is extended to January 29, 2008 @ 3:00 PM CST.  Responses to Space Flight Awareness (SFA) Questions: Question 1:  Has the SFA NASA procurement been awarded?  Have had a few hoteliers contact me to question if the procurement has been awarded to a third party?  We are all a little confused, as a few third parties have contacted us informing us that they are representing this program. Answer 1:  Solicitation NNJ08231499Q has not been awarded, and will not be awarded until after the bid deadline in the text of the Solicitation.  While third parties are welcome to submit an offer in response to this Solicitation, we have not awarded the contract to a third party nor are any third parties representing NASA in relation to this solicitation.
