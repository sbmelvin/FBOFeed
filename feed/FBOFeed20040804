<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number 08-3k47-04, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  USDA, ARS, BARC has an requirement for an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer for use in the analysis of solid and liquid manure, soils, plants, and their liquid extracts by Energy Dispersive X-ray  fluorescence (ED-XRF). ED-XRF must allow for the macro analysis of multiple elements while leaving the sample intact for further chemical and microanalysis. The NAICS Code is 334516 with a small business standard of 500 employees. The Government intends to award on a sole source basis to Spectro Analytical Instruments, Inc. pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.3.   Inside delivery is required to FOB destination to the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, Maryland, 20705-2350, within 180 days of award. Inspection and Acceptance will be performed at Building 306 BARC-East Beltsville, Maryland. The analyzer must meet the following minimum criteria:

 Line item 01  Limits of detection: P: 20 ppm or lower, Al, Fe, K: 30 ppm or lower, Ca: 15 ppm or lower,  Mg:  50 ppm or lower, Na: 100 ppm or lower and limits of detection less than one (1)  ppm   for  trace elements of atomic number higher than above elements in soil, plant, and manure samples with minimal preparation. Critical user-specific analyses must include phosphorus, magnesium, aluminum, iron, and calcium in liquid and/or solid manure, soils, and plants, and their liquid extracts. The accuracy of the analytical results are of critical 
importance in the environmental phosphorus fate research in the Animal Manure and By-Products Laboratory.

 Line item 02 Instrument Specifications: The analyzer must have automated multi-sample analysis capabilities, sample size (sample cell) of 10 square mm or greater for larger sample analysis and a sample chamber operable under conditions to improve low energy fluorescent X-ray performance i.e. Vacuum or inert gas purging. The analyzer must have an excitation X-ray source of 400 watts or greater and fluorescent X-ray detection optimized for measurements at the specifications above, with a low thermal 
loading of liquid and solid samples.

Line item 03 The analyzer must have automated individual sample matrix correction and background noise minimization to compensate for irregularities found in manure suspensions, manure solids, soil and plant samples for enhanced analytical sensitivity.
 Control software must be able to operate under Windows TM 2000 or XP and produce user-accessible files of spectral data in text file format.

Line item 04 The analyzer must be supplied with a one-year or 
longer warranty on parts and labor and must also include installation, on-site start-up assistance, and training supplied by factory-trained personnel.

Line item 05 Because screening analysis of manure and soils are to be performed, all the matrix effects must be taken into account.  The method utilized must be the polarized X-ray radiation for exciting the elements in the sample in addition to the fundamental parameters method.  Due to the strength of the polarization automatic matrix correction based on Compton backscattering using a molybdenum (Mo) secondary target is necessary.  Because heterogeneity of manure suspensions is a common occurrence in research samples, automatic individualized matrix correction and background noise minimization are critically necessary to compensate for matrix irregularities inherent to liquid manure suspensions, manure solids, and ground soil amended with manures to provide enhanced analytical sensitivity. The following FAR clauses and provisions apply:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items.Award to a technically acceptable offeror, at a fair and reasonable price; The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in order of importance: 1. price  2. technical capability of the item and  3. past performance .

       (b) All disputes arising under or relating to this contract shall be resolved under this clause.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.  The submission may be converted to a claim by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as a liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
       (d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.  A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
     (ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
     (iii) The certification shall state as follows: “I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor”.
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
       (e) For the Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request.  For contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
       (f) The Contracting Officer’s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals to the Chief, Procurement Branch, UNICOR, Federal Prison Industries within 90 days of the date of the Contractor’s receipt of the adverse decision.  The decision of the Chief, Procurement Branch on a Contractor’s appeal will be final.
       (g) Within 10 days of the Contractor’s receipt of an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision on a claim, the Contractor may request, and Federal Prison Industries will participate in, non-binding alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by means mutually acceptable to the parties.  Any ADR shall be completed within 60 days of the Contractor’s request, unless the parties agree to a longer period.  A Contractor’s request for, and participation in, ADR will not toll the 90 day time limit within which to appeal an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision to the Chief, Procurement Branch.  
       (h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having a defective certification, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim.

<DESC>The U.S. Marine Corps has a requirement for an AH-1W Linkless Feed Program, which calls for replacing the current A/A49E-7 (V4) 20MM Turett System Linked Feed Assembly with one that utilizes the Linkless bulk 20MM ammunition that is common to other Department of Navy (DON) 20MM systems (F/A-18, CIWS).  The 20MM Linkless Feed modification will be installed in 181 aircraft and two trainers.  At a minimum, the new system should include replacement of the ammunition can, feed chutes, and replacement or  modification to the current feeder mechanism for the AH-1W A/A49E-7 (V4) 20MM Turret System.  Additionally, the modified/new system will stay within existing size, weight, and power restrictions without changes to the existing airframe.  Ammunition loading in austere locations/environments including Forward Arming and Refueling Point (FARP) and shipboard environments are required.  This change will be incorporated into and reused when the AH-1W is remanufactured into the AH-1Z.  Expected release of the Request For Proposal (RFP) will be in early September.  Once the RFP is issued, all responsible sources may submit a proposal. Once released in early September, the RFP can be located at:http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.   In addition, the Government will allow those offerors interested in a Pre-Proposal Conference meeting to visit the Government’s facility at Patuxent River, MD to discuss the RFP after it has been released.  The time and date must be agreed upon by the Government and potential offeror and must be scheduled before the proposal due date to be established in the solicitation.   For those potential offerors interested in viewing the AH-1W aircraft, please contact the Contract Specialist to establish a time and date for the site visit.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Science and Technology Partnerships
(OSTP), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure services on a sole source basis of a Yeast Two-Hybrid Screening Service (Construction of bait, constructs, prey libraries, and delivery of resulting binding interaction data) with Myriad Genetics, 320 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.   The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking a commercial partner to complete yeast two-hybrid searches for Institute investigators. The NCI has requested the complete analysis of more than 35 proteins over the course of the next year.  The NCI requires access to an efficient and reliable yeast two-hybrid assay technology that maximizes the chances of detecting physiologically relevant binding interactions while minimizing false-positive data.  Dr. Paul Bartel came to Myriad from the laboratory of Dr. Stanley Fields, inventor of the yeast two-hybrid.  Since being at Myriad, Dr. Bartel has developed a highly automated and robust high-throughput yeast two-hybrid platform called ProNet.  Using ProNet, each protein of interest is analyzed as a series of several overlapping fragments or "baits".   A typical protein is parsed into 10 baits.  ProNet uses a highly efficient mating strategy whereby a single bait fragment is tested against several million unique prey fragments.  A double genetic selection serves to isolate only those few pairs of protein fragments that can interact.  DNA sequencing, performed at Myriad's core DNA sequencing facility, confirms the identity of the original bait protein and its interacting partner.  The capacity and throughput of the ProNet process enables Myriad to pursue this unique screening strategy.   Myriad Genetics is the only source known to the NCI that offers a unique combination of experience, technology, bio-informatics, activation domain libraries and industrial-scale throughput to enable and complete a custom yeast two-hybrid program. Myriad's resources and experimental approaches ensure the highest quality of results in the shortest time frame. No other technology is capable of completing so many high quality, exhaustive, yeast two-hybrid searches for a single protein in 4 to 6 months.  Investigators from other institutes at NIH including NIEHS have has a very successful and productive contractual history with Myriad Genetics.  Utilization of ProNet by NCI investigators will save the Institute scientists' time and financial resources. Investigators will be able to concentrate fully on other more highly specialized and expert scientific challenges.  Access to Myriad's proprietary web-based interface (customized for each project), is initiated at the outset so that the collaborator may follow the progress of the project and view interaction data curated from the literature. Myriad's curated database of publicly reported protein-protein interactions includes more than 4000 references describing over 10,000 interactions; it is the only known database of its kind available. By coupling the database with several proprietary informatics tools, Myriad enables ProNet clients to more fully query, manipulate and utilize the results of their ProNet searches.   This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EST on August 13, 2004.   If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Solicitation number NCI-40124-NG must be stated on all correspondence.

<SUBJECT>A -- Cardiothoracic Surgery and Acute Care Research Protocols

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to complete the process of reestablishing its capacity for research in cardiothoracic surgery (CTS) and to integrate this program with ongoing acute care research on patients who present in the early hours of heart attack and stroke.  The Institute plans to link with Suburban Hospital’s clinicians and acute care patient base as part of the research conducted by its Clinical Research Program (CRP), Division of Intramural Research.  NHLBI’s cardiothoracic surgery capabilities within the Institute were phased out over 10 years ago for a variety of reasons.  During that time surgeries were performed under contract on an as needed basis only for patients enrolled in CRP protocols.  Those protocols were not for research on CTS itself.  Changes in CTS in recent years require evaluation and further development of innovative surgical techniques.  Also, changes in policies, regulations, and treatment combine with the changes in CTS to highlight the positive benefits that interaction between basic science and clinical investigations have created .  Ongoing and frequent interaction between clinicians and patients at Suburban Hospital, and basic scientists at NHLBI, will bring the changes in CTS and acute cardiac care into clinical practice more quickly through an integrated research approach.

The goal of the CTS Branch in the NHLBI is to conduct innovative clinical research that will advance the field and to train cardiothoracic surgeons in research methodologies and techniques.  The NHLBI plans an approach that will build on the established clinical excellence, and will pursue mutually beneficial research collaborations both with Suburban and with other NIH Institutes and Centers.  NIH offers links between basic science and clinical investigations, relative swiftness in translating basic science to clinical usage, access to state-of-the-art animal facilities, presence of multidisciplinary research teams, capability to focus on selected science and health problems, support of a centralized coordinating facility, organization of a center of excellence in clinical research, and ability to provide integrated service delivery.   


NHLBI needs access to an acute care patient base so that the clinical research, applied and basic research, and training and education components it envisions can be integrated with its ongoing program of acute care research to carry out its cardiothoracic surgery research protocols.  Cardiothoracic surgical facilities must be available on a 24 x 7 basis (24 hours per day, 7 days per week) as some of the patients will be admitted on an emergency basis.  Cardiothoracic surgeon(s) and interventional cardiologists will conduct research at the NIH campus and at Suburban Hospital, and will perform cardiothoracic surgery and procedures at Suburban Hospital.  NHLBI also will extend its core role in facilitating and fostering communication and cooperation among clinical and laboratory researchers by establishing locally a CTS fellowship program that then could be extended nationally as slots are available.  Staff and fellows will need to move quickly between the research environment at NIH and the cardiothoracic surgical facility at Suburban.  Therefore, close proximity between the acute care site and the NIH campus (5 minutes driving time or 10 minutes by foot) is required to permit NHLBI clinical and technical staff the ability to respond to acute patient issues in a timely fashion from the NIH campus, and is critical to the success of this project.  

Development of this research infrastructure centered around multidisciplinary core programs and specific research projects will enable the NHLBI to continue to attract the leaders and mentors needed to do the innovative research and help train the next generation of cardiothoracic surgeons.  The research infrastructure will provide the ongoing, day-to-day approach that will facilitate moving results from research into practice.

The NHLBI intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Suburban Hospital for a seven year contract program to provide the acute care component of CTS, if Suburban Hospital receives a Certificate of Need to perform cardiac surgery from the Maryland Health Care Commission.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a Request for Proposals.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the University of Wisconsin Madison under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), for support in reviewing the license application to be submitted by the Atomic Energy Canada Limited (AECL) Technologies for the “Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR-700)”.  Specifically, the proposed work involves assessment of the molten fuel moderator interaction (MFMI) experimental data, fuel-coolant interaction calculations for ACR-700, and analysis of other ACR-700 severe accident issues, which will require modification and assessment of the FCI code TEXAS.  The University of Wisconsin at Madison is the developer of the FCI code TEXAS.  By virtue of this, it is the only organization to have complete knowledge of all the models in the code and the associated assessment data base.  As such, the code developer is uniquely qualified to determine which code models require modifications and which new models require development for ACR-700 FCI Analysis.  The TEXAS code has been extensively used by the developer in the past to provide technical support to the NRC staff in reviewing other reactor license applications.  The proposed contract will be cost-reimbursement type contract.  The period of performance is 45 months from date of contract award.   This notice of intent is neither a request for quotes or a solicitation of offers.    Interested firms must submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform the required services to the above address not later than 45 calendar days from the date this announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities.  Capability statements that do not fully demonstrate the respondent’s ability to satisfy the requirements above will not be considered.

The contractor is General Dynamics Government Systems Corporation, located in Needham VA.  The contract was competitively awarded on 6 July 2001 with a base period through 30 June 2002 and four one-year option periods.  It provides management, maintenance and repair and logistics support of the existing highly sophisticated and critical communications system and subsystems used in support of NORAD/NORTHCOM, including system improvements, upgrades and modifications which require engineering knowledge and experience.

These requirements consist of replacement of the Radio Interface Concentration (RIC) equipment, replacement of existing Telex DVC 5000 telephone switches, voice recorders, battery backup power and recitifiers, public address system, tactical secure voice alignment, repair and return support for additional infrastructure/hardware, interior radar sites, support for ground to air radio sites and satellite antennas and modems.  As a result of the continued support, the contract not-to-exceed funding ceiling will be increased from $73,350,000 to $98,064,000, an increase of $24,714,000.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  This notice of intent is not a request for proposal.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences’ (DCCPS), Office of Cancer Survivorship (OCS), plans to procure on a sole source basis services for the second CancerCare Cancer Survivorship Teleconference series from Cancer Care, Inc., 275 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001.  As we race into the new millennium, cancer for increasing numbers has become a curable illness and for most, a controllable disease.  However, it is becoming rapidly apparent that few of our modern therapies are benign.  The chronic and late effects of cancer and its treatment can range from mild and transient problems, to serious and at times fatal conditions, and affect all aspects of function: physical, functional, emotional, social and economic.  Over the past decade, CancerCare, Inc. has pioneered educational teleconferences as a means of extending the capacity or ‘reach’ of efforts to communicate important health information.  CancerCare’s Telephone Education Workshops have become a highly effective method through which to disseminate information about cancer to as broad an audience as possible – immediately overcoming barriers created by distance, physical disability and geographic isolation.  CancerCare’s educational teleconferences currently serve over 35,000 individuals in the US and abroad.  Participants engage in educational discussions in which scientific and clinical experts summarize current knowledge about and  techniques to address all aspects of the cancer experience.  The CancerCare organization offers approximately 70 to 75 cancer-related educational teleconference programs each year. The three topics for the third teleconference Cancer Survivorship Series  will be chosen based on feedback derived from Cancer Care’s formal evaluation process with prior year participants.  Currently, CancerCare is the exclusive coordinator of the CancerCare: Cancer survivorship teleconference series.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 18, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 541990, Size Standard 6M.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with Dr. Mark Thoman of Iowa, for continuation of existing services previously provided under another contract mechanism of providing 250 medical monitoring records and updating the Medical Surveillance (MEDS) field of the Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) with state of the art data.  The period of performance is one (1) year with two (2) successive one-year option periods.
 

The Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) is maintained by NLM’s Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS).  This factual data bank includes data on chemical substance identification, chemical & physical properties, safety & handling, toxicology, pharmacology and environmental fate and chemical detection methods for over 4600 chemical substances.  Critical chemical-related information of medical surveillance data on individuals who are exposed to chemical substances is entered into the MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE (MEDS) field of HSDB.  The purpose of this procurement is to update the MEDS field with 250 medical monitoring records and to examine the contents of this field for the purpose of identifying outdated information and unsubstantiated methods.  

Dr. Thoman is uniquely qualified to provide these services.  Dr. Thoman has worked directly with SIS in the planning and selection of medical surveillance data for the HSDB file.  He has produced 262 MEDS protocols for chemicals covered in the Ryan RP, Toxicology Desk Reference and the Agency for Toxic Substance’s Disease Registry (ATSDR) for HSDB.  He has demonstrated high quality of work.  The HSDB’s Scientific Review Panel (SRP) has reviewed the data and found it to be of scientific excellence and utility.  He has over thirty years experience in developing medical surveillance protocols for the Federal Aviation Commission, the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.  He is a founding member of the Society of Clinical Toxicology and has served on numerous advisory panels at the local, state and federal level.  Dr. Thoman will continue to develop these MEDS protocols using the ATSDR, National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety, and the Occupational Safety & Health Administration’s federally mandated Medical Records/Monitoring rulings.  Dr. Thoman has extensive literature resources and has assisted in improving the quality of HSDB MEDS data.  

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) ability to write MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE records which are chemical specific based on experience with accidental or occupational exposure to chemical substances; 2) prior experience in the creation for MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE records that are accepted by NLM’s Scientific Review Panel (SRP) for scientific accuracy or prior experience in interacting with a scientific advisory board which examines records/documents for scientific accuracy; 3) prior experience in regulatory issues of MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE at the federal level, such as OSHA’s medical requirements for individuals who are exposed to chemicals in the work place along with other agencies who provide detailed information on monitoring of exposed individuals to chemical substances; and 4) credentials that indicate a medical background with extensive experience in the subject area of clinical toxicology. 

Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-192/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Neha Dhir on 301-496-6546.

<DESC>The Department of Labor, International Child Labor Program, is seeking services from qualified professionals under Request for Proposals number DOL049RP10014, which was previously announced on July 27, 2004.  This modification is provided to answer questions and to extend the proposal due date to August 18, 2004, 5 p.m.  Proposal submission shall be by e-mail using MS Word, Adobe Acrobat or MS Excel attachments to provide the technical and pricing proposals.  The solicitation document and statement of work was was previously released on July 27 under this announcement number.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses under NAICS 541720, size standard of $6 million.  The following questions and answers are provided:
1) Question:  Can we submit a proposal for this effort even if we have submitted a grant for support of a specific country in the Middle East under the announcement published in the Federal Register?  Answer:  Yes.  This requirement is for program support.  It is very broad and not geared to any specific country.  Experience in dealing with international programs of this type, such as that solicited under the grants program, will be helpful experience but this is a completely separate requirement from the grant application process.  Respondees to this announcement would not be disqualified from submitting grants under the separate Federal Register announcement.  2) Question:  Would this award be for 5 years, a base year and option years?  Answer:  Yes and the years are not tied to Government fiscal years.  The first base period will be from date of award to a one year period, and there will be four more option years to follow.  3)  Question:  Are preliminary budget figures for the base year only?  Answer:  Yes.  4) Question:  Is this an IDIQ contract where the contractor would respond to specific task proposals for the four types of tasks listed?  The offeror needs to provide labor categories, labor hour rates, their previous experience, and resumes, for Government evaluation.  Answer:  A preliminary spend plan would be helpful, but a specific task level of effort will be negotiated once rates are known and it is seen what can be obtained.  5) Question:  Are there amendments to this RFP?  We would like more time to submit a proposal because of staff being on vacation.  Answer:  Yes, this is it, and we have extended the proposal due date to August 18.  6)  Question:  I have experience in programs with one particular Caribbean nation.  Can I submit a proposal for this requirement?  Answer:  Yes.  The DOL is looking for broad experience in dealing with the program of child labor.  Experience in a Caribbean nation would be helpful, but the emphasis of this requirement is not experience with a specific nation but in program experience as a whole.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide answers to the following questions we have received:  Question 1:  Can you elaborate on "Issue Management Functionality" & "Document Functionality"?  These terms mean different things to different people.  I want to make sure we understand what specific functionality DOE needs.  Answer 1:  Issue Management Functionality - the COTS product should have the capability to track & categorize project issues and resolutions.  It should also allow you to prioritize the issues for the project.  Document Management Functionality - the product should be able to act as a repository for documents listed under separate folders (by project) using the web interface.  Version control of documents should be easy to track.  Question 2:  Capture - Can ED provide more detail to the requirement for document checkin? For example, is there any existing legacy data planned for checkin (e.g. hardcopy paper, non MS office "e" files) and/or is the checkin particularly focused on new MS Office/Project data types. Corresponding with the capture requirement, can ED provide a rough estimate of the data volume anticipated across the 150 end-user licenses planned for deployment.  Answer 2:  There is no need to do any document capturing.  All documents are in electronic format as stated in the solicitation.  We do not anticipate more than approximately 500 documents.  Question 3:  Has there been any preliminary analysis work performed by the ED regarding the index fields necessary to support control of the data planned for storage in the project archive?  Answer 3:  Yes, all documents should be stored by project name.  Question 4:  Is the ED anticipating the vendor would bid the implementation services surrounding the capture requirement into its bid?  Answer 4:  We are not sure how to anwer this question.  Can you clarify further what you are asking?  Question 5:  Security - Does the ED anticipate that any advanced security features will be provided with the system?  Answer 5:  No, ID and password protection.  Question 6:  Are they any particular security or sensitive data requirements the ED would expect the system to include for the project archive?  For example: Is it necessary to virtually separate the project archive data into their respective project categories and limit access to those personnel assigned or authorized to access the project data or will all 150 end users have access to the same data.  Answer 6:  Users should only have  access(authorization) to the documents within the project they are working on.  Question 7:  Are there any specific data types or sets of information (e.g. cost) which may have unique security profiles.  Answer 7:  No.  Question 8:  If the former approach is selected, has the ED already identified the primary project areas it would like to secure separate from other project areas.  Answer 8:  No.  Question 9:  Collaboration - Are there processing requirements associated with the collaboration component of the  solicitation?  For example, when a project is changed for some reason (schedule change, resource availability modifications, etc.) is there an approval process prior to incorporating this change?  Answer 9:  No.  Question 10:  If there is an associated review process associated with related project documents used (visio, MS office and Adobe are mentioned in the Solicitation), are these documents redlined, commented, etc. during the process?  Answer 10:  Yes.  Question 11:  How is change communicated within the project workspace? Is there a formal change request process? Answer 11:  No.  Question 12:  Access - Is tracking of access to the files and actions resulting from access (e.g., read, edit, delete) required? Answer 12:  No.
Question 13:  Will a firewall separate the users from the hosted system?  Answer 13:  No.  Question 14:  If so, what are the security requirements for the firewall? Answer 14:  N/A.
Question 15:  What exactly do you mean by "cross project management functionality"  Answer 15:  The ability to manage more than one project simultaneously, and the ability to exchange files or information between two or more projects.  For example, Project A might be underway, but then a relationship with Project E might be discovered: information exchanges or joint scheduling between A and E might be added to both projects in flight.
Question 16:  Can you explain the scope of the file compatibility.  Answer 16:  The ability to open and read files from other cited applications.  The ability to create new content and export it directly to other applications in a file format readable by that other application.

FAR 13.5 Test
Basis for Award
August 2003

This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing simplified procedures authorized by FAR 13.5, "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items."  For quotations determined technically acceptable, a best value selection based on price and past performance will be made.

An offeror will be determined technically acceptable if no exception is taken to the specifications and requirements of the RFQ.  Award will be based on both price and past performance.  Each offeror's quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.  Price will always be an important factor; therefore, offerors should make diligent efforts to control costs and submit fairly priced quotes.  Past performance will be evaluated based on relevancy (size/scope/complexity), quality of product/service, timeliness of delivery/performance and business relations (customer service).  To be considered for award an offeror must have a satisfactory or better past performance record based upon information available to the contracting officer [normally the Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR)] and offer a reasonable price.  The offeror may be asked to submit references that can provide relevant past performance information if the contracting officer cannot locate CPAR information.  Award may be made to other than the low offeror when, after evaluating past performance, the contracting officer determines it to be in the government's best interest.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Human & Robotic Technology TB-04-02 which was posted on Jun 29, 2004. You are notified that the following changes are made.  Posting of Questions and Answers (See below) from the pre-proposal conference held on Jul 29, 2004.  Additional information for Technology Database System BAA Supporting Information is available at the website referenced for the BAA below. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=04  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A link to briefing charts and further details on current acquisition activities includiing the Broad Agency Announcement is available at the website identified below: https://naccsli1.msfc.nasa.gov/ExplorationPortal H&RT Pre-Proposal Conference, Q&As Q1.	Is cryogenic propellant the main in-space engine and is it necessary that it be cryogenic, if a non-cryogenic propulsion system can meet the requirements in a practical and affordable way?   In regards to high-energy space systems, if a proposer has a system that is not high energy and it meets the requirements.	 Is the high energy the important part, the cryogenic or is it the work that is produced? A1.	If a system can meet the requirements it may be proposed. The technology themes mentioned in the High Energy Space Systems (HESS) Element Program are the areas that we feel have the most potential for H &RT.  Q2.	Page 43 of the view graphs, under “Relevance to NASA objectives” it states “objectives to including applicability to a sole primary and sole secondary program element”, please explain A2.	By requiring the offerors to identify a primary and secondary element program of technology development, this will require the offerors to explain to NASA how relevant their projects are to H&RT goals and objectives. Q3.	What is the total BAA budget? A3.	There is no fixed dollar amount for a specific BAA. Q4.	Is the intention to fund 1 to 2 projects within each 2nd level element or could it be that 5 or 6 projects are funded in one 2nd level element and none are funded in another? A4.	H&RT will integrate a comprehensive investment portfolio based on the selected proposals. Q5.	For NASA Co-Investigators, what is the allowable allocation of funds between industry-government?   A5.	There is no set quota.	It is up to the offeror to determine how the funds will be distributed based on the makeup of his management and technical teams.  Q6.	Is there a vision on what submission teams should look like?  Is University  	     involvement a plus?  What kind of lead institution is NASA looking for and does  	     that vary from project to project? A6.	It is up to the offeror to determine the best makeup of his team that will provide the best quality research towards H&RT goals and objectives.  NASA will not make any specific teaming suggestions other than to choose those partners that you feel will make a significant contribution to your project. Q7.	Is fuel cell technology within advanced space technology? A7.	YES Q8.	If a NASA center teams with a successful proposer, can that same center manage the project? A8	The teaming arrangement will be identified by the NOIs, which will describe the relationship with any NASA Center.  In no situation will a co-investigator, or the organization that has a fiduciary interest in the project be the contracting officer technical representative (COTR), or the host of the COTR. Q9.	Is there going to be a second round of intramural requests? A9.	Our goal is to make it through the first three stages in our portfolio development.  We have just completed our ICP and are starting with this BAA.  The third stage will involve the issuance of a gap H&RT BAA to fill in the research activities that were missed with the first two.  Q10.	For the ICP, there was a down select from 1,300 NOIs to 135 proposals submitted.  How many proposals do you anticipate requesting for the H&RT BAA? A10.	It really depends on the quality of the NOIs and the available budget for structuring a comprehensive H&RT portfolio.  Q11.	Will the winning/losing intramural proposals be released to the public in sufficient detail so proposers to the extramural can avoid duplication? A11.	We have decided that it is appropriate for individual NASA ICP project proposal authors to share their individual proposals with potential extramural partners at their discretion so long as no proprietary information is released inappropriately.  We don't want to disrupt the development of individual proprietary negotiations between NASA co-PIs and external offerors.  However, because of the proprietary nature of most of the ICP proposals, a general release of the ICP proposals would be inappropriate. We leave it up to the individual Centers to decide how they want to handle the development of external partnerships. Previous discussion about development of summary descriptions of the ICP proposals is up to the discretion of the Centers. Q12.	What are the mission power requirements anticipated for mars and lunar missions?  What is the Mass anticipated for lunar missions? A12.	 No baseline mission architecture for H&RT has been established.  Any future BAA information on mission architecture baselines will be determined by the combined efforts of the Requirements, H&RT, and Project Constellation activities. Q13.	Who will take the lead for defining the mission architecture?  Is NASA looking for industry to come up with the concepts or will there be guidance from NASA as proposals continue to come in? A13.	No baseline mission architecture for H&RT has been established.  Any future BAA information on mission architecture baselines will be determined by the combined efforts of the Requirements, H&RT, and Project Constellation activities. Q14.	Explain the down select process among the different proposals from the first year to the second and how NASA plans to: time the process so that it ensures continuity in the programs that are progressing forward and also gives people time to redeploy people in the programs that will not continue A14.	H&RT will oversee the progress of the projects based on the various status reports, earned value reports, project review, etc.  These activities will allow NASA to identify early enough which projects have the best chance of proceeding to a Phase II. Q15.	Can sounding rocket flight experiments be conducted under TM topics (not InSTEP)? A15.	As with any other launch carrier, H&RT will use sounding rockets for its  	    technology flight experiments (TFEs) only if its economical and it maximizes the  	    achievement of the science & engineering objectives.  Q16.	A project with significant university and industry participation, is it better to have the industry or the university as the lead?  A16.	There is no quota or preference and it could go either way.  It is imperative to look for technical leadership that makes the most sense from the project management and product delivery point of view.  Q17.	Will comments be sent back to the proposer for the white papers? A17.	We are attempting to implement a process that would provide a high level of input back to the offerors. Q18.	How does NASA expect H&RT programs to interact with Technology Development programs in other NASA directorates (e.g., ISP in science directorate or NMPL in science directorate)? A18.	A coordination staff was created at NASA HQ that plans and discusses our mutual investments and continues to be worked internally. This will be an ongoing effort in order for NASA to maximize its return on investment of research dollars. Q19.	Will proposals by consortiums of applicants including universities be accepted? A19.	Yes, they will be accepted. Q20.	Can primary and secondary elements in NOI (see page 40 of briefing) be from different cost “buckets.”  If yes, how will you judge from a cost perspective? A20.	Each offeror is required to identify the type of project (I-VI) that he/she will propose.  Within this type project, the offeror is required to identify the primary and secondary element H&RT programs that will be impacted.	The primary and secondary define the cost buckets within the type of project proposed.  Q21.	Can national labs be the lead, such as Sandia National Lab? A21.	Yes, any national laboratory and research institution can be a lead for proposed   project. Q22.	If you are not selected for this go around will the proposal be kept and be considered for future announcements. A22.	There will probably be a pool of projects that we would recommend if additional funding would arise.  However, recognize that as we move forward our needs will become clearer so the shelf life would be relatively finite of these proposals.  Q23.	In November of 2004 there is an expectation to have an international participation conference and its location of that conference defined yet and what are the expected outcomes of such a conference. A23.	Expectation is to build an interest, stimulate partnerships within the international community and convey the new policies that NASA is trying to achieve.  Explorations Systems Mission Directorate will work closely with NASA External Affairs regarding any future partnerships on space exploration. Information regarding any meetings with any International Partners will be posted on the Exploration website.  Q24.	What is the current $/kg goals for launch and deep space transport?  Are space system assembly operations to be robotic?   A24.	NASA has no set $/kg goals for launch and deep space transport.  NASA looks forward to the various proposals to help determine an affordable range of $/kg goals.   Space system assembly operations will be either robotic or a combination of both human and robotic.  The type of mission to be carried out will determine the proper mix of human and robotic resources to use. Q25.	Is significant participation by NASA centers encouraged, and what percentage of the effort should be by the contractor? A25.	As a minimum, a NASA Center will participate as part of its subject-matter area oversight responsibility.  Any further involvement by a NASA Center will depend on the technical and management approaches of the proposal.   Q26.	Do the technology theme elements have sub element themes and if so, where can we access the sub element themes? A26.	The sub-element themes are referred to in the H&RT Formulation Plan definition of the element technology themes beginning on page-35. For example, “Advanced Studies, Concepts And Tools Program” has a technology theme entitled “Advanced Concepts”.  The “Advanced Concepts” definition (page-36) describes the sub-element themes. Q27.	We have system-level studies we wish to propose that result in recommendations.  We also have component technologies to develop to support that system.	Can NASA provide any general guidance? A27.	Reference the definition of Technology Readiness Level (TRL).  Low TRL (2-5) generally corresponds to component research, and system level research corresponds to technologies having TRL &gt; 5.  Low TRL research usually belongs in ASTP and system level research belongs in TMP. In H&RT, TMP supports technology maturation from (4-6) and ASTP supports research from (2-5).  The reason for the overlap is so that nothing will be missed. Refer to page 2 of the BAA for the definition of ASTP and TMP. Q28.	Is a NASA center partnership letter of intent required for the NOI submittal? A28.	No.  The NASA center partnership letter of intent is not required for the NOI submittal but will be required for the submittal of the full proposals.

1.0  Background

The Department of Defense (DoD) is has begun an enterprise-wide transformation to improve its business and financial management operations.  Goals of this transformation include:  (1) sufficient visibility over information concerning resources to achieve an Unqualified Audit Opinion on the 2007 consolidated financial statement; (2) sufficient visibility and understanding of functions needed for improved business operations to rationalize and optimize investments in systems and Programs; and  (3) sufficient visibility and understanding of the end-to-end processes needed for improved business operations to identify business process re-engineering initiatives that will ensure optimum business processes across the Department.  By achieving these goals, DoD will leverage resources applied to business operations and increase resources available to support the war fighter and intelligence communities.   To assist the Department in achieving this goal, the Secretary of Defense established the Business Management Modernization Program (BMMP), which is leading the transformation.  The BMMP is co-chaired by the Department’s Under Secretary, Comptroller (OUSD (C)) and Assistant Secretary for Networks Information Integration (NII)/Chief Information Officer (CIO).   

2.0 Objectives

The overall objective is to assist the Director, Business Modernization Systems Integration (BMSI), in creation of, and monitoring execution of, an integrated business transformation plan for DoD, focused on those functional priorities represented in the BMMP Increments.  This overall business transformation plan will be focused on capabilities required by the Department, and the associated policies, procedures, processes, and information technology (IT) systems and interfaces.

The requirements and objectives of this statement of work (SOW) are to provide critically needed senior executive advice, counsel, and recommendations to formulate, monitor, assess, evolve and adjust the overall Department’s Business Transformation Strategy, the strategy planning framework and the corresponding implementation approach.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS.  This is a request for information only.  This is not a notice of RFP or RFQ issuance.

The objective of this Request for Information is to gather information from commercial enterprises which currently provide IEEE 802.11 series wireless LAN hardware and software systems.  This information will be used by the House to deepen its knowledge of commercially available technologies and to assist in the development of requirements and terms of any subsequent, competitive solicitation.  Respondents of interest to the House may be invited to demonstrate their systems.

The House Mobile Computing Program (HMCP) was created to develop wireless LAN network services to support the U.S. House of Representatives. While the HMCP effort is not intended to provide ubiquitous wireless LAN access, it will greatly improve the access to information in a variety of important locations.  It is currently envisioned that candidate areas for wireless coverage include the following:
•	Committee hearing rooms and ante rooms
•	Conference rooms
•	Self-scheduled meeting rooms
•	Banquet rooms
•	Cafeteria areas

This notice is initiated to compile a list of companies that can provide assistance to House Information Resources (HIR) in the development of a secure, reliable, manageable, and scalable wireless LAN network.

Program Goals

The House desires a technology solution that meets the goals listed below:  

A. Data Transport Goals

1.	Provide data transport between wireless client devices and the wired campus LAN network for services such as access to Internet, intranet, e-mail, file and print services, and other network applications in such a way that it is transparent to these services and does not affect them in any way.
2.	Provide the necessary mechanisms to support user mobility (allowing users to access the wireless network at any House location with wireless coverage).
3.	Provide mechanisms for efficient use of the wireless medium such as adjustable transmit power, ability to use external antennas, automatic radio frequency (RF) channel selection, load balancing between multiple access points (APs), and adjustments to the 802.11 Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol and Physical (PHY) layer parameters.
4.	Interoperate seamlessly with the wired campus LAN infrastructure interfaces, services, and protocols such as 10/100 and Gigabit Ethernet, 802.1Q VLANs, DHCP, Spanning Tree Protocol, and Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol.
5.	Provide device compatibility by using components that are WiFi CERTIFIED for IEEE Std 802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g.
6.	Provide mechanisms supporting reliability such as the ability to operate in a hot-standby mode.
7.	Provide flexibility of device placement by using APs that may be located in areas such as above drop-ceilings and in plenum areas, and by using APs that may be powered via IEEE Std 802.3af Power-over-Ethernet (POE).
8.	Provide system flexibility by supporting upgrades to provide features defined in forthcoming IEEE standards such as 802.11e, 802.11i, 802.11k, and 802.11n once they are published.


B. Security Goals

1.	Provide appropriate user authentication such as Extensible Authentication Protocol - Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS), EAP with tunneled TLS (EAP-TTLS), and Protected EAP (PEAP).
2.	Provide appropriate data confidentiality (privacy) such as that found in WiFi Protected Access (WPA) and WPA2 (IEEE Std 802.11i).
3.	Provide appropriate data integrity such as that found in WPA and WPA2 (IEEE Std 802.11i).
4.	Provide detection, reporting, and (if possible) the location of any unauthorized wireless infrastructure equipment, such as rogue APs.
5.	Provide detection and reporting of unauthorized activity on the wireless medium such as wireless peer-to-peer connectivity, denial of service, client hijacking, and spoofing.
6.	Provide the ability to protect sensitive information on an AP (e.g. access lists, passwords, and authentication lists) if it is physically removed or stolen.
7.	Provide mechanisms to implement or support security policies such as disabling SSID broadcast; data traffic filtering; differentiation of access and privileges by user group (guest, standard, admin); alerting, reporting, and logging; and authentication lockout after failed attempts.
8.	Provide transport of security services such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in such a way that it is transparent to these services and does not affect them in any way.
9.	Interoperate with a variety of other network security architecture components such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and authentication databases.
10.	Provide mechanisms to enable administrators to effectively monitor and respond to a variety of system security conditions.
11.	Provide flexibility of device placement by using security sensors that may be located in areas such as above drop-ceilings and in plenum areas, and by using security sensors that may be powered via IEEE Std 802.3af Power-over-Ethernet (POE).


C. Management and Support Goals

1.	Provide management of the wireless access infrastructure from a centralized system.
2.	Provide mechanisms such as system logging, syslog logging, SNMP traps, and diagnostic utilities to enable administrators to effectively monitor and respond to system fault conditions.
3.	Provide mechanisms to enable administrators to observe, modify, store, and restore system configuration state, and to allow such operations to be done on many devices in an efficient way. 
4.	Provide mechanisms to enable administrators to manage system resource accounting in areas such as administrator activities and physical assets.
5.	Provide mechanisms to enable administrators to monitor and adjust system performance conditions.
6.	Interoperate with a variety of network management platforms (e.g. HP OpenView) using SNMP v2 and public Management Information Bases (MIBs).
7.	Provide mechanisms to enable administrators to monitor, troubleshoot, and resolve any problems with end user operation.
8.	Support the development of a central repository of information on all authorized and active wireless users and devices.  Such a repository would include data such as user identification, end station IP and MAC addresses, associated AP, and other end station attributes.
9.	Provide a mechanism to support multiple classes of administrators with different privileges, and to enable administrator authentication, authorization, and accounting through the use of services such as Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS).

System Description

The House welcomes any information received from interested parties.  Specifically, please provide the information requested below.  

Part 1: A description of the system or reference architecture that is offered as a solution to meet the goals of the HMCP program.  The description should include:
•	The specific name and model number of each component

Pricing

Please provide a pricing estimate for a system that would provide wireless LAN service and meet the program goals above (or a clearly-defined subset of them) in the following scenario:
•	A total of twenty five (25) conference rooms in several buildings on campus.
•	Each room measures approximately 25 feet by 25 feet, and contains windows. 
•	Thirteen (13) of the rooms have drop-ceiling.  The other twelve (12) have dry wall ceilings.
•	Rooms are geographically dispersed, so RF coverage must be provided individually (not shared among rooms) and no rooms share a common wiring closet.
•	APs and security sensors should receive power via IEEE 802.3af Power-over-Ethernet.
•	Assume a maximum of 20 occupants in each room and no more than 15 of those would be actively using the wireless LAN at any moment (accessing the network services listed in the Program Goals above).
•	Wireless clients in each room will be assigned addressing via DHCP from a separate IP subnet per room.
•	Assume that wireless clients are procured through a different program.  Pricing on wireless client devices should not be included in the pricing estimate.

Price is intended for ROM budgetary purposes only and firm quotes are not required.

<SUBJECT>A -- RFI for Nationwide Sheep & Goat ID & Tracking System
<DESC>1. This is a special notice requesting information concerning the presence of resources/mature technologies with the potential to contribute to a performance based identification system for sheep and goats. This system will be used to identify sheep and goats in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) National Scrapie Eradication Program. The performance requirements for this system will be detailed in subsequent paragraphs. 

General 
The identification system must be usable in all or nearly all types of sheep and goats of all ages managed in diverse environments. The system must accommodate the present scrapie program identification device requirements. If printing is a component of the ID system, it shall meet the requirements for approved tags in 9 CFR be large enough to permit easy legibility at 3 ¨C 5 feet distance. The device should be adequate to accommodate a 9 character alphanumeric flock identification number and a consecutively numbered individual animal ID sequence, or a 12 character alphanumeric serial number. These are unique numbers and shall not be duplicated.  To enhance animal identification recording and animal movement tracking other ID technologies may be used beyond visual systems.


Performance Specifications for ID systems beyond Visual-only systems
The system should be functional in typical settings and field environments that would occur within the U.S.  ID devices used must have a high retention rate (preferably ¡Ü 1% per year loss) in various environments and must persist for at least 24 hours post mortem.
The device must be easily applied or installed on or within the animal with minimal risk to the animal.  During the reading process animal throughput of 1000 animals per hour should be feasible.  Read success through these high throughput settings should exceed 95%.   Read success must occur within chutes and alleyways used at points of animal concentration (such as, but not limited, to auction markets, loading facilities, on-farm working facilities, slaughterhouse entry chutes, and shows and fairs).  The devices should not contaminate or adulterate the carcass or offal and must either be removed during routine slaughter or be approved for inclusion in by-products by FDA.  Cost for individual animal ID devices must be appropriate for the animal commodity in which it is used.  Equipment that reads the ID devices must meet international standards and be capable of reading devices manufactured by other vendors. These readers should be capable of outputting results in an electronic format to a database that can transfer the data to the national ID tracking system. 

  

Specific areas of interest include proven technologies, hardware, software, integrated system concepts, and industrial capabilities along with an estimate of the magnitude of resources necessary (to include Research, Development, Test, + Evaluation (RDT+E), Production, and other Government Cost) to field this capability by the end of September 30, 2005.  This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request For Proposal (RFP), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government 
does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to 
otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
  
Any responses received will not be used as a proposal. 

2. Company responses are to include a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with government representatives.  Company responses should include a one page cover letter, a narrative summary 
and an annotated briefing (i.e. notes pages format).  Companies are not limited to a single response.  Submissions are due within 30 days of this announcement and may be made by e-mail or mailing your response on a compact disk to:

<SUBJECT>A--Quantum Information Sciences
<DESC>DESCRIPTION.  This Broad Area Announcement (BAA), in combination with its supplemental attachments and web site, constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this notice be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Quantum Information Science (QIS) Program is open to all research and development organizations, whether located in the U.S. or not, including large and small businesses; academic and eligible non-profit and not-for-profit institutions; collaborative ventures from mixed sources; and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs).  In the future, ARDA intends to release other BAAs through the Army Research Office, and possibly other agencies, addressing related topics.  ARDA reserves the right to unilaterally redirect white papers and proposals to such other BAAs as it deems appropriate.  Please refer to http://www.aro.army.mil and http://nbc.gov/qis.html for more information on related BAAs. INTRODUCTION.  The Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition and Property Management Division, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca, Arizona, acting as the contracting agent for the Intelligence Community's Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA), is issuing this BAA to solicit research and research support proposals addressing innovative research in the field of quantum information science.  Quantum mechanics promises physically secure transmittal of information as well as tremendous speed-up of computation through non-classical operations.  This work package seeks to elucidate, control, and exploit quantum phenomena for revolutionary advancement of computation and secure communication.  In addition, it seeks to accelerate development of ancillary technology critical to common areas of research.   Multiple awards are possible with typical periods of performance of 12 to 24 months with the possibility of option years including final reports and/or demonstrations.  The program will have the ability to handle rapidly changing constraints and anticipates awards up to a total value of approximately $8 million over 2 years.  All awards will be subject to critical milestone reviews on an annual basis, at which time option and continuation decisions will be made. The information in this BAA announcement is supplemented by a Proposer's Information Pamphlet (PIP).  It provides further information on the eligibility, research areas, multidisciplinary approaches, preparation and submission of proposals and selection criteria.  The PIP is available on the Internet at http://nbc.gov/qisbaa.html.  The PIP may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, or ground mail by sending a request to the Department of the Interior, Fort Huachuca by electronic mail to Lawrence_H_Carter@nbc.gov or by calling 520.533.1213.   PROGRAM BACKGROUND.  ARDA seeks innovative research to support and advance its quantum information science objectives.  The Quantum Information Science Roadmaps are published at http://qist.lanl.gov/.  This includes the Quantum Communication Roadmap and the Quantum Computation Roadmap (version 2 now posted) providing background technical information and summarizing the main technology areas comprising the current programs.  The Roadmaps also discuss the overall status of each technology area and some of the major strengths and weaknesses.  In general, proposals must explicitly identify which of the milestone(s) of the Roadmap(s) are being addressed or have a compelling explanation for why they are not consistent with those milestones.    PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.  There are four (4) major areas of interest within the program: 1.  Quantum Computation.  The long-term objective of quantum computing is to provide new and radically different computational capabilities going beyond classical computers.  While quantum computing may ultimately entail the assembly and manipulation of large numbers of quantum bits (qubits), experimental demonstrations of quantum logic performed on several quantum bits operating simultaneously would currently represent a significant advance.  Demonstrations of quantum feedback or error correction for multiple quantum bit systems are also of interest.  In addition to physical implementations of quantum computing, there is strong interest in developing new quantum algorithms providing new methods for solving classically intractable problems or that greatly improve on existing classical algorithms (e.g., in speed or memory requirements).   2.  Quantum Communication.  The ability to transmit information through quantum channels and especially to exploit entanglement between spatially separated quantum entities has opened the possibility for a means of communication with security based on physical principles and laws, rather than mathematical algorithms.  The objective here is two-fold; advanced quantum cryptography systems, and communication of quantum information based on distributed entanglement such as in quantum teleportation.  Experimental demonstration of innovative entanglement-based quantum cryptography systems is of particular interest.  Of further interest is the demonstration of long-range quantum entanglement, entanglement transfer among different quantum systems and long-term quantum memory.   	3.  Supporting Fundamental Studies.  One objective is to ascertain the limits of the ability to create, control, and utilize quantum information in multiple quantum entities in the presence of noise.  Experimental investigations of coherence properties, decoherence mechanisms, decoherence mitigation, entanglement, nondestructive measurement, complex quantum state manipulation, and quantum feedback are of interest.  Of particular interest is demonstration of coherent quantum state manipulation on time scales much faster than decoherence times.  Physical systems promising scalability to many quantum bits and quantum operations will receive the greatest attention.  Theoretical analyses of non-classical phenomena may also be of interest if the work is strongly coupled to a specific experimental investigation, as may proof-of-concept demonstrations in atomic, molecular, and optical systems or in solid-sate systems.  Only fundamental studies advancing the goals of objectives 1 and 2, above, will be considered for funding under this BAA. 4.  Supporting Ancillary Technology Efforts.  Certain experimental investigations discussed in objectives 1 through 2, above, may require special technologies or devices difficult to procure, or commercially unavailable.  For these cases, special efforts may be needed whose objective would be either to develop and demonstrate, or to design, procure, and possibly improve technology critical to any of ARDA's quantum information science programs.  A web site will be set up to provide details and expand on changing requirements.  (An example of what might be provided on the web site may help here:  ARDA's Quantum Communications programs have particular interest in robust high speed (perhaps >100 KHz or >100 MHz) single photon and entangled photon-pair sources at visible to communications wavelengths.  Similarly, single and number resolving photon detectors exhibiting high (>90% or >99%) quantum efficiency, high speed (>100 KHz or >100MHz) and relatively low dark count rates are of interest.  Additional examples of interest to the quantum efforts might include low loss (<0.1%) optical components and fibers, e.g., low loss blue and 1.5 micron friendly optics and fibers, optical UV switches (>40dB isolation), stable high speed (GHz) lasers, solid state 200-400nm sources, photon/quantum storage constructions, and demonstrations of plasmonic constructions for photon entanglement transport.) SUBMISSION PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for proposal preparation costs.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or to any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  If a contract or subcontract(s) with a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) is proposed, offerors are reminded of the limitations in their use (see FAR 35.017) and must provide documentation in the proposal that work is not otherwise available from the private sector.  Each proposal shall reflect the potential for commercial application and the benefits expected to accrue from this commercialization.  Technology transition efforts, partners, or plans should be explicitly discussed.   Three Step Idea Submission Process Step 1--Initial Contact:  An informal initial contact paper is required in which the desired outcome and duration of the proposed research is succinctly stated, and which contains a single overall approximate budget figure (i.e. a "rough order of magnitude" budget) for the research.  The 1 page initial contact papers must be written in English and submitted as a letter sized page (8.5' x 11.5' sheet with margins no smaller that .75') in a single PDF or Microsoft Word formatted file with a font and pitch of Times New Roman 10. These are submitted to the following e-mail address:  Lawrence_H_Carter@nbc.gov.  The email subject line will contain the following:  ARDA-QIS BAA 04-02-MT, Initial Contact Paper  Initial contact papers will be contain two sections, the first will be a standard cover sheet, found at Attachment 1 of the PIP, which contains pertinent administrative information and the second section being a one page project summary described above.  Initial contact papers exceeding one page (not including the standard cover sheet) and/or not containing all the required information WILL NOT be considered.  ARDA uses this initial contact submission to minimize unnecessary paperwork on the part of the submitter and determine the interest for and value of the proposed effort to the applicable programs.  ARDA will generally respond to initial contact papers within one month of their receipt. Evaluation Factors for Initial Contact Papers 1.  Potential contribution of the research to quantum computing and quantum communication, fundamental studies or ancillary technologies missions as specified by the proposed objective/outcome, the linkage to specific efforts supported, and the linkage to the roadmaps found at http://qist.lanl.gov and  2.

<SUBJECT>B -- Invitation to AMC Industry Day at Scott AFB IL 1-2 Sep 2004
<DESC>Air Mobility Command (AMC), is hosting AMC Industry Day 2004 at Scott AFB, IL 1-2 Sep 2004.  The objective of this event is to provide Air Mobility Command’s (AMC) strategic roadmap to industry and research conduits in a symposium like atmosphere.  Each directorate within AMC will have the opportunity to share their ‘way ahead’ briefings to a keenly interested audience.  

Industry Day provides a legal yet dynamic environment for information flow from the command to the senior leaders in the commercial and research/academic sectors.  Industry and research conduits gain by gathering a first hand understanding of AMC’s priorities and mission direction in the near, mid, and long terms.  Air Mobility Command gains from products better suited to AMC’s requirements, at lower costs, and within the desired timeframes.

By sharing our vision with the leaders and representatives of industry and research centers, we hope to give them the opportunity to match their strategies with our strategic mission view.  

Our ultimate goals are effective products, at affordable costs, ready to perform the mission when we need them to support the national military strategy.

<SUBJECT>D -- Invitation to AMC Industry Day at Scott AFB IL 1-2 Sep 2004
<DESC>Air Mobility Command (AMC), is hosting AMC Industry Day 2004 at Scott AFB, IL 1-2 Sep 2004.  The objective of this event is to provide Air Mobility Command’s (AMC) strategic roadmap to industry and research conduits in a symposium like atmosphere.  Each directorate within AMC will have the opportunity to share their ‘way ahead’ briefings to a keenly interested audience.  

Industry Day provides a legal yet dynamic environment for information flow from the command to the senior leaders in the commercial and research/academic sectors.  Industry and research conduits gain by gathering a first hand understanding of AMC’s priorities and mission direction in the near, mid, and long terms.  Air Mobility Command gains from products better suited to AMC’s requirements, at lower costs, and within the desired timeframes.

By sharing our vision with the leaders and representatives of industry and research centers, we hope to give them the opportunity to match their strategies with our strategic mission view.  

Our ultimate goals are effective products, at affordable costs, ready to perform the mission when we need them to support the national military strategy.

<SUBJECT>78 -- WAIVER OF NONMANUFACTURER RULE - SPORTING & ATHLETIC GOODS MANUFACTURING
<DESC>The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Sporting and Athletic Goods Manufacturing. The basis for waivers is that no small business manufacturers are supplying these classes of products to the Federal government.  The effect of a waiver would be to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.  DATE: Comments and sources must be submitted on or before August 13, 2004.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 205-7280; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act, (Act)15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product.  This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.406 (b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR 121.1204, in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding systems.  The first coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The second is the Product and Service Code established by the Federal Procurement Data System.  The SBA received a request on June 29, 2004 to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Sporting and Athletic Goods Manufacturing.  In response, SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Sporting and Athletic Goods  Manufacturing, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 339920.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule for this NAICS code. 
AUTHORITY:  15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is FA8901-04-M-3028 and is issued as a Request for Quote.

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 334516 and the business size is 500 employees.  The request is for the purchase of lab equipment for the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine.  Specifically these items are a ChemiDoc XRS System, SmartspecTM Plus Spectrophotometer and an iCycler Thermal Cycler from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.   The function of the ChemiDoc XRS System is to capture high-resolution digital images of electrophoretic gels using visible and UV light, as well as various chemiluminesencent and fluorescent (variable wavelengths) probes used in protein detection systems.  The function of the SmartSpec™ Plus Spectrophotometer is to determine the amount of RNA, DNA or protein that is present in dilute aqueous biological samples.  The function of the iCycler Thermal Cycler instrument is to control temperature in order to facilitate amplification of DNA by use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).  The items being requested are the only equipment that meets the requirements for the Clinical Investigations Branch.  The purchase of these instruments directly from Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. is in the best interests of the Air Force because only these instrument systems have all the unique features that are required to perform tasks of interest to the Air Force.  In addition, the Clinical Investigations Branch did “in laboratory” demonstrations and testing of several instruments, as well as compared other sources of these and comparable instruments (Kodak, Beckman-Coulter, Perkin-Elmer, Roche, Alpha Innotech and others) and concluded that only these Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. instruments had the unique, quality features needed and they could not all be found in other companies instruments of comparable technological classification.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the September 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 97-27.  This acquisition is NOT small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541990.  This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure Relais user license, maintenance and support on a sole source basis from Relais International Inc., Canada.  In 1996, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) purchased the Relais Enterprise system to automate the processing and handling of over 400,000 DOCLINE requests which reach NLM for distribution to the Collection Access Section and the History of Medicine Division.  Additionally, the system is used to automate the processing, sorting, and accounting for over 13,000 requests submitted by NLM's patrons using the Locatorplus System to submit requests using the Overnight Photocopy Service.  NLM has a requirement for an automated system that can accept orders from multiple external sources in different formats.  The system must identify the requestor, sort documents according to their library location, redirect orders alternate holdings when items are unavailable, manage exception handling for problem orders, convert documents to the format the client requested (e.g. fax, digital, paper), transmit the document to the client, determine billing amounts, and it must know where the order is in the system at all times.  Benefits of the system must include reductions in labor requirements and reduced cycle times for fulfilling ILL.  NLM requires that the system be MS Windows compliant.  It must be network-based and operate under the Novell LAN environment.  The system must run on Oracle.  The system must operate with scanners capable of reproducing journal articles at the rate of 21 pages per minute.  Only Relais International's Relais system carries the unique capabilities which fit the above stated requirements of the NLM.  No other product on the market that has been developed for automating library services provides the capabilities of this system or is suitable for this environment.  The Relais System is a proprietary product of Relais International, Inc.  Since Relais International, Inc. is the sole owner of the Relais System, NLM has determined that Relais International, Inc., is the only source with the previous experience and expertise capable of providing the necessary technical support and system upgrades.  Additionally, during the year we need technical support from Relais International, Inc., for Relais version 4.1.  As part of the license renewal agreement, NLM will receive software upgrades for the Relais Enterprise free of charge.  All proposals received within fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office by August 19, 2004 from the date of publication of this notice, and must meet the criteria requirement.  The quoter shall include all information which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.  All responses from responsible sources will be considered.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to change the set-aside code, the date for receipt of proposals, and to answer a question from a potential offeror.  Following the statement - It is anticipated that three awards will be made as a result of this solic itation delete the following:  One award will be made via a service-disabled veteran-owned small business set-aside.  One award will be made via a small business set-aside and the other award will be made through full and open competition.  Following the s tatement - It is anticipated that three awards will be made as a result of this solicitation insert the following:  Of the three awards, at least one will go to service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  The date for receipt of proposals is changed fr om 23 August 2004 to 31 August 2004.  Question:  With respect to the subject solicitation, we request clarification of the response to previous questions regarding the 51% rule.  Several previous questions were answered to indicate that 51% of the work mus t be achieved by the PRIME CONTRACTOR.  Please clarify.  The ruling which authorizes SDVOSB set-asides is 46 CFR parts 2,3,6 et al.  Germane to this issue is section 53-219-27(c)(1) which states:  (1) Services (except construction), at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance will be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.  If this is the governing rule, then more than 50% of the work must be done by Service D isabled Veteran Owned Compan(IES), not simply the singular SDVOSB as the answer implies.  Answer:  The contractor is correct.  At least 50% of the cost of personnel for contract performance will be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other S DVOSB concerns under a non-construction service contract.  The offeror shall acknowledge all amendments in his proposal.
