This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NICHD-17-176 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541380 and the business size standard is 1000 employees. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intend to contract on a sole source basis with University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware Street, SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, for the services of Kidney Biopsy Processing, Imaging, and Morphometric Measurements.
<p>Tasks to be performed<br />1. Processing<br /> A. Embed kidney tissue in paraffin and EPON according to protocol.<br />2. Light microscopy<br /> a. 	Cut and stain an adequate number of semi-thin (0.5-1.0 micron) sections to provide the light microscopic images described below and the electron microscopic images described in #2.<br /> b. 	Imaging:<br />40X: 2 randomly chosen fields/section (on at least 6 sections) for detennination of  fractional interstitial area<br />5X: photo montage of each thick section in its entirety to provide images (profiles) of 15-20 glomeruli per patient for detennination of glomerular area<br />3. Transmission electron microscopy<br />A. From 0.5-1micron sections stained with toluidine blue, randomly choose 3 glomeruli that are intact, not distorted and not globally sclerotic. Choose among the center-most glomeruli, or the ones least affected by mechanical artifact. Trim the block for transmission electron microscopy, cut (gold to silver, 60-90 nm) and stain (lead citrate, uranyl acetate) ultra-thin sections to be imaged as below.<br />B. Digital Imaging:<br />3000X: photomontage of3 complete glomerular profiles (25-30 fields/glomerulus)<br />12000X: 20 systematically uniformly sampled images of the glomerular capillary<br />wall per glomerulus (total of 60 images)- e.g. every 7111 "frame" from topto-<br />bottom, left-to-right (moving one frame further, if the 7111 frame does not<br />contain capillary wall)<br />4. Measurements by light microscopy<br />A. Cortical fractional volume of interstitial [Vv(int/cortex)] and atrophic tubules/total<br />tubules. (Vv(AT/TT)].<br />B. Glomerular volume by Weibel Gomez method and arteriolar hyalinosis index (IAH).<br />C. Percent global glomerular sclerosis.<br />5. Measurements by electron microscopy<br />A. Classical Diabetic Glomerulopathy Parameters: GBM width, mesangial fractional<br />volume [Vv(Mes/glom)], mesangial matrix fractional volume [Vv(MM/glom)],<br />mesangial cell fractional volume [Vv(MC/glom)], and filtration surface density<br />[Sv(PGBM/glom)], will be obtained using unbiased and validated methods used for<br />all other biopsies in this protocol.<br />B. Foot Process Width (FPW): Mean FPW will be estimated on peripheral GBM as the reciprocal of filtration slit length density [Ls(SP/GBM)] on peripheral GBM on<br />35,000 X images.<br />C. Podocyte Detachment from GBM and endothelial fenestration on the peripheral<br />capillary luminal surface will be estimated using a line intercept counting method.<br />D. Podocyte number: MPSI, a modification of the original point-sampled intercept<br />(OPSI) method, is an unbiased, efficient, shape-independent method for estimating<br />particle size. We changed the sampling strategy to reduce the volume-weighted<br />property ofOPSI. Now all nuclear profiles (as opposed to only those sampled by a<br />point grid in OPSI) are included and each nucleus receives only one set of intercept measurements through a random point (as opposed to multiple measurements if a nucleus is hit by multiple points in OPSI). Montage images of complete glomerular profiles will be prepared. Podocyte nuclei will be identified and numbered. A point/lattice grid with points 21 &mu;m apart will be super-imposed on the images. This grid has enough point density to have at least one-point fall on every podocyte nucleus. On each podocyte nucleus, one point will be randomly selected using a random number generator. An intercept line will be passed through this sampling point in two perpendicular directions. Nuclear diameter along the intercept lines will be measured according to OPSI using the Adobe Photoshop measuring tool.</p>
<p>To ensure valid comparisons across biopsies, all need to be processed and measured by the same method and in the same laboratories by the same personnel.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Intramural Research Program (IRP) conducts biomedical research and training related to diabetes mellitus; endocrine, bone, and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, including liver diseases and nutritional disorders; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases. Intramural research is conducted in the Institute's laboratories and clinical facilities in Bethesda, Maryland and in Phoenix, Arizona.  There are currently 19 Laboratories and Branches (i.e. 19 departments with different focus areas) in the NIDDK Intermural Research Program.</p>
<p>Most if not all these areas of research, either occasionally or on an ongoing basis, require advanced fluorescence microscopy, including confocal microscopy, as the basis of a quantitative assay or to qualitatively complement other assays.  The Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope (SDC) was originally purchased to satisfy such a need.  Spinning disk confocal microscopy has been, and remains the best technology to image live cultured cells, labeled with fluorescent markers, over time.  The LERB SDC thus provides a useful technology resource for other NIDDK departments outside LERB.</p>
<p>Although the LERB SDC is useful to some in its current state, it requires upgrades to keep pace with technology and users' wishes for experiments.  It is not nearly as sensitive nor as fast as what is currently available on the market, and several NIDDK researchers have not been able to pursue experiments that would greatly advance their studies.  Because this SDC has hardware-based autofocus and the capability to turn lasers on/off within a few microseconds, whereas other SDCs in NIDDK do not have these features, it is the most cost-effective to upgrade this SDC to current technology, to answer researchers' experimental requirements.<br />All tasks need to be compatible with existing hardware and functionality of this Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope.  Replacement of the existing CCD camera (NIH keeps the old camera) with dual 3rd-generation CMOS cameras:<br />Low light sensitivity and background noise reduction at least as good as the Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 v3.</p>
<p>Pixel size when using a 100x lens should be 50-80 nm in the sample space.<br />Software supports simultaneous or sequential imaging with the two cameras.<br />Images from the two cameras can be aligned in a few minutes by trained NIH staff after changing the dichroic between the two cameras.</p>
<p>Timing of camera acquisition is synchronized with laser on/off on a sub-millisecond time scale.&nbsp; Addition of piezo stage insert to enable much faster movements in between image acquisitions during z-stacks, with sub-msec synchronization with lasers and cameras.</p>
<p>The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition.
