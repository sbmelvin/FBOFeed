SPECIFICATIONS:


USDA, AMS, Cotton Program requests budgetary pricing for a cotton loose removal system as described in this document for the Quality Assurance Branch located at 3275 Appling Road Memphis, Tennessee. Quotes submitted must be in accordance with this announcement, federal, state, and local regulations.  

The selection of source for the cotton loose removal system will be based on cost first, ability to show reliability and ease of maintenance second, and reputation of distributor/manufacturer third.

DEFINITIONS

Contractor -	as referred to in this document shall designate the company awarded the contract for providing and installing the specified system.

Cotton Loose Removal System   -	as referred to in this document denotes a system that utilizes a high pressure closed vacuum consisting of high pressure piping, valves, controls, separator, exhauster, etc. for a complete working system.

Cotton Samples  - as referred to in this document denotes a cotton sample consisting of two portions, each portion is approximately six (6) inches wide, twelve (12) inches long and four (4) inches deep.  Each portion weighs approximately four (4) ounces for a total sample weight of eight (8) ounces.

Process Described

The Quality Assurance Branch contains instruments and classers that test, grade and dispose of approximately 1000 cotton samples per hour.  The Quality Assurance Branch contains 14 instrument stations that test and dispose of a small portion of the sample.  There are 8 manual classer stations of which predominantly only 4 dispose of the entire sample.  However, on occasion all 8 stations would be required to dispose of samples based on the daily cotton grading demands.  The workstations combined will dispose of approximately 500-700 pounds of cotton per hour.  Although the majority of the entire sample is disposed of at the classer station, there are times that the instrument station will be required to dispose of the entire sample.  Therefore, the loose system shall provide the flexibility of disposing of an entire sample at either workstation.  Both of the workstations are able to accommodate the holding of approximately two or three samples prior to disposal.  Therefore, the system shall empty each of the workstations in the required amount of time so as to limit the amount of samples that are accumulated between evacuations to only three.  The loose removal system at each of the workstations shall be controlled by a timed sequence activation of the valves through some type of automated control system via a PLC.  A manual push button device at the HVI and classer workstations is not acceptable.

Three additional loose removal stations (floor sweeps) shall be provided in three separate rooms for the manual removal of waste cotton that is accumulated on the floor.  The classing lab, receiving room and the bale press room shall contain the floor sweeps.  The three additional stations shall be manually controlled by a push button or similar device that shall be designed to work in conjunction with the automated loose removal described above for the HVI and classer workstations.  The additional loose removal stations shall be able to accommodate the same size of sample that was outlined in the previous paragraph.

The Quality Assurance Branch is required to operate under various scenarios based on the samples that are to be tested.  This requires a great deal of flexibility within their lab.  The following scenarios must be provided for in the design of flexibility of the installed loose removal system.  A design layout and procedure shall be submitted prior to the award to verify that these requirements are satisfied.

Cotton samples are received in the receiving room and transported by conveyors into the lab for manual classing.  The cotton samples are then transported to the HVI for testing.  Once the HVI has tested the cotton samples, the samples are transported into the receiving room and discarded at a central dumpstation.

Cotton samples are received in the receiving room and transported by conveyors into the lab for HVI testing.  Once the samples are tested, they are transported to the manual classing station.  After the samples have received a manual classification, they are discarded at the manual classer station.  There are four to eight manual classer stations that shall be used at various times for the disposal of the cotton samples.

Cotton samples are received in the receiving room and transported by conveyors into the lab for manual classing.  The cotton samples are then transported to the HVI for testing.  Once the HVI has completed the testing, the samples are discarded at the HVI workstation.  There are 14 HVI workstations that shall be capable of discarding the entire sample.



Installation Requirement

The piping and valve installation in the classing lab shall adhere to the following requirements.  The piping and valves shall be installed within the constraints of the above ground conveyor system and the finished floor level.  It shall also be contained within the support frames of the conveyor.  The piping shall be attached to the floor or frame of the conveyor to provide a stationary installation.  These dimensions are approximately 34 inches wide by 20 inches tall.  Each valve shall accommodate the loose removal for two workstations.  The piping in the receiving room shall turn into the trench within 4 feet of the separating wall of the lab and receiving room.  The underground trench is approximately 4 feet deep by 4 feet wide and contains a belt conveyance system that is approximately 2 feet tall and 3 feet wide.  The piping shall not interfere with the sample flow on the trench as it will be maintained for a backup system to the newly installed air loose removal system.

The installation shall provide for the utilization of the trench conveyance system as a backup system.  Therefore the conveyance system and the air system shall be designed and installed to allow both systems to simultaneously feed into the Quality Assurance bale press in the event of a malfunction of the Classing Office bale press.  This shall require some additional sheet metal work in the Quality Assurance bale press in the form of a slide or chute that will feed the cotton into the bale press and allow the conveyor to cross feed onto the slide or into a chute.

The receiver tanks will be suspended above the baler on an 8’x 20’ platform with access ladder and guard rails.  The system will be PLC controlled with panel mounted operator interface for adjustment of CYCLE TIME, TANK DUMP TIME, and FLOOR FILTER CLEAN TIME.  The 36”x 36” x 8” NEMA 12 panel will also include vacuum exhauster controls fire protection interlock with dry contacts, and vacuum exhauster surge controls.

The exhauster and the secondary filter shall be mounted on the floor of the bale press room.  The exhaust air from the exhauster shall be piped outside the building from the bale press room within close proximity of the exhauster.   These locations shall be approved by a USDA representative prior to installation.

<DESC>The John D. Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Wayne State University, Division of Molecular Medicine and Genomics for  cDNA microarrays.  The proposed contract action is for purchase of high density oligonucleotide microarrays needed to investigate the hypothesis that Osteonectin, TIMP-1 and Intelectin gene expressions are markers of malignant transformation of mesothelial cells to mesothelioma, which will help define the prognosis of patients with MPM, and influence pathways associated with the pathogenesis of mesothelima.  A preliminary data set has already been identified utilizing the Wayne State Molecular Laboratory.  The results provided a molecular signature of twenty-seven genes that could distinguish survival outcome of twenty-one mesothelioma patient tumor samples.  It is imperative to the research studys' accuracy that the same microarray chip methodology and hybridization conditions be utilized in further studies to achieve significance in the correlations of clinical parameters with the prognostication of these patient samples.  The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i)(A).  All FAR provisions and clauses may be reviewed and/or obtained from the General Service Internet address:  http://www.arnet.gov/far.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation documents will be issued.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses received, is solely the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Firms that believe they can meet the VA’s requirements must submit proof to the Contracting Officer no later than Sept 27, 2004.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for services and components to upgrade an existing Polytec,Inc.-manufactured scanning laser vibrometer. Researchers in the Structural Dynamics Branch are involved in measuring the vibration of a wide variety of structures. A scanning laser vibrometer system offers the capability of measuring vibrations with zero mass loading, rapid data collection from a large array of measurement points, and insensitivity to environmental conditions. Because the laser system acquires data at multiple points sequentially, it is imperative that the system does so very rapidly to minimize the overall measurement time, particularly for large structures.     This requires very precise and repeatable geometry control of the laser beam. The upgrade to the PSV-400 will expand NASA's test capability, but still be backwardly compatible with NASA's existing software algorithms. The new PSV-400 will significantly expand and improve NASA's test capabilities by providing improved laser optical performance via auto focusing of the beam at each measurement location, improved signal conditioning, and most significantly by providing a geometry scan engine that is used to measure the test measurement geometry with an accuracy of better than ~1 mm at over 30 meters distance.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the services and components from Polytec, Inc. as only Polytec, Inc. has the capabilities to meet the government's upgrade requirements of the government-owned Polytec-manufactured laser.  The sole source authority for this requirement is FAR 13.5 procedures.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 15, 2004 such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

	The work under this contract may include, but is not limited to designs and/or studies for construction, renovation, and maintenance of various Navy waterfront facilities, including utilities.  Primary work will be the preparation of plans and specifications for design/build or fully designed contracts to accomplish either renovation or new construction projects.

SELECTION CRITERIA AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:  The criteria are listed in descending order of importance as follows:  Criteria 1, Recent Experience; Criteria 2, Professional Qualifications; Criteria 3; Past Performance; Criteria 4; Quality Control; Criteria 5, Capacity; Criteria 6, Sustainable Design; Criteria 7, Location; Criteria 8, Commitment to Small Business Concerns; and Criteria 9, Volume of Work.  
Proposals will be evaluated to determine which firm is considered the most highly qualified based on the criteria responses.  Evaluating past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, inquiries with previous customers, from Government databases, and any other known publicly available sources.  The failure to provide requested data, or providing a point of contact that is inaccessible or without a valid phone number, could result in a firm being considered less qualified.  The evaluation of past performance will consider whether the firm has consistently demonstrated quality work, including the team’s record of recommending innovative approaches and/or technologies; adherence to schedules; and history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction.  A proposal that has no record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available, shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  The following elements may result in a firm being considered to have higher qualifications during the evaluation and should be addressed accordingly when preparing each of the criteria responses:  a) Projects completed within the last five (5) years; b) projects directly related to a wide range of waterfront and marine facilities, but with an emphasis on marine facilities (piers, dry-docks, etc.), and industrial waterfront shops and facilities; c) projects with an estimated construction cost of $100,000 to $10M; d) projects involving a sustainable design approach; and e) design-build projects.

<DESC>NIAID is establishing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit proposals to address the Institute’s need for improving the immune response of immunocompromised individuals to vaccines and immunotherapies that defend against NIAID Category A, B, or C priority pathogens (listed at http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).  The purpose of the BAA is to solicit proposals for research programs that focus on either:  1) the discovery of basic biological mechanisms that cause these immune deficits (Research Area 1); or 2) testing of treatments that are designed to increase the safety and efficacy of such vaccines and immunotherapies in immunocompromised populations (Research Area 2).  The ultimate goal of this research program is to protect the human population from potential bioterrorism agents.  Therefore, it is expected that research results will provide information that ultimately contributes to the development of new or improved vaccines and/or immunotherapeutic treatments that target the human population, with a focus on immunocompromised individuals.  It is anticipated that five (5) to (10) cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded, each with a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately September 30, 2005.  RFP-NIAID-DMID-BAA-05-11 will be available electronically on or about October 5, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for other than commercial items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) to develop and manufacture human or human compatible monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for evaluation in preclinical and clinical studies as therapies for botulism.  Monoclonal Abs proposed by the offeror for development under this RFP should have demonstrated potency in a standardized mouse protection bioassay for botulinum neurotoxins serotypes A1 and A2 approximately equivalent to or better than the licensed botulinum equine anti-toxin. 
The Project BioShield Act of 2004, enacted on July 21, 2004, authorizes the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), through the program carried out by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to simplify and expedite the award of contracts to perform or support research and development of countermeasures determined by the Secretary to be a priority to treat, identify, or prevent harm from any biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent that may cause a public health emergency affecting national security, or adverse health consequences that may arise from using such a countermeasure.  Consistent with this new authority, NIAID is announcing this simplified acquisition.

The growing terrorist threat of radiological or nuclear attack includes a range of possibilities beyond those historically envisioned.  In addition to detonation of a nuclear bomb, the civilian population may be at risk from radiological dispersion devices such as dirty bombs that utilize discarded nuclear materials, as well as attacks upon nuclear reactor facilities.  No medical countermeasures or detection programs currently exist within a federal civilian research institution to address these needs.  The urgent, general need for medical countermeasures and detection methods against radiation injury, and the particular need for methods to reliably prevent immune damage from radiation or to reconstitute both short-and-long term immune functions after exposure, underlie the creation of this targeted initiative.

<DESC>The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requires a Sole Source bridge contract with Northrop Grumman Information Technology to allow for uninterrupted critical IT support services between the expiration of Technology Enterprise Automation Management Support (TEAMS) contract and the time its replacement is in full operation.  The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) and 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1) per FAR 6.302-1(c)(2). 

This is an interim action intended to ensure continuity of support by providing a temporary "bridge" contract between the GSA TEAMS contract GS00T02ACA2582 and the competitively awarded successor contract for a TEAMS II. The period of performance will be from December 2004 through no later than June 2005. The bridge contract will allow for the continuation of services that are being provided under the competitively awarded contract GS00T02ACA2582   The bridge contract is required for the orderly transition of multiple access modes to the web-based system under the competitively awarded contract.  This access ranges from traditional networked desktop services to portable and wireless systems. TEAMS support is comprised of the following support task areas: The Integrated Help Desk, Network Operations Center and Security Operations Center, Desktop-Server Support (Field Support to over 2000 separate sites nationwide)
·	Hardware Maintenance Support
·	Security Operations Support
·	Asset Management
·	IT Infrastructure Deployment
·	Excess Equipment Warehouse
·	ADP Operations Support
·	IT Infrastructure Cable Plant Support
·	Contractor program management services. The uninterrupted critical IT support services between the expiration of Technology Enterprise Automation Management Support (TEAMS) contract and the time its replacement is in full operation.  Substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements for a critical system would result in a break in service for this critical support system. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government shall consider all responses received by the date identified above. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a Draft RFQ to evaluate industries interest and suggestions in the acquisition process to the Army's need to improve the quality of transient lodging for Soldiers and families on temporary duty and permanent change of station travel.  Based u pon a recent study, approximately 80% of Army Lodging's on-post inventory does not meet minimum quality standards.  The primary cause of this problem is rooted in a severe and persistent funding shortfall resulting in failure to adequately revitalize facil ities through appropriate levels of construction, replacement, and/or major maintenance and repair.  The Army concluded that the preferred method to help solve the transient lodging upgrade problem, along with the issue of long-term facility sustainment, w ould be to leverage existing transient lodging and land assets in partnership with the private sector.  This program, called the Privatization of Army Lodging,PAL, seeks to apply private sector expertise, resources, and market-based incentives to improve t he quality of life for soldiers and their families while in a transient status.  The objective is to provide quality, on-post hotel accommodations that meet the varying needs of a mobile military community through improvements to the on-post lodging invent ory and/or new construction where indicated.  The PAL program was developed and is managed under the oversight and direction of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of The Army, Installations and Environment, OASA, I&E,on behalf of the Secretary of The Army.  The Army believes that lodging privatizat ion provides an excellent opportunity for addressing the transient needs of America's soldiers and their families while providing an attractive business opportunity for its private partners.  The PAL program will be approached in  phases, each phase consis ting of a single project group encompassing multiple installations.  This Draft RFQ is specific to phase one of PAL implementation,the Group A project. Overview This requirement is being pursued under the Alternative Authority for Acquisition and Improvement of Military Housing legislation, 10 USC 2871-2885, enacted by Congress in 1996.  This legislation, commonly referred to as the Military Housing Privatization Initiative,MHPI, legislation, allows the military services to leverage scarce appropriated funds and extensive existing assets,land and improvements.  Additional information regarding he PAL program can be found at the following website: http://www.pal.arm y.mil/pal.  This solicitation is structured as a Request for Qualifications, RFQ.  The RFQ process will identify the best value offeror determined to be the most highly qualified to enter into a long-term business relationship with The Army to upgrade, operate and mai ntain transient lodging at all of the installations identified for the Group A project. Selection will be based upon the qualifications of the offerors as outlined by the evaluation factors and upon the basis of best value to the government.   In Step One of the solicitation process, The Army will issue an RFQ which establishes specific Minimum Experience Requirements, MERs, and seeks discussion of five general evaluation factors in a Statement of Qualifications,SOQ. The MERs have been establish ed to address the skill sets of development, hotel management, and financial capability.  Offerors who meet the MERs will be further evaluated in terms of their SOQs.  Both the MERs and SOQs should be submitted together in Step One. This first step of the RFQ process will identify those offerors determined to be highly qualified and thus eligible for further consideration for potential long-term business relationships.  The determination of this highly qualified competitive group will be based on the offero r's experience, financial capability, organizational capabilities, corporate level, past performance, and small business utilization, general history.  The offerors comprising the highly qualifi ed competitive group will be invited to participate in Step Two of the RFQ process.   During Step Two of the RFQ process, offerors in the highly qualified competitive group will compete based on the Group A project specifics.  If an offeror competes for this project, the offeror must compete for the entire project and not individual sites w ithin the project.  Step Two submissions are expected to be in the form of an oral presentation with written documentation.  The offeror will be evaluated based on its proposal addressing expected financial return, specific preliminary project concept stat ement, organizational capabilities, project level, and small business utilization and plan, project level. Offerors should not change principle members during the solicitation. The offeror will be expected to identify, in detail, its plan to achieve the following goals for each installation within the project: Ensuring that soldiers and their families have access to high quality, safe, attractive, and affordable transient lodging by upgrading or replacing existing transient lodging and, if necessary, by building new lodging to meet the transient demand at each i nstallation in the Group A project. Providing consideration for preservation of existing historic character and military culture, while protecting cultural resources and meeting environmental stewardship responsibilities.  Maintaining positive relations with all stakeholders and communities that surround the installation. Providing for the effective long-term, high quality management and operation of the transient lodging inventory, and any ancillary supporting facilities proposed. Providing for realistic financial management of the assets including viable reserves and earning a mutually acceptable return on investment for the offeror and The Army. To achieve these goals, the developer will be expected to assume ownership of any transient lodging facilities that are transferred per mutual agreement between the developer and The Army following final acceptance of the Lodging Development and Management  Plan, LDMP.  The developer will be provided a long-term interest in the underlying land. Although the focus of the PAL Project is on transient lodging, the MHPI authorities also permit the construction and/or operation of ancillary supporting facilities and activities that relate to and support the accommodation of transient soldiers and famil ies.  Such facilities/activities may include food and beverage operations, conference/meeting support functions, limited retail space, tot lots, hotel swimming pools, limited fitness facilities, kennels/pet runs, and other similar facilities for the suppor t of Army transient lodging guests.  Offerors are encouraged to evaluate the potential for any appropriate ancillary activities and to include such activities in their proposals where feasible.  The private partner's return on the project is expected to come from developing, operating, and managing existing, renovated, and/or newly constructed lodging units.  The private partner's main source of revenue will be room rates paid by military service members on official travel with or without family members.  Room rates for official travelers should be targeted at an average across the portfolio of 75% of local per diem rates.  At no time may room rates for official travelers exceed the local lodging p ortion of per diem.   Recognizing the complexity and breadth of issues that arise in planning and executing a project of this size and scope across multiple military installations, the project will be organized into two phases: Phase 1 - Project Planning.  During Phase 1, the awardee, developer, will work closely with The Army to craft the LDMP.  This will be the business plan for the project and will set forth the terms of the developer's long-term relationship with The Army.  P ayment for Phase 1 is discussed in Section 2.1.4 of this solicitation.  Phase 2 - Projec t Implementation.  During Phase 2, the developer will implement the LDMP, provided the Headquarters Department of The Army (HQDA), Office of the Secretary of Defense, OSD, Office of Management and Budget, OMB, and the Congress approve the plan, and approva l is given to consummate the LDMP and begin the transition / transfer of assets and operations. A major benefit of the LDMP process is that it allows The Army, its associated consultants, and the developer to work through issues collaboratively, and to ensure that important issues are anticipated and addressed before executing the plan.  It also prov ides an opportunity for The Army to consider proposals from the developer concerning the use of specific MHPI authorities, such as constructing certain ancillary supporting facilities.  Finally, this process gives The Army a mechanism for periodically conf erring with Congressional oversight committees during project planning, as well as with representatives from the local communities and Army-related organizations who are essential to the success of the project. The Notice to Offerors, Draft RFQ and Appendices can be viewed by following the links referenced in this Presolicitation Notice.

<SOLNBR>W912WJ-04-B-0002

<ARCHDATE>11202004
<CONTACT>Rachael  Raposa, 978-318-8249
<DESC>The New England District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been tasked by the Department of Homeland Security (former Immigration and Naturalization Service INS) to design and construct two new replacement Border Patrol Stations on the northern Maine  border, one each in Calais (Baileyville) and Jackman, Maine. These new Border Patrol Stations are required to accommodate future staff increases and are intended to replace existing stations.  Sites have been selected. In Calais, the new Border Patrol Sta tion will be constructed in the Baileyville Industrial Park on Route 1 and in Jackman, the new Border Patrol Station will be constructed on Route 6/15 in Jackman.  It is expected that construction for this project will begin during the early summer of 2004  with construction completion scheduled for one year later  early summer of 2005. Occupancy by the Border Patrol is required by mid march 2005. Because of this, a winter shutdown is not envisioned as this work must be accomplished on schedule. The Corps of  Engineers will be performing construction management services for this contract.  Work to be done hereunder includes furnishing of all labor, equipment and materials, to perform all work required for the construction of two new Border Patrol Stations as i ndicated in the plans and specifications. Each Border Patrol Station will be constructed on a minimum 10-acre site and will consist of an approximately minimum 10,000 sf commercial building with options that could potentially double the building size. The Border Patrol Stations will be constructed on wooded lots and will be slab on grade office buildings complete with systems furniture designed to operate 24 hours per day and will include enclosed dog kennels; backup generator; trash dumpster; security syst ems to include fencing; gasoline storage/dispensing; heating oil storage; and flag pole. The main building will be CMU with brick facade and gabled roof with asphalt roof shingles. With favorable contract bids, bid options may include a combination of the following: enclosed parking garage for vehicles including a wash bay, ATVs, motorcycles and snowmobiles; enclosed sally port; enclosed ASU parking; enclosed vehicle maintennance bay; a helicopter pad (Jackman); and enclosed marine bay (Calais). The constru ction of a water well and septic systems will be required at Jackman. Town water and sewer is available at Calais (Baileyville). The extension of three phase electricity to the Jackman site will be required. It is avaialble at Calais. The remote locations of these proposed Border Patrol Stations, the extreme winter weather conditions, and the expedited construction completion requirements are of the utmost concern that must be accounted for by prospective contractors. Work will be required during the winter  in order to meet the schedule. The estimated issue date is on or about January 21, 2004.  The proposed action is unrestricted.  The NAICS code is 236220 with a size standard of $28.5 million.  No paper copies of the solicitation or amendments will be avai lable. The firms interested must register to receive the solicitation.  Registration instructions are available on the Internet at http://www.nae.usace.army.mil as well as the media by which the solicitation will be made available.  Amendments, if any, to this solicitation will be made available at this Internet site.  Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests will be accepted.

requirement.asp?req_no=DHQCNT04MP60026

QUESTION 1:  In section 5.2.2, it says responses to each function must not exceed one page per product.  What was meant by a “function”?  Is 5.3.1 a function, and 5.3.2 is another function, or is 5.3.1.1 a function, and 5.3.1.2 another function?  RESPONSE:  For clarification, DISA requests all SOW paragraphs are responded to with a "concur/non-concur", "yes/no" or "compliant/non-compliant".  This ensures vendor proposals are complete, accurate and concise.  In response to the limitation, responses are limited to the lowest SOW paragraph/sub-paragraph number of each functional and operational capability (e.g., 5.3.1.1,  5.3.1.2 and 5.3.1.3  are separate functions).

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is in the process of requesting Proposals (RFP) for renovations to the Federal Building / Post Office  located at 657 Second Avenue North, Fargo, North Dakota.  GSA is soliciting contractors to participate in the “Best Value Source Selection” process for this project.  This process has been set aside for procurement under the Small Business Administration’s 8(a) Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Step One requires the offeror and major subcontractors (Electrical only) to submit a technical proposal, without pricing.  Each Offeror must be a general contractor, and each offeror must submit between two (2) and four (4) major subcontractors. Following evaluation of the Technical Proposals, the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) shall make a Competitive Range determination that will include all offerors considered to have a reasonable probability of being selected for award.  All  offerors will be allowed to continue in the Source Selection process, however, those that fall outside of the competitive range will be notified that the SSEB has determined that they do not have a reasonable probability of award.  Step Two of this procedure will require the submission of priced proposals and management plans.  Following a final evaluation of the Price and management proposals, the SSEB shall determine which offeror to award the contract to based upon its Best Value analysis.

The following is a brief description of the construction.  This project consists of all labor, equipment, material, transportation, and supervision necessary to complete this renovation.  The building was constructed in Fargo in 1969 and contains 4 stories, a basement, and a penthouse and provides a gross area of 24,121 square meters (259,635 square feet) to house approximately 404 employees.  There are 31 structured parking spaces within the building and 115 surface parking spaces in a lot adjacent to the building.  The major tenant in this building is the U.S. Postal Service, occupying 45% of the building.  Other tenants include the Internal Revenue Service, Small Business Administration, Social Security Administration, Congressional Offices, and GSA operations.  The General Construction Contractor shall be professionally licensed in the State of North Dakota.  The project will generally consist of the following scope of work: major upgrade of the electrical system, repair and replace elevators, replace and re-grade paving, complete window replacement, fire protection upgrade, handicapped accessibility upgrades, security enhancements, interior alterations, exterior façade repairs, and improvements to the postal dock.  Warranties/guarantees, finishes and related management requirements will be included.  Portions of the work, especially in occupied tenant spaces, will have to be performed during non-working hours.  Total project construction costs, including all designated Government allowances, are estimated to be in the range of $5 Million to $6 Million.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Simulation and Training Technology Center (formerly STRICOM) publicized Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-01-R-0023 in the CBD on 01 March 2001. This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, “Battlefield Simulation Research: 1-M. Embedded Simulation and Training” Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Mr. Henry Marshall, RDECOM STTC (407)384-3820, Henry.A.Marshall@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: NAVAIR-Orlando-TSD, Ms. Debra Leuschel, Contract Specialist, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or Ms. Vanessa Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: 
Demonstrate a field capable mounted/dismounted embedded training systems for the Embedded Combined Arms Team Training and Mission Rehearsal (ECATT-MR) Science and Technology Objective (STO).  These systems will lay the groundwork for future Army embedded systems that will provide deployable sustainment training and mission rehearsal for combined arms forces that accurately replicate the Contemporary Operational Environment. These systems will allow mounted/dismounted forces to train and perform mission rehearsal on demand without significant external support. The goal is to move the mounted /dismounted interoperable embedded training technologies to a Technology Readiness Level of 6 (which is a prototype demonstration in a relevant environment). A dismounted squad level unit using these systems supplemented by other embedded dismounted prototypes with one Future Combat System (FCS) Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) like vehicle will do a mission rehearsal with the system and supporting capabilities such as Mission Walkthrough and After Action Review (AAR). The utility of the system to train, perform mission rehearsal and distributed AAR under likely field conditions will be evaluated.
 
RESEARCH AREAS OF INTEREST
RDECOM STTC is interested in those technologies for future mounted/dismounted embedded training. The goal is to focus on the demonstration of a future mounted/dismounted interoperable embedded training solution for FCS Manned Ground Vehicles (MGV) and supporting dismounted forces. 

The following narrative provides an abbreviated description of the prospective research areas.  The description is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit innovative white papers/proposals that have the potential to dramatically expand and enhance the technologies to be pursued in the specific area of interest described below.  Any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals:


The research area will:

·	Fully Immersive Man wearable Dismounted Embedded Virtual Simulation – demonstrate a Man wearable virtual simulation that provides effective embedded simulation and mission rehearsal capabilities within the future hardware footprints of a Land Warrior (LW) or Future Force Warrior (FFW) like system. This requires consideration of factors like weight, battery life and man wearable human factors. Other likely technology areas for improvement include; Helmet mounted or other display technologies, Wearable Computers, Movement tracking, and movement control. The system will track the body and weapon movements of the trainee and correlate them to the virtual environment. The system will be able to provide sensor and communication capabilities to coordinate collectively with other dismounted player units and the Mounted Force which will be represented by the Future Combat System (FCS) Infantry Carrier Testbed. The system will implement a limited set of Joint Variable Message (JVMF) messages to perform mounted/dismounted coordination. The offeror will need to deliver between 1 to 4 prototypes of the player units for experimentation.

·	Creative Low Cost approaches to provide Dismounted embedded virtual and constructive Simulation – Demonstrate alternative dismounted embedded player unit designs to provide effective collective training and mission rehearsal without the complexity of the fully immersive player unit. The player unit will be within the future hardware footprints of a Land Warrior (LW) or Future Force Warrior (FFW) like system. Will have the ability to provide sensor and communication capabilities to coordinate collectively with other dismounted player units and the Mounted Force, which will be represented by the FCS Infantry Carrier Vehicle Testbed. The system will allow the player to engage the enemy with realistic results. The system will implement a limited set of JVMF messages to perform mounted/dismounted coordination. The offeror will need to deliver between 1 to 4 prototypes of the player units for experimentation.

·	Distributed / Embedded AAR – Demonstrate an AAR concept for embedded simulation. This system will utilize the Dismounted Embedded player units (both immersive and low-cost systems) and the mounted players which are represented by the FCS ICV Testbed to provide and control the AAR. Information will be distributed among the embedded player units allowing them to and participate and understand the exercise flow rather than following a more traditional AAR approach which would occur in a theater. The AAR should be simple to use and focus on usability for a unit in the field. It is envisioned that this effort would be on top of an existing AAR system with the focus being how to distribute and effectively coordinate the AAR using the embedded player units. The system will implement a limited set of JVMF messages to perform mounted/dismounted coordination.

·	Mission Planning (MP)/Walkthrough for Embedded Simulation – Demonstrate a system to perform mission planning with the embedded mounted and dismounted systems. The system will be easy to use and allow the embedded operators to provide a mission walkthrough before its execution The system will provide a 3D visualization of database, units and key points of the mission/exercise. The system will allow tactical control measures to be visible in the 3D view. Ideally the system will also support a 2D view. The system will look into supporting the behaviors of the OPposing FORce (OPFOR) by downloading OPFOR parameters into OneSAF Testbed Baseline (OTB) or OneSAF Objective System (OOS). 


·	Embedded Architecture Research – Demonstrate improved embedded architectures using FCS common components such as the OneSAF Objective system to build a streamlined embedded simulation engine. The system shall integrate with the ICV embedded test beds in the STTC lab and the dismounted embedded player units. The system shall also provide simulation of FCS robotic systems from the mounted and dismounted player units. 

·	Embedded Augmented Reality (AR) Capability – demonstrate a fully embedded augmented reality (AR) capability on one of the following platforms: 

(1)  A Land Warrior/Future Force Warrior (LW/FFW) - type surrogate, configured completely as man-wearable and untethered from any additional off-board computing and/or sensor infrastructure.  All equipment for presentation of AR to the dismounted soldier shall be carried on the soldier system.

(2)  An FCS like Manned Ground Vehicle (MGV) platform testbed - The system shall provide for the integration of data from Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) linkages and present this data as 2D/3D graphics and entities, mixed and injected into the subject field of view (display) of the real environment.  Virtual objects would include targets, special weapons effects, CGF, graphical situational awareness data, phase lines, target reference points, etc.  

The initial demonstration with the AR player units shall be provided in the STTC Lab NLT Fall 05. Final demonstration shall be in the Fall of 06, the goal of this demo is untethered under outdoor conditions.   Delivery of one prototype system shall be required.

·	Intelligent Structured Training  - Demonstrate improved embedded training and mission rehearsal capabilities through use of embedded Intelligent Tutoring Systems(ITS) to provide an Intelligent Structured Training capability. This will allow duty station task training in the vehicle without any instructors. The goal of this ITS will be to monitor tactical decision making, in real time, based upon Army Tactics, Techniques and Procedures.  The ITS should provide one-on-one feedback, or “tutoring,” to the soldier based on the quality of observed behavior.  The Intelligent Structured Training technologies shall use either the ICV or the Command and Control Vehicle testbed to integrate their products and conduct initial and final demonstrations. The ITS component will be designed to provide real time feedback to the soldier during training and mission rehearsal by providing dynamic feedback using the capabilities of the system, including the Soldier Machine Interface, 3D Audio and other such mechanisms.  The ITS will be capable of dynamically evaluating student decisions such that the scenarios and evaluations do not have to be pre-defined.  The ITS will be easy to configure and develop evaluations for real-time mission rehearsal. The ease of authoring new training scenarios is critical.  The system should interface to likely FCS components like OneSAF to provide Opposing Force (OPFOR) and friendly Computer Generated Forces (CGF) needed to train the tasks. The effort will require reports describing system design, interfaces, and ITS evaluation authoring tool and any experimental results. 


PROGRAM SCOPE
RDECOM STTC anticipates making awards in each research area with the dollar amounts for the research areas typically ranging between $100,000 to $400,000 for each.  The planned method for accomplishing the research in each prospective area is to utilize a phased approach.  Therefore, white papers submitted should be structured so that the  technical approach/solution for the proposed research area(s) address a Basic Effort (Phase I) and one (1) priced Option Effort (Phase II).  The white paper needs to address at least one of the research areas listed above and must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and planned approach to accomplish any operational demonstrations as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.   (See Phase I and Phase II information below for additional requirements).

PHASE I.  
Phase I will be a 12 month effort and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 -$400,000 per research area.  The effort will culminate in an initial demonstration in the Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC) in Fall 2005. The efforts will require reports describing the system description /design, interfaces, findings/conclusions, and any experimentation results.  The systems will be Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) interoperable with the FCS ICV Testbed and other player units. A common database(s) using Openflight format will be provided in support of the experiments 
 

PHASE II. 
Phase II will be a 12 month effort and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 -$400,000 per research area. Final Demonstration will be at the ECATT-MR STO Culminating Event in Fall 2006. This event shall demonstrate a field capable mounted/dismounted system moving the mounted /dismounted technology to a prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. A dismounted squad level unit using this system supplemented by other embedded dismounted prototypes with one FCS Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) like vehicle will do a mission rehearsal with the system and supporting elements like Mission Planning and After Action Review (AAR). The unit would then carry out the actual live training mission. The utility of the system to train and perform mission rehearsal will be evaluated.


There will be at least 2 mandatory formal technical interchange meetings during Phase 1. Each proposal shall include a statement that the offeror agrees to: a) the formal exchange of technical information with other ECATT-MR STO Programs, subject to signed non-disclosure agreements and b) participation in the interchange meetings.

<RESPDATE>092404
<ARCHDATE>10092004
<CONTACT>Sharon Osborne, Contracting Officer, Phone 202/344-1219, Fax 202/344-1254, Email sharon.osborne@dhs.gov
<DESC>A number of additional questions have been asked about the U. S. Customs and Border Protection specifications for the acquisition of Personal Radiation Detectors as described in the September 2, 2004, FedBizOps notice for solicitation RFPHSBP1004R0177.  The questions and answers are provided below for the information of all interested parties.

1)Question:  Is it permissible to hand-deliver the PRDs to your facility prior to step 1 testing?

Answer: Yes.  On, but not before, the September 24, 2004, due date.  The address is:

U.S. Customs and Border Protection
Office of Procurement, Front Desk
National Place
1331 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 1310
Washington, DC 20004

2) Question:  In the fifth paragraph of the pre-solicitation notice it states “offerors whose products pass this testing…”. However, the SOW DHSs not indicate what the pass/fail requirements and criteria are and so can you detail these for us please?

Answer: Each PRD will be evaluated against the requirements listed in the PRD SOW.  There are hard pass/fail criteria (if PRD does not meet this requirement it is eliminated) and soft criteria, which will be based on numerical scoring.  Instruments passing all the hard scoring criteria and then receiving 70% or more in the soft criteria will pass.   

3)Question:  In SOW section 2.0 (Documents) it is not clear which documents are inferred in items 3 & 4 (e.g. all ASME & all ASTM standards?) and what would be considered as the minimal requirements that one should meet and how conflicts between these many different standards would be resolved.

Answer: The applicable ASME and ASTM standards.  The main reference is the ANSI Standard N42.32.  All other references are included for completeness. 

4)Question:  In SOW section 4.1.2 (Safety) will the PRD be used in a class I, II or III, division 1 hazardous location as specified in UL 913-2002?

Answer:  Current regulations do not allow carrying of electronic devices into these environments and thus they would be removed prior to entry.

5)Question:  In SOW section 4.1.4 (Dimensions) it states optimal dimensions with a tolerance of +/-10%, DHSs this mean that physically smaller units of less than the minimum dimension are not desirable and will not be considered?

Answer: The wording was selected carefully to illustrate the OPTIMUM size for the product not to specify any particular "must have" dimensions. All products submitted shall be considered if not grossly outside these parameters.  

6)Question:  In SOW section 4.1.7 (Display) how would alternative schemes to the display methodology given in the example be judged?

Answer: The example cited is just that, an example, and is worded to convey CBP’s wish for the PRD display to show different levels of radiation intensity and the ability of the wearer to see this display when worn on the belt.  However, the following display requirement will be judged (ref: 4.1.7) “For PRD’s capable of detecting both gamma and neutrons, there shall be separate visual indicators differentiating between the type of alert.  All displays shall be readable in direct sunlight, darkness and in all ambient light conditions in-between.  The alerts and intensity readouts shall be easy to comprehend by non-technical users.”

7)Question:  In SOW section 4.1.8 (Self check) is it ok to go to normal operational mode if no problems are detected and only display errors on an exception basis?

Answer:  Yes, the purpose of this feature is for the system to conduct a self-diagnostic check and convey to the operator that it is working correctly.

8)Question:  In SOW section 4.1.10 (Search mode) as battery consumption is sighted as the reason for this mode if excellent battery consumption is achieved without this particular mode of operation (e.g. the unit is continually in search mode) how will this be evaluated? 
 
Answer:  The PRD is required to have two modes of operation: a Detect mode, 4.1.9  and  a search mode 4.1.10. Typically, entering into a search mode consumes the battery at an accelerated rate. CBP’s experience with several models separated this function of the PRD so as to conserve the batteries. Should a design be brought forward that allows for engaging the search mode with no significant increase in battery consumption it shall be acceptable.  

9)Question:  In SOW section 4.1.11 (Alarms) in sub-part 3., the intensity of the audile alarm is not quantified, how will this be evaluated?

Answer:  This is specified in ANSI Standard N42.32.  Audible alarm intensity shall be measured in dB(A) at a set distance from the PRD.

10)Question:  In SOW section 4.1.13 (Alarm threshold) to what level of gamma doserate intensity, for zero spill over into the neutron channel, is considered acceptable (e.g. would the minimum, maximum specified doserate of 3600 microrem/hour figure suffice)?

Answer: The minimum (10 microrem/hr) and maximum (3600 microrem/hr) should suffice for this purpose

11)Question:  In SOW section 5.2 (Sensitivity) the energy level for the neutron sensitivity is not specified, what is this required to be?

Answer: The neutron energy level is the same as that from a Cf-252 source.  Section 5.2 states “PRD’s capable of detecting neutrons, shall have a sensitivity of .05 counts/second per neutron/sec/cm2”.  A Cf-252 source and a 30 cm x 30 cm x 15 cm polymethylacrylate phantom will be used to measure the detection of neutrons.

12)Question:  In SOW section 5.5.1 (Temperature) to what level of temperature shock (degrees C or F/hour) should the device be able to withstand?

Answer: Temperature shock testing shall be accomplished according to ANSI Standard (N42.32).  In a matter of minutes, the temperature shall be adjusted from: 
	1) 22 °C (room temp) to 50 °C (max operating temp.) and held for thirty minutes while system operation is monitored.  In a matter of minutes, the temperature will then be lowered back to 22 °C and held for thirty minutes while system operation is monitored.   
	2) 22 °C (room temp) to - 20 °C (min operating temp.) and held for thirty minutes while system operation is monitored.  In a matter of minutes, the temperature will then be raised back to 22 °C and held for thirty minutes while system operation is monitored.  
   

13)Question:  In SOW section 5.5.4 (Impact protection) as the PRD is required to be fully operable in its supplied gun belt holder will it be drop tested in this?

Answer:  The drop test will use an unprotected PRD unit (i.e. not in the gun belt or any other external holder).

14)Question:  In SOW section 9.1 (PRD units) para. 2 requires the neutron capable units to be set to alarm at 1 neutron count/sec whereas section 4.1.13 requires 2 neutrons/cm2 /sec. What is the requirement?

Answer: The requirement is 2 neutrons/cm2 /sec.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is seeking sources to procure a Modular Wearable Computer (MOWC).  SCOPE: The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) located at Quantico, Virginia, requires an integrated Modular Wearable Computer (MOWC) to provide for the collective operation, monitoring and system status/telemetry data feed of the following unmanned sensor systems: Dragon Runner Mobile Ground Sensor/UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle), SUSS/UGS (Small Unit Sensor System/Unatt! ended Ground Sensors) and the Dragon Eye (DE) UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle).  This Statement of Work (SOW) requires the contractor to provide the necessary personnel to accomplish the tasks described below. BACKGROUND:   In today’s modern battle spaces, where potential enemies understand the United States (US) strengths and capitalize on the asymmetric nature of specific areas, small unit leaders will increasingly enter these hostile environments and encounter life-threatening situations.  The Marine Corps Warfighting Lab recognizes that tactical units need an organic suite of unmanned low-risk system capabilities to conduct Reconnaissance Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA) in these complex environments.  It is believed that an integrated MOWC will assist this mission by providing real-time RSTA data, increasing the using unit’s overall situational awareness.  This coverage, executed by an organic suite of remote sensors, and controlled/monitored off of one central MOWC! , will provide observational data of confined/distant areas where human access is impractical or unsustainable, mitigating risk to the Marines normally carrying out these missions.  Fully functional prototypes of these unmanned systems (Dragon Runner UGV and SUSS) are being developed and demonstrated by the National Robotics Engineering Consortium, Carnegie Mellon University Robotic’s Institute and the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL).  The Dragon Eye UAV, currently under system enhancement by MCWL as produced by AeroVironment, Inc, is formerly a program of record within Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia (VA).  In order to support continued experimentation by MCWL RSTA Technology section, one integrated MOWC (to include description, specifications, engineering support and operation instructions) is required for experimentation.  The MCWL will conduct experiments to determine the efficacy of such a computer system at the Marine small unit level. OBJEC! TIVE:  The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain one MOWC, to include descriptions, specifications, operation instructions that works with the Dragon Runner UGV, SUSS and Dragon Eye UAV systems, and to require and fund the Non-Recurring Expenses (NRE) associated with the integrated MOWC system, if any. The NAICS code for this requirement is 334111.  The size standard for the NAICS code is 1,000 employees.  Please articulate within your response the size of your business and any socio-economic programs that may apply.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOCUMENTATION SUBMITTED FOR THIS INFORMATION.  All interested parties shall forward the specified documentation that articulates their capabilities on or before 05 October 2004 to the Contracting Officer, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Attn:  Code XDS11H, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5100 and referenc! ed Sources Sought Announcement Number N00178-05-Q-1900.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and sources sought inquiry for salvaged sanitized military vehicles.  Responses are due for this RFI by 04 October 2004. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. This is NOT a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.

Any submissions will be considered to be public information and may be handled by non-government personnel. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents.
The Government requires 10 sanitized salvaged military vehicles.  These must be despecularized by removing all reflective or refractive material.  This can be done by removing glass, chrome, and shiny metals.  When removal is impractical, an alternative is to paint these surfaces with non-reflective paint.  Any vehicle used as a range target will have all fluids drained (except for a small amount of transmission fluid to permit the target to be dragged to the site).  Batteries, hazardous materials, and radium dials (and other heavy metals present) will be removed and will be despecularized prior to its use as a target.  All materials removed from potential targets will be disposed of as required by Federal, State, and local environmental procedures.  All vehicles used as strafing targets will have the dense metal portions (engines, transmissions, etc…) removed before being placed on the range.  Salvaged vehicles will be obtained by the government at the government’s expense from DRMO and the contractor will assume responsibility of the vehicle at the DRMO site.  Locations of this range is on the Island of Hawaii in a remote location called Pohakuloa Training Area (PTA).  The vehicles will be airlifted from the edge of the range into a predetermined spot inside the range.  
Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: · Identification of sources and interested parties · and Business size · All responses are requested to indicate if they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, or HUB zone small business, etc. Interested companies are requested to identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.

The Government requests answers for the following:
1. How would your company plan to airlift these sanitized vehicles into the remote location of the range? 
2. How long would if take for your company to completely sanitize and have vehicles ready for placement, to include meeting environmental regulations?
3.  Please provide any inputs or recommendations for this requirement.

CONTACT INFORMATION Following is the Point of Contact (POC) for this RFI: Tammie Askew (808) 449-6860x609 or email tammie.askew@hickam.af.mil.  Please submit responses via e-mail in Microsoft Office format by 04 October 2004, to this point of contact at Hickam AFB.

<SUBJECT>54--Portomod Structure Covering
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Warehouse Equipment and Supply Company, Huntsville, AL.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center has a requirement to replace the existing fabric covering on building 4528, with a #8028 FRLT DC-6/Opaque DC-6 White, BW Tedlar architectural fabric cover. Warehouse originally designed, constructed, and installed the structure. A vendor other than Warehouse would need to generate engineering drawings and plans to design a fabric covering for the Portomod Structure building 4528.  It is estimated that 280 man-hours of engineering and design effort would be required to prepare the design for a replacement covering.  Award to a vendor other than Warehouse Equipment and Supply would therefore result in substantial duplication of cost that the Government is not expected to recover through an open competition. Therefore, due to time, compatibility, and related cost issues, no other vendor other than Warehouse Equipment and Supply Company meets the requirements.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. Award to a vendor other than Warehouse Equipment and Supply Company would result in the acquisition of substandard equipment that will not meet mission requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST September 27, 2004 will be considered by the Government.  POC:  Mathew Ridolfi, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be emailed  to Mathew Ridolfi at  Mathew.ridolfi@mms.gov.

<SUBJECT>--US Industry Day for the UK-US future joint program of research into a ground-based system for the detection and countering of land mines on military routes
<DESC>The Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (MoD) and the Department of Defense of the United States of America (DoD) are discussing a future joint program of research into a ground-based system for the detecti on and countering of land mines on military routes. The end objective of the future program is to jointly develop and then evaluate a demonstration system prototype.  The work will involve both MoD and DoD organizations plus industrial organizations in bot h the UK and US in a fully collaborative program that will pool and share all information produced. All work will be exploitable by either nation for future countermine and related work. The future program is expected to focus on countering buried and surf ace laid anti-vehicle land mines under the following conditions, (in priority order):  Real time medium range (5m to 100m) mine detection and recognition from a ground vehicle.  Real time short range (less than 5m) mine detection, recognition and identific ation from a ground vehicle.  Countering the threat at short range (less than 5m) from a ground vehicle.  The prototype system must provide a rate of advance broadly compatible with the tempo of military operations and be compatible with a medium weight fo rce. The prototype system must also offer the potential for enhancement to provide capability against a wider range of threats, more rapid rates of advance and other terrain.  In late 2004, both the US DoD and the UK MoD will host an industy day in both th e UK and the US to provide further details of the program.  Possible industrial and contracting arrangements will be discussed during the Industrial day. The US industry day will be conducted on 28 October 2004, 1300 hours at the Crystal City Hyatt in Arli ngton, Virginia.  The UK industry day will be conducted in the UK on 9 November 2004.  Individuals who plan to attend the US industry day meeting should provide the their name and company information (to include company name, street address, email address and phone number) to the US Army Contracting Officer, Peggy A. Melanson, email: peggy.melanson@cacw.army.mil by 22 October 2004.  Questions about the US industry day should be forwarded by email to the Ms. Melanson.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The solicitation number for the announcement is NICHD 2004-06 and this announcement is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  This announcement and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-23.
 
This requirement is a total small business set-aside and the associated NAICS code is 541690 and small business size standard is $6.0 million. 

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a requirement for Systematic Literature Summaries, Assessments, Syntheses and Meta-Analyses. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) of 2002 directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and in consultation with the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and experts in pediatric research, to develop and prioritize a list of drugs for which pediatric clinical studies are needed.  

The BPCA requires the NIH to develop, prioritize and publish in the Federal Register an annual list of approved drugs for which:

1.	There is an approved Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). 
2.	There is a submitted ANDA that could receive FDA approval. 
3.	There is no patent protection or market exclusivity for an existing New Drug Application (NDA.) 
4.	There is referral for inclusion on the list regardless of market protection.

The BPCA legislation states:

CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION- In developing and prioritizing the list under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider, for each drug on the list--
(A) 	the availability of information concerning the safe and effective use of the drug in the pediatric population;
(B) 	whether additional information is needed;
(C) 	whether new pediatric studies concerning the drug may produce health benefits in the pediatric population; and
(D) 	whether reformulation of the drug is necessary.

 In addition, the BPCA legislative language identifies the group of drugs eligible for consideration, essentially off-patent medications, for which “additional studies are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the use of the drug in the pediatric population”.  

Annual lists were published in the Federal Register in January 2003 and February 2004, with a mid-cycle list published in August 2003.

The Government has a requirement for the expertise and resources necessary to conduct assessments of the available literature, and systematic reviews of the literature on scientific questions related to implementation of BPCA.  The reviews shall center primarily on prescription medications used by the pediatric populations, but may also include topics related to the conduct of clinical trials in pediatric populations, (e.g., a systematic review of the literature regarding consent processes in pediatric clinical trials.)  

The ontractor shall be required to analyze questions, as specified by the Government, which can be addressed by meta-analysis, and address areas where meta-analysis can be used to inform the labeling process.  This task shall be followed by further meta-analyses conducted to answer specific questions regarding pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), efficacy and safety of prescription drugs in pediatric populations.  

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a searchable database, updated on an annual basis, comprising the literature of case reports, case series, observational studies and clinical trials for off-patent drugs used by the pediatric population. 

BPCA requires NICHD to participate in FDA’s preparation of Written Requests by providing scientific input.  These Written Requests may potentially become future requirements for pediatric clinical studies.  An end result of this process may be to prepare INDs (FDA regulatory documents) leading to drug labeling changes.  

Each of these activities requires literature synthesis, and many shall require meta-analyses.  In infrequent situations, where outside experts state that sufficient data are available to lead directly to comments on labeling changes (without further study), NICHD shall require a complete meta-analysis of efficacy and/or safety data to produce quantitative estimates of efficacy and/or safety.  The Contractor shall maintain a central data base of documents pertaining to the literature, and simultaneously adapt the literature syntheses to the needs at each step of the BPCA process.  This shall require a high level scientific input in design, conduct, and interpretation of each literature search and its products: systematic literature reviews and/or meta-analyses.

There may be instances when systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses are needed to address methodological questions regarding the conduct of pediatric clinical trials, for instance, to summarize approaches to randomization, the consent process, or other questions of study design.

In order to assess the availability of information about individual off-patent drugs, the Government has a requirement for state-of-the art systematic reviews of the literature.  In order to develop and prioritize the annual list, the Government will specify to the Contractor the drugs under consideration. The reviews shall be systematic, follow a validated methodology for search and synthesis, provide documentation, and produce literature syntheses that address the needs for further study.  
From an annual list of approximately 200 off-patent drugs as published in the Federal Register, the Government will identify a group (estimated not-to exceed 35) of drugs requiring initial assessments of the literature. The Government anticipates selecting 12 each year as prioritized for further study.  .  

The Government requires continual expansion and updating of literature reviews throughout the process of developing Written Requests, preparing solicitations, developing clinical trials and submitting data for regulatory labeling.  Smaller groups of drugs will require more extensive literature reviews and meta-analyses, as described below.  

The Contractor shall perform the following services from the annual list: 

1)	Initial assessment of literature - 35 drugs/year. 
The Contractor shall perform a comprehensive assessment of the literature using a standardized search methodology, and documenting the search methodology.  The work shall include all information about the drug in neonates and children under the age of 18.  The assessment of the literature shall include a quantitative enumeration of the total number of references regarding the drug, as well as sub-totals for the following categories:  case-reports and case series, observational studies, and clinical trials.  A separate enumeration will be made by content of the references for the following sub-categories:  PK/PD data, pharmacoepidemiology (patterns of use), efficacy, and safety.  Pharmacoepidemiology shall include:  indications for using the drug in pediatric populations, inpatient and outpatient frequency of use, age, sex and race/ethnicity patterns of use.  The contractor shall develop a summary format to assess the quality and availability of data regarding PK/PD, efficacy and safety for each drug, and to identify research questions requiring further study for scientific of regulatory (labeling) purposes.
2)	Systematic literature review - 24 drugs as specified by the Government. 
The Contractor shall conduct a systematic review of the literature, involving abstraction/extraction of data in the articles identified in item 1, and summarizing findings in tables and text.  These syntheses shall be used to inform detailed discussion of drugs under consideration to be included in the priority list published each January.

The Naval Reserve Center has a requirement for repairing the hulls on two vessels which has already been previously advertised on N42082-04-Q-0151 for sandblasting and painting, which that resulted in finding that the vessels are not seaworthy and that hulls were needed to be repaired so that the vessels can be seaworthiness. Davis Boat Works, 99 Jefferson Ave., Newport News VA 23607 was awarded that contract.  This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services shall satisfy the agency’s requirement. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

This procurement is set aside 100% for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238330, and the small business size standard is $12M.  The Government intends to issue a firm fixed price purchase contract(s) for the following: 


STATEMENT OF WORK #1 IS AS FOLLOWS:

Statement of Work OFH Basketball Courts


Service:  Install (4) new basketball court surfaces over the top of already existing floors. Also includes painting court lines and fixing volleyball shelves and face plates. 

Job Site:  Offutt Field Houses bldg 321 Offutt AFB NE 68113

Pre-renovation procedures – 
The courts are ready and no real requirements exist or need to occur prior to start of project other than relocation of basketballs and bleachers.  OFH staff will ensure this occurs prior to state of work.

Scope of Work:  replace playing court surfaces on (4) basketball courts at OFH.  The new floor surfaces can be installed over the existing area.  The floors should have a concrete base (which already exists).  The courts should be covered with a sleeper system and a hardwood surface.  Maple tongue and groove and pressure treated beech are the recommended requirements for playing court surface.  Courts must adhere and meet DIN standards (Deutsches Intitut fur Normung).  These standards require that a floor meet six criteria:
1.	Shock absorption-a floor’s ability to reduce the impact of contact with the floor surface.  The greater the shock absorption, the more protective it is because it reduces impact forces.  
2.	Standard vertical deformation – the actual vertical deflection of the floor upon impact.  The greater the deformation, the more the floor deflects downward.  Floors with minimal deformation are not good at absorbing impact forces.
3.	Deflective indention- the actual vertical deflection of the floor at a distance 50 cm from the point of impact.  The greater the indentation, the more likely impact at one spot will cause deflection at a distant point.
4.	Sliding characterists- the surface friction of the finished floor. A floor with poor sliding characteristics would be inappropriate for aerobics or basketball.
5.	Ball reflection – (game action response) the response of a ball dropped on the floor compared to a ball dropped on the concrete.
6.	Rolling Load – a floor’s ability to withstand heavy weight without breaking or sustaining permanent damage. 
The DIN criteria are then used to evaluate the effectiveness of a floor.  A floor will have one of three functions:
1.	Sports function – a floor that serves a sports function enhances athletic performance.  Surface friction and ball reflection are important here.
2.	Protective function – a floor that serves a protective function reduces the risk of injury (e.g. from a fall) during activity.  Shock absorption is important here.
3.	Material technical function – a floor that serves a material – technical function meets the sports and protective functions.

In a health/fitness facility, the gymnasium and multipurpose floors are classified under sports function or material technical function.  The aerobics floor is classified under the protective function, with some sports function characteristics.

A floor surface that has a material technical function should meet the following DIN criteria:
Shock absorption			53% minimum
Standard vertical deformation 	2.3 mm minimum
Deflective indentation			15% maximum
Sliding characteristics			0.5 to 0.7 range
Ball deflection				90% minimum
Rolling load				337.6 lb

Court dimensions: 94 ft x 50 ft, with a 10 ft unobstructed space on all sides (3 ft minimum).  The color of the lane space marks and neutral zone should contrast with the color of the bounding lines.  The mid court marks should be the same color as the bounding lines.  All lines should be 2-in wide (neutral zone excluded).  All dimensions are to inside edge of lines except where noted.  

Volleyball court markings:  recommended size of a volleyball court is 30 ft x 60 ft with a 10 ft unobstructed area on all sides (6 ft minimum). All measurements for court markings are to the outside of the lines except for the centerline. All court markings to be 2 – in wide, except as noted.  Net height at center should be as follows: men’s 8 ft 0 inches, women 7 ft 4 inches.  

2 courts are to only have basketball markings, 1 court should have both basketball and 2 side by side volleyball markings as well as shelves and face plates to cover openings in floor, 1 court is to only have side by side volleyball court markings, shelves and face plates.

All courts should have two (2) coats of seal and two (2) coats finish. 

Courts will be located slightly above ground and will not be flush with existing elevation it will require a transition ramp/grade/slope from new surface level to existing level.  At one end of each court must provide wheelchair access and ramp.

Contractor will be required to clean up all fine dust and materials involved in development and construction of courts.

STATEMENT OF WORK #2 IS AS FOLLOWS:

Statement of Work (2) for Aerobic rooms OFH & Frady Fitness Center

Service: Remove existing carpeting and padding from each aerobic room at OFH and Frady Fitness Center and replace with new sprung flooring.

Job Site:  Offutt Field House, bldg 321 and Frady Fitness Center, bldg 305 Offutt AFB NE 68113

Pre-renovation Procedures – Fitness Staff will remove all supplies and equipment from each area so work space has ease of access and is free of equipment and materials.

Scope of work:
Contractor must remove all existing carpet, cove base and sub base materials from both facilities. 

Existing door will need to be cut and raised as well as wall coverings due to the addition of new flooring. Contractor will ensure there is a smooth transition in and out of rooms to existing hallway floors.  Will need to ensure all fire codes are meet and adhered too. 

All existing carpet, padding and other waste materials need to be removed from facility and placed in dumpster.  Contractor will ensure area is clean and free of debris, dirt and materials upon completion of work.  

The floor must consist of a hardwood sprung floor which meets the criteria outlined below in DIN standards.  Please note the reference made under protective function which is the requirement for aerobic floor systems.  

Floor must have two (2) coats of seal and two (2) coats of finish. 

Contractor will be responsible for replacing cove base in both rooms as well.


The courts should be covered with a sleeper system and a hardwood surface.  Maple tongue and groove and pressure treated beech are the recommended requirements for playing court surface.  Courts must adhere and meet DIN standards (Deutsches Intitut fur Normung).  These standards require that a floor meet six criteria:
1.	Shock absorption-a floor’s ability to reduce the impact of contact with the floor surface.  The greater the shock absorption, the more protective it is because it reduces impact forces.  An aerobics floor, for example, would need more shock absorption than a basketball court. 
2.	Standard vertical deformation – the actual vertical deflection of the floor upon impact.  The greater the deformation, the more the floor deflects downward.  Floors with minimal deformation are not good at absorbing impact forces.
3.	Deflective indention- the actual vertical deflection of the floor at a distance 50 cm from the point of impact.  The greater the indentation, the more likely impact at one spot will cause deflection at a distant point.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations document (FAR) subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number FA4600-04-T-0207 is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-18. All applicable provision and clauses are included in the actual solicitation.  This electronic announcement constitutes the only solicitation being issued.  This procurement is set aside 100% for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238330, and the small business size standard is $12M.  The Government intends to issue a firm fixed price purchase contract(s) for the following: 


STATEMENT OF WORK #1 IS AS FOLLOWS:

Statement of Work OFH Basketball Courts


Service:  Install (4) new basketball court surfaces over the top of already existing floors. Also includes painting court lines and fixing volleyball shelves and face plates. 

Job Site:  Offutt Field Houses bldg 321 Offutt AFB NE 68113

Pre-renovation procedures – 
The courts are ready and no real requirements exist or need to occur prior to start of project other than relocation of basketballs and bleachers.  OFH staff will ensure this occurs prior to state of work.

Scope of Work:  replace playing court surfaces on (4) basketball courts at OFH.  The new floor surfaces can be installed over the existing area.  The floors should have a concrete base (which already exists).  The courts should be covered with a sleeper system and a hardwood surface.  Maple tongue and groove and pressure treated beech are the recommended requirements for playing court surface.  Courts must adhere and meet DIN standards (Deutsches Intitut fur Normung).  These standards require that a floor meet six criteria:
1.	Shock absorption-a floor’s ability to reduce the impact of contact with the floor surface.  The greater the shock absorption, the more protective it is because it reduces impact forces.  
2.	Standard vertical deformation – the actual vertical deflection of the floor upon impact.  The greater the deformation, the more the floor deflects downward.  Floors with minimal deformation are not good at absorbing impact forces.
3.	Deflective indention- the actual vertical deflection of the floor at a distance 50 cm from the point of impact.  The greater the indentation, the more likely impact at one spot will cause deflection at a distant point.
4.	Sliding characterists- the surface friction of the finished floor. A floor with poor sliding characteristics would be inappropriate for aerobics or basketball.
5.	Ball reflection – (game action response) the response of a ball dropped on the floor compared to a ball dropped on the concrete.
6.	Rolling Load – a floor’s ability to withstand heavy weight without breaking or sustaining permanent damage. 
The DIN criteria are then used to evaluate the effectiveness of a floor.  A floor will have one of three functions:
1.	Sports function – a floor that serves a sports function enhances athletic performance.  Surface friction and ball reflection are important here.
2.	Protective function – a floor that serves a protective function reduces the risk of injury (e.g. from a fall) during activity.  Shock absorption is important here.
3.	Material technical function – a floor that serves a material – technical function meets the sports and protective functions.

In a health/fitness facility, the gymnasium and multipurpose floors are classified under sports function or material technical function.  The aerobics floor is classified under the protective function, with some sports function characteristics.

A floor surface that has a material technical function should meet the following DIN criteria:
Shock absorption			53% minimum
Standard vertical deformation 	2.3 mm minimum
Deflective indentation			15% maximum
Sliding characteristics			0.5 to 0.7 range
Ball deflection				90% minimum
Rolling load				337.6 lb

Court dimensions: 94 ft x 50 ft, with a 10 ft unobstructed space on all sides (3 ft minimum).  The color of the lane space marks and neutral zone should contrast with the color of the bounding lines.  The mid court marks should be the same color as the bounding lines.  All lines should be 2-in wide (neutral zone excluded).  All dimensions are to inside edge of lines except where noted.  

Volleyball court markings:  recommended size of a volleyball court is 30 ft x 60 ft with a 10 ft unobstructed area on all sides (6 ft minimum). All measurements for court markings are to the outside of the lines except for the centerline. All court markings to be 2 – in wide, except as noted.  Net height at center should be as follows: men’s 8 ft 0 inches, women 7 ft 4 inches.  

2 courts are to only have basketball markings, 1 court should have both basketball and 2 side by side volleyball markings as well as shelves and face plates to cover openings in floor, 1 court is to only have side by side volleyball court markings, shelves and face plates.

All courts should have two (2) coats of seal and two (2) coats finish. 

Courts will be located slightly above ground and will not be flush with existing elevation it will require a transition ramp/grade/slope from new surface level to existing level.  At one end of each court must provide wheelchair access and ramp.

Contractor will be required to clean up all fine dust and materials involved in development and construction of courts.

STATEMENT OF WORK #2 IS AS FOLLOWS:

Statement of Work (2) for Aerobic rooms OFH & Frady Fitness Center

Service: Remove existing carpeting and padding from each aerobic room at OFH and Frady Fitness Center and replace with new sprung flooring.

Job Site:  Offutt Field House, bldg 321 and Frady Fitness Center, bldg 305 Offutt AFB NE 68113

Pre-renovation Procedures – Fitness Staff will remove all supplies and equipment from each area so work space has ease of access and is free of equipment and materials.

Scope of work:
Contractor must remove all existing carpet, cove base and sub base materials from both facilities. 

Existing door will need to be cut and raised as well as wall coverings due to the addition of new flooring. Contractor will ensure there is a smooth transition in and out of rooms to existing hallway floors.  Will need to ensure all fire codes are meet and adhered too. 

All existing carpet, padding and other waste materials need to be removed from facility and placed in dumpster.  Contractor will ensure area is clean and free of debris, dirt and materials upon completion of work.  

The floor must consist of a hardwood sprung floor which meets the criteria outlined below in DIN standards.  Please note the reference made under protective function which is the requirement for aerobic floor systems.  

Floor must have two (2) coats of seal and two (2) coats of finish. 

Contractor will be responsible for replacing cove base in both rooms as well.


The courts should be covered with a sleeper system and a hardwood surface.  Maple tongue and groove and pressure treated beech are the recommended requirements for playing court surface.  Courts must adhere and meet DIN standards (Deutsches Intitut fur Normung).  These standards require that a floor meet six criteria:
1.	Shock absorption-a floor’s ability to reduce the impact of contact with the floor surface.  The greater the shock absorption, the more protective it is because it reduces impact forces.  An aerobics floor, for example, would need more shock absorption than a basketball court. 
2.	Standard vertical deformation – the actual vertical deflection of the floor upon impact.  The greater the deformation, the more the floor deflects downward.  Floors with minimal deformation are not good at absorbing impact forces.
3.	Deflective indention- the actual vertical deflection of the floor at a distance 50 cm from the point of impact.  The greater the indentation, the more likely impact at one spot will cause deflection at a distant point.
4.	Sliding characteristics- the surface friction of the finished floor. A floor with poor sliding characteristics would be inappropriate for aerobics or basketball.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The solicitation number for the announcement is NICHD 2004-06 and this announcement is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  This announcement and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-23.
 
This requirement is a total small business set-aside and the associated NAICS code is 541690 and small business size standard is $6.0 million. 

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a requirement for Systematic Literature Summaries, Assessments, Syntheses and Meta-Analyses. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) of 2002 directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and in consultation with the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and experts in pediatric research, to develop and prioritize a list of drugs for which pediatric clinical studies are needed.  

The BPCA requires the NIH to develop, prioritize and publish in the Federal Register an annual list of approved drugs for which:

1.	There is an approved Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). 
2.	There is a submitted ANDA that could receive FDA approval. 
3.	There is no patent protection or market exclusivity for an existing New Drug Application (NDA.) 
4.	There is referral for inclusion on the list regardless of market protection.

The BPCA legislation states:

CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION- In developing and prioritizing the list under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider, for each drug on the list--
(A) 	the availability of information concerning the safe and effective use of the drug in the pediatric population;
(B) 	whether additional information is needed;
(C) 	whether new pediatric studies concerning the drug may produce health benefits in the pediatric population; and
(D) 	whether reformulation of the drug is necessary.

 In addition, the BPCA legislative language identifies the group of drugs eligible for consideration, essentially off-patent medications, for which “additional studies are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the use of the drug in the pediatric population”.  

Annual lists were published in the Federal Register in January 2003 and February 2004, with a mid-cycle list published in August 2003.

The Government has a requirement for the expertise and resources necessary to conduct assessments of the available literature, and systematic reviews of the literature on scientific questions related to implementation of BPCA.  The reviews shall center primarily on prescription medications used by the pediatric populations, but may also include topics related to the conduct of clinical trials in pediatric populations, (e.g., a systematic review of the literature regarding consent processes in pediatric clinical trials.)  

The ontractor shall be required to analyze questions, as specified by the Government, which can be addressed by meta-analysis, and address areas where meta-analysis can be used to inform the labeling process.  This task shall be followed by further meta-analyses conducted to answer specific questions regarding pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), efficacy and safety of prescription drugs in pediatric populations.  

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a searchable database, updated on an annual basis, comprising the literature of case reports, case series, observational studies and clinical trials for off-patent drugs used by the pediatric population. 

BPCA requires NICHD to participate in FDA’s preparation of Written Requests by providing scientific input.  These Written Requests may potentially become future requirements for pediatric clinical studies.  An end result of this process may be to prepare INDs (FDA regulatory documents) leading to drug labeling changes.  

Each of these activities requires literature synthesis, and many shall require meta-analyses.  In infrequent situations, where outside experts state that sufficient data are available to lead directly to comments on labeling changes (without further study), NICHD shall require a complete meta-analysis of efficacy and/or safety data to produce quantitative estimates of efficacy and/or safety.  The Contractor shall maintain a central data base of documents pertaining to the literature, and simultaneously adapt the literature syntheses to the needs at each step of the BPCA process.  This shall require a high level scientific input in design, conduct, and interpretation of each literature search and its products: systematic literature reviews and/or meta-analyses.

There may be instances when systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses are needed to address methodological questions regarding the conduct of pediatric clinical trials, for instance, to summarize approaches to randomization, the consent process, or other questions of study design.

In order to assess the availability of information about individual off-patent drugs, the Government has a requirement for state-of-the art systematic reviews of the literature.  In order to develop and prioritize the annual list, the Government will specify to the Contractor the drugs under consideration. The reviews shall be systematic, follow a validated methodology for search and synthesis, provide documentation, and produce literature syntheses that address the needs for further study.  
From an annual list of approximately 200 off-patent drugs as published in the Federal Register, the Government will identify a group (estimated not-to exceed 35) of drugs requiring initial assessments of the literature. The Government anticipates selecting 12 each year as prioritized for further study.  .  

The Government requires continual expansion and updating of literature reviews throughout the process of developing Written Requests, preparing solicitations, developing clinical trials and submitting data for regulatory labeling.  Smaller groups of drugs will require more extensive literature reviews and meta-analyses, as described below.  

The Contractor shall perform the following services from the annual list: 

1)	Initial assessment of literature - 35 drugs/year. 
The Contractor shall perform a comprehensive assessment of the literature using a standardized search methodology, and documenting the search methodology.  The work shall include all information about the drug in neonates and children under the age of 18.  The assessment of the literature shall include a quantitative enumeration of the total number of references regarding the drug, as well as sub-totals for the following categories:  case-reports and case series, observational studies, and clinical trials.  A separate enumeration will be made by content of the references for the following sub-categories:  PK/PD data, pharmacoepidemiology (patterns of use), efficacy, and safety.  Pharmacoepidemiology shall include:  indications for using the drug in pediatric populations, inpatient and outpatient frequency of use, age, sex and race/ethnicity patterns of use.  The contractor shall develop a summary format to assess the quality and availability of data regarding PK/PD, efficacy and safety for each drug, and to identify research questions requiring further study for scientific of regulatory (labeling) purposes.
2)	Systematic literature review - 24 drugs as specified by the Government. 
The Contractor shall conduct a systematic review of the literature, involving abstraction/extraction of data in the articles identified in item 1, and summarizing findings in tables and text.  These syntheses shall be used to inform detailed discussion of drugs under consideration to be included in the priority list published each January.  The syntheses shall be circulated to expert consultants (Government and non-Government) to assist them in formulating recommendations for prioritization.
3)	Expanded literature review as background for Written Request process - 12 drugs as specified by the Government. 
The Contractor shall expand the systematic reviews prepared under item 2 and provide a literature synthesis to be used as background for NICHD scientists working with FDA to prepare the Written Request for a specified drug.   The emphasis of the literature synthesis shall be to provide information regarding research needs, and information needed in designing a study such as estimates of effect, estimates of adverse events, and measurement of outcomes.
4)	Expanded literature review as background for Project Officer - 12 drugs as specified by the Government
The Contractor shall expand on the systematic reviews prepared under item 3 and prepare a literature synthesis to be used as background for NICHD Project Officers preparing future requirements which may become pediatric clinical studies.
5)	Literature synthesis for regulatory requirements (IND process) - 6 drugs/indication combinations as specified by the Government 
The Contractor  shall expand on the systematic reviews prepared under item 4 to provide a finished document that may be submitted by NICHD to FDA as part of the IND process.
6)	Meta-analyses - 3 drug/indication combinations as specified by the Government 
The Contractor shall conduct meta-analyses of specific questions regarding PK/PD, efficacy and/or safety.  These meta-analyses shall be provided to scientific experts to determine the feasibility and best course of action for initiating a label change based on the published data and the meta-analysis.  The meta-analyses need to be comparable in quality to those published in the best peer reviewed journals. The Government anticipates the publication of the meta-analysis in peer-reviewed journals.
7)	Meta-analysis – 1 methodologic issue in pediatric clinical trials as specified by the Government.
The Contractor shall conduct a meta-analysis of methodologic issues in pediatric clinical trials.
8)	The Contractor shall develop and maintain a searchable data base that accumulates information abstracted/extracted during the period of performance of the contract, 
9)	The Contractor  shall document all methodologies and provide documentation to NICHD in electronic form. 

It is anticipated that this requirement shall be for a base year and up to an additional four one-year option period(s.)  Offerors are instructed to include in their proposal, their prices for the base year and up to an additional four one-year option period(s.) 

The NICHD has an annual requirement for: Initial assessment of literature - 35 drugs/year; Systematic literature review - 24 drugs as specified by the Government; Expanded literature review as background for Written Request process - 12 drugs as specified by the Government; Expanded literature review as background for Project Officer - 12 drugs as specified by the Government; Literature synthesis for regulatory requirements (IND process) - 6 drugs/indication combinations as specified by the Government; and Meta-analysis – 1 methodologic issue in pediatric clinical trials as specified by the Government.

<DESC>This amendment consists of two elements.  The first element answers questions that have arisen concerning some of the requirements of this acquisition.  The second element involves modifications to the specifications.  A. Is the supplier responsible for the installation and integration/testing of the listed equipment?  Response -  The supplier is not responsible for installation of the listed equipment.  The supplier is responsible for assuring that all of the instrumentation is integrated into the data acquisition and telemetry (i.e., we need to be sure that all of the instruments talk correctly).  We expect that all instrumentation delivered will be functional.  B. There is a reference to a mounting bracket for the ADCPs.  What does the bracket mount the ADCP to?  Does the end user have the rest of the installation platform that goes into the water or does this need to be designed?   If design is required, detailed information on the shoreline conditions will be needed.  Response - We are looking for a "standard" mounting bracket (i.e. from the factory).  If this doesn't exist then please state it in the quotation.  C. Can you provide detailed information for the installation sites for the sondes and ADCPs - coordinates, site conditions, etc?  Response - The site selection has not been finalized.  We are primarily interested in gathering the equipment/instrumentation now.  Any equipment/supplies that is generic to any siting requirement (eg. guy wires for a met tower) should be included.  Any equipment/supplies that are dependent on site specific requirements should not be included.  D.  What is the distance from the installation sites to the USHRL?  Are there any restrictions on the types of radios used for the telemetry of the data?  Response - The distance from the installation sites to the USHRL is approximately 80 miles (direct line).  We know of no restrictions on the types of radios, although there may be statutes from the State of Florida concerning this.
