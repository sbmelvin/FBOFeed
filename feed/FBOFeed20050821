<SUBJECT>66 -- Notice of Intent to Procure Four FTIR Systems from Midac Corporation
<DESC>The Acquisition Management Division (AMD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the Materials and Construction Research Division (MCRD), Polymeric Materials Group (PMG) in the NIST Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL), requires four (4) Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers with a custom optical interface.  The custom optical interface will allow the optical path to analyze samples away from the FTIR.  This will allow the samples to be handled automatically by a custom sampling system.

Purpose: These spectrometers are an integral part of a planned Automated High Throughput Measurement system.  The system will consist of an articulated robot and multiple analytical instruments.  The initial instrument configuration will consist of (4) Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers, (2) UV-Vis Spectrometers, and (1) NIST developed Glossmeter.  Since the system is expandable, additional instruments can be added at a later date.  The articulated robot is the “controller” that identifies the sample, retrieves it from a sample rack, inserts it into the proper instrument and then retrieves it when the analysis is finished.  Due to long purge times and the high number of scans necessary for high quality FTIR spectra, the limiting step is the collection of FTIR spectra.  Multiple FTIR spectrometers, running in parallel, will decrease the measurement time for a set of samples by a factor equal to the number of spectrometers.  This system supports items (2) and (3) in our group mission statement (see above).

For the Automated High Throughput Measurement system, PMG requires a compact, rugged, research grade FTIR spectrometer.  Compact size and minimizing the length of time for purging are the two primary issues that must be addressed without sacrificing the quality of the IR spectra.

Compact size:  PMG currently has 2 research grade FTIR spectrometers.  In the past, PMG has attempted to use these for small-scale versions of this application, with negative results.  These instruments have too large of a footprint and it is difficult or impossible to configure the sampling external to the instrument.  Since PMG needs to be able to maximize the number of instruments on the Automated High Throughput Measurement system, instrument size is the most critical specification.  Smaller instrumentation is also easier to reposition, allowing a configuration similar to computer “plug and play” components to be adopted.  

Purge time:  In FTIR spectroscopy, atmospheric water contributes to degraded spectra.  All FTIR spectrometers are either dessicated or purged with dry air.  In the conceptual configuration, the entire beam path is purged, except for the small area near the sample.  This will enable spectra to be taken immediately without purging of the spectrometer, the small area near the sample will be subtracted from the final spectra.  In PMG’s current application, for each set of samples, the FTIR is purged for 15 minutes.  Since a set of spectra is collected in 30 minutes, this alone will increase sample throughput by 50%.  A more compact instrument will also decrease the purge time.

The Government’s minimum specifications for the FTIR spectrometers are:

1.  FTIR Spectrometer
a.  Interferometer
i.  ZnSe with Germanium coating
ii.  90 degree Michelson design
(1) moving mirror hinged on frictionless mechanical bearings
(2) vibration and shock resistant construction
(3) not susceptible to resonant frequencies.
(4) Ability to operate in any plane
iii.  User selectable resolution, 0.5cm-1 to 32cm-1
iv.  Accuracy: greater than 0.01 cm-1

b.  Beamsplitter
i.  ZnSe with Ge coating

c.  Source
i.  1650 K 
ii.  Air cooled
iii.  Permanently aligned

d.  Detector
i.  MCT (Mercury Cadmium Telluride)
ii.  Range: 2 to 18.5 microns, 5000 to 540 cm-1

e.  Optics
i.  ZnSe (Zinc Selenide) windows for resistance to moisture damage.
ii.  All interface optics gold coated
iii.  Separate input output ports with collimated beams for external accessories mounted with flanges

f.  Case
i.  Hermetically sealed
ii.  Maximum dimensions: 8 x 14 x 8 inches, 20.4 x 35.6 x 20.4 cm (W x D x H)  

g.  Electronics
i.  Dual ADC

2.  Custom Optical Interface
a.  External optical transfer optics designed to provide focused beam for NIST horizontal sample wheel.
b.  Must allow easy access to sample holder for removal/replacement by robotic system
c.  Optical path must be sealed and/or purged, except at sample site

d.  Conceptual drawing available upon request.

e.  Possible configuration
i.  Optical conduits (Light guides)

3.  Software
a.  Must to be able to operate the instrument for:
i.  Data collection
ii.  Archiving
iii.  Analysis
iv.  Real-time display
v.  Operating system: Windows XP Professional
vi.  Automated, unattended operation of the spectrometer with multi-level alarm thresholds that can automatically activate digital or analog alarm devices.
vii.  Capability to output to any PLC or DLC system using serial, TCP/IP, or 4-20 ma outputs.
viii.  System can be externally controlled to start and stop from a remote source via RS-432 or Socket interface.

Based on NIST’s market research, which included a formal sources sought notice posted in FedBizOpps (see http://www2.eps.gov/servlet/Solicitation/R/DOC/NIST/AcAsD/Reference-Number-05-861-6594-Sources-Sought-Notice), NIST has identified only one system, manufactured by Midac Corporation, that is capable of meeting or exceeding all of the above specifications.  Therefore, the NIST AMD intends to negotiate an open market purchase order on a sole source basis, under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, with Midac Corporation to purchase four (4) FTIR Spectrometers that meet or exceed those specifications.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, parties that are expressly authorized by Midac Corporation to sell the components noted above may respond to this notice and provide evidence that they are authorized to sell it and shall provide written evidence of such authorization.  Such evidence shall be provided to Joseph.Widdup@nist.gov no later than August 29, 2005; if it cannot be emailed, it may be faxed to Joseph Widdup at fax (301) 975-8884.  The Government will then determine whether the procurement for the system noted above could be competed.  A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition will be based solely upon responses to this notice.

<SUBJECT>Q -- North East Medical MATO
<DESC>The U.S. Navy’s Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to establish, on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, three bridge Multiple Award Task Order (MATO) contracts with the three current MATO contractors who were awarded MATO contracts in fiscal year 2000.  These MATO contractors currently provide Healthcare Worker services for the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD and its associated sites:  Naval Health Clinic, Patuxent River, MD; Naval Health Clinic, Quantico, VA; and  Naval Health Clinic, Annapolis, MD.   

The current MATO contracts that require bridge services are as follows:  N62645-01-D-5005 (Cherokee Medical Services, LLC. (Cherokee Medical)), N62645-01-D-5006 (Professional Healthcare, Inc. (Professional Healthcare)) and N62645-01-D-5007 and (Arora Group, Inc.).  The current contracts expire on 30 September 2005.  The proposed bridge contracts’ Period of Performance will be from 1 Oct 05 to 31 Jan 06.

The four-month Bridge Contracts will continue to provide the minimum services that are currently being provided for the agencies identified above.  In addition to the minimum quantities stated above, maximum quantities will be added to the bridge contracts that will allow for the potential need of increased services.  These maximum quantities will be mirrored on the three bridge awards to provide for competition between the three contractors for these services.

The bridge contracts shall be placed in anticipation of the award of Medical Multiple Agency Task Order (MATO) contracts resulting from competitive Solicitation, N62645-05-R-0009, for the Northeast Medical MATO contracts, anticipated to be awarded in late November 2005.  The anticipated performance start date for the competitive MATO contracting effort is 1 January 2006.  The National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD and its associated sites:  Naval Health Clinic, Patuxent River, MD, Naval Health Clinic, Quantico, VA, and  Naval Health Clinic, Annapolis, MD. are charged with the mission of providing medical health care for upwards of 500,000 active duty military personnel and their dependents, retired military personnel and their dependents, and other authorized personnel.  This mission has a direct effect on the war fighting capability of the United States Navy.  In order to meet this mission requirement, the bridge contracts, with the performance period of 1 Oct 05 through 31 January 2006, must be in place NLT 15 Sept 2005 so as to avoid a lapse in services.  A lapse in service would have an immediate and detrimental effect on the ability of the Navy to man deployed vessels and to fulfill the Navy’s DOD Operations Plans obligations to provide personnel in forward areas for war fighting, peacekeeping and/or humanitarian efforts.

<SUBJECT>66--Research Laser and supportive equipment
<DESC>Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, VA Rehabilitation R&D Center of Excellence in Advanced Platform Technology (The Cleveland APT Center) Cleveland, Ohio, intends to sole source this contract to National RP Support, Inc., to furnish an Xcyte CY-SM60 60mW Laser System for SLA-250 machine, which includes installation, an 18 month unlimited hour warranty. Also, a Half vat for SLA-250/40 with lid. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NAICS 811219 applies to this procurement. The Research department has the need for a new solid-state laser that will allow them to produce parts with significantly finer detail and at much higher resolution than their current HeCd laser. The current laser cannot be modified. The laser spot size controls the line width drawn on the resin surface and therefore limits the resolution of the smallest feature that can be produced on the machine. The mechanical properties of the parts produced using the SLA process are controlled by a combination of resin and laser properties. SLA resins are laser specific and resin producing companies have concentrated on developing a wide range of resins covering both strength and stiffness properties for the solid state laser systems. The current laser system is old technology and the range of compatible resins currently available is significantly limited, thereby significantly restricting the Research departments’ ability to match the mechanical properties of the prototype to the part design specifications. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs, 10000 Brecksville Road, Brecksville, Ohio 44141 or via fax to (440) 838-6052. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs will proceed with the sole source Xcyte Laser System and supportive equipment with National RP Support, Inc.
