Box 1500, Huntsvil le, AL 35807-3801. Background:  As part of the Executive Services and Communications Directorate (ESCD), the Directives and Records Divisions (D&RD) mission is to implement the Records Management Program for the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); manage the Departmen t of Defense (DOD) Directives System and other issuances; manage the DOD Federal Register System, Privacy Act, and Historical Research Programs; and implement and administer the Automatic/Systematic and Mandatory Declassification Review Programs for OSD an d components of the DOD.  Structured to execute these responsibilities, the D&RD is comprised of the Directives and Records Branch (D&RB) and Declassification and Historical Research Branch (D&HRB).  D&RDs mission and functions are vital elements supporti ng the DOD and implementing laws and governances.  Additionally, D&RD provides operational support for records management, document control, and has responsibilities for the planning, training, and execution of continuity of operations for ESCD.  To meet i ts mandate, D&RDs focus is to keep pace with and benefit from the application of information technology.  The following programs are central to the execution of D&RDs mission. The Records Management Program provides oversight and assists the DOD components in the establishment and maintenance of a system for maintaining and protecting records.  This oversight extends to the retirement of records to a temporary records storage fa cility in accordance with the Records Disposition Schedule, and authorizes the transfer to the National Archives records of permanent historical value.  All media are covered under this program.  A major element of records management and in support of the Government-wide effort to create a paperless work environment, the DOD Records Management Program is establishing a total electronic records environment.  It will include the creation, storage, retirement, and tra nsfer to the National Archives all records of permanent historical value in electronic format.  This effort is prudent and in concert with the National Archives and Records Administration mandated Electronic Records Management (ERM) initiative.  The curren t records population pending review is over 60 million pages at the Washington National Records Center (WNRC) with an annual addition of 2.5 million pages.  The effort now is to establish an ERM system within the OSD and other DOD Components and to convert  existing OSD records to electronic media. The Directives System Program is responsible for issuing DOD policy and guidance on the implementation of various Public Laws, Executive Orders, and Federal Regulations as they pertain to DOD and its missions.  This program monitors the development, approv al, distribution, and updating of all issuances as well as conducting format quality control and editing.  All issuances are currently being processed and maintained electronically in SGML format.  Unclassified issuances are available to all Government Age ncies and the public via the Internet.  This programs requirement is to ensure that all current and new issuances are timely processed in electronic format. The Federal Register System Program is responsible for the submission to the Federal Register System all DOD rulemaking documents including Directives, Instructions, Publications, and their changes and notices.  These documents are then published in the Fe deral Register if they affect the general public or members of a class of persons outside the Government.  The focus of this effort is to ensure that all old and new publications required to be published in the Federal Register are done in electronic forma t. The Privacy Act Program is responsible for the timely publication of Privacy Act Notices in the Federal Register. The Automatic/Systematic Declassification Review Program is responsible for reviewing for possible declassification all classified permanent historical information.  The bedrock requirements and instructions for declassification are set forth in Executive Orders.  The focus of the Declassification Program is to (1) review for declassification documents (within both OSD and other agency records) currently located at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), College Park, MD, and Washington Nat ional Records Center, Suitland, MD; (2) scan all classified documents to permit electronic review; (3) record those documents that are not declassified for future review and reference; and (4) transfer declassified document images to various storage media for reference and use by researchers.  A secondary requirement is to review for declassification records residing at Presidential Libraries or other Government locations. The Mandatory Declassification Review Program is responsible for responding to requests from the public and other Government Agencies for the declassification and release of specific documents.  A final response is required within 1 year of receipt of the request.  Key to this program is to scan into electronic file all old and new cases for processing, tracking, and reference purposes; to conduct electronic (on-line) declassification review; and to transfer declassified documents to suitable storage media for use by researchers. Scope of Work:  The scope of this work encompasses all supplies and services necessary to support comprehensive Records Management, Directives Management, Federal Registry System, Automatic/Systematic Declassification Review, and Mandatory Declassification  Review Programs for D&RD.
