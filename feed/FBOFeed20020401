<DESC>NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center intends to award a sole-source contract extension to Space Mark Inc (SMI), Colorado Springs, Colorado, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); only one responsible source under Contract NAS10-12060.  NASA KSC intends to extend the existing contract for a period of six (6) months consisting of a one-month basic period and five one-month options, from July 01, 2002 through December 31, 2002, to allow the orderly award and transition of the follow-on contract (Expendable Launch Vehicle Integrated Support (ELVIS).   The current contractor provides Operations Support Services for NASA's Vandenberg Launch Site at Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA.  These services include payload processing support consisting of long-range planning, coordination, technical documentation, requirements processing and scheduling; operational support consisting of SCAPE requirements, with the USAF, servicing of spacecraft fueling equipment, transportation and offloading of spacecraft, and operation of telemetry, office automation, television and operational intercom systems; facility support consisting of operation, maintenance, management, and modification of assigned facilities, systems, and equipment; support services such as logistics administrative, security, inspection, procurement, and training services.  The Operations Support Services provide a wide range of support and are essential to support launch activities at the NASA Vandenberg Launch Site.  SMI has managed the current contract since December 1993, and has the infrastructure in place to continue to provide these services without any interruption, for the brief extension period.  They have the experience, management skills, and trained personnel to carry out the day-to-day operations and meet the required schedules.  Because of the time involved in procuring and phasing-in services from another contractor and because of the short-term nature of the contract extension, SMI is considered to be the only source capable of meeting NASA's needs without a disruption of services. This is not a formal solicitation.  This synopsis is not considered a request for proposals.  There is no solicitation document available.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time on April 19, 2002.  Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System Joint Program Office intends to solicit proposals for the production of the Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR).  The DAGR program will provide authorized DoD, Federal Civilian and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) users of GPS User Equipment (UE) a lightweight (less than 2 pounds), hand-held, dual frequency (L1/L2), Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based, Precise Positioning Service (PPS) receiver.  The DAGR will have a ten-year service life.  The DAGR will be an easy to use, highly reliable, multiple-use device that can accommodate, with minimal training, a wide range of user skill levels.  The DAGR will replace the Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR) and be interoperable with PLGR integrated platforms.  Fielding is anticipated to begin in 4QFY04 at a target unit price of $2,000 or less (including a 5-year warranty).  Similar to the PLGR, the DAGR will be maintained by the developer with field service limited to battery change-out and self-test.  The production contract will contain firm fixed price options for a maximum acquisition of 188,300 DAGRs and an array of associated accessories over a period not to exceed eight years.

The Government's strategy in the DAGR solicitation will be to employ a "two step" approach.  The first step contains two First Article (FA) production contractors selected as a result of a best value source selection.  The second step is down select to the full rate production contractor based on price and performance competition.  Results from the first phase of the Development Testing (DT1) will be used in the down select.

Proposals will be due 30 days after release of the solicitation (scheduled for 15 April 2002) and will include 15 technical samples of the offeror's proposed design.  The Technical Samples (TS) will be tested and the results will be used in an assessment of the offeror's proposal risk.

This is a best value source selection conducted in accordance with FAR 15.3 and Supplements.    The Government intends to award two contracts for the delivery of 250 DAGR First Article Test units each and will exercise production options for only one contractor based upon Government-witnessed contractor FA testing, Government FA testing and the call for improvement proposal.  The Government reserves the right to award only one contract, if, in the opinion of the SSA, it is in the best interest of the Government. 

For the DAGR production down select, the Government will conduct a Limited Call for Improvement (LCFI) from the FA production contractors only--after approximately one month of Government Developmental Testing (DT1).  The down select will be based predominantly on cost/price and some key performance criteria.  

Selected schedule milestones are as follows:  RFP release 15 April 02; Proposals (and tech samples) due 16 May 02; Dual FAT contract award on 23 September 2002; Down select in August 2003.

See note 26.  The production of the supplies listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation for manufacture.  No contract award will be made on the basis of offers or proposals received in response to this notice.  Potential bidders may request access through the GPS Bidder's Library by contacting John Pezan at john.pezan@losangeles.af.mil or telephone at (310) 363-3309.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) announces a program in the area of Dual Use Science and Technology (DUS&T).  This Broad Agency Announcement seeks projects to create and/or develop new products or process technologies, in most cases, on a 50/50 cost share basis.  The DUS&T Program requires that the proposed technology have both military relevance and potential benefit (cost, performance, or sustainability of defense systems) and sufficient potential commercial (non-defense) applications to support a viable production base.  The offeror must normally bear at least 50% of the cost of the effort and at least 50% of this cost share must be high quality (i.e., cash, labor, or consumable materials).  The projects must result in the development of a technology, not the application of a technology.  The proposer must be a for-profit company or have at least one for-profit firm on its team.  Due to limited funding, the Government reserves the right to limit awards under any topic, and only proposals considered to be of superior quality will be funded.  Please note that this is an announcement to declare AFRL's intent to competitively fund dual-use technology projects and that no other request for proposals, solicitation, or announcement of this opportunity will be made.  Small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions are encouraged to participate.  Teaming arrangements, especially with academia, are encouraged when the result is a technically stronger proposal.  Awards will be made using a class of nonprocurement instruments called Technology Investment Agreements (TIAs).  The TIA's are not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), but instead are governed by the DoD Grants and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).  The DODGARS and sample TIA modules may be found at http://www.afmc-pub.wpafb.af.mil/organizations/HQ-AFMC/PK/pkt/assistance.htm.

<DESC>This synopsis advertises a Commercial Item requirement for "turn-key" data routing and retrieval (DR&R) telecommunications services; hereafter, the Converged POES/DMSP Telecommunications Contract (CP/DT).  These services will be notionally comprised of discrete firm-fixed-price (FFP) point-to-point "circuit" unit prices.  The term "turn-key" is defined as comprising the satellite uplink (e.g., ground station facilities and associated electronics), the communications satellite (SATCOM) transponders, and the satellite downlink to users either directly or through a teleport facility, including all equipment necessary at the users' site. These DR&R services will support the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) data dissemination mission.  The NOAA is a bureau of the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC).  NOAA's mission for data dissemination hereunder includes but is not necessarily limited to data acquired from the Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) and the Department of Defense's Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) systems.   Optional circuits will include priced circuits for METEOSAT/GMS and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) GOES-9.  The NOAA contract will be managed by the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS)/Integrated Program Office (IPO), an office under the DOC/NOAA, National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Services (NESDIS).  Contract award is planned for July 8, 2002.  The effective date of operations will be no later than September 6, 2002.  Between award and the operational effective date the Contractor will be testing circuits and ensuring a transparent phase-over to this successor contract.  The POES and DMSP's telecommunication services are currently acquired through DISA/DITCO, Scott AFB, IL, Contract DCA200-96-C-0047.  The maximum term envisioned for this contract is 10 years, which includes a Base Period of up to 36 months, and a succession of unilateral options of two-three years duration.   This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with Public Law 103-355 (41 U.S.C. 264 note), and the information below is expressed as a statement of need for a commercial item, as outlined in FAR 12.202. This acquisition exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, and will be procured IAW Part 15.  The intent of this synopsis is to describe the required commercial items through the process described in FAR subpart 11.002. The Government further intends to use streamlined procedures to the extent practicable.  Part of the intent of this notice is to identify any appropriate commercial practices.  Additionally, it is the intent of NOAA to tailor the provision of FAR 52.212-1 and 52.212-4 to include addenda to the terms, estimated to include: indefinite quantity & indefinite delivery ordering; performance and quantity options; financing provisions, if applicable; progress reporting requirements; inspection and acceptance; and incentive provisions-if applicable to commercial practices.  A 150% optional quantity above the priced value is within the scope of this contract's ordering authority.  Minimum performance requirements are as follows: Bit Error Rate (BER) of 10-8;circuit delay of 600 milliseconds; and data availability of 99.5%.  Conceivably these requirements can be measured, quantified and potentially induced using positive and negative incentives.  Data quality, timeliness and availability are paramount objectives for the user at the DR&R destination.  It is presumed that DR&R data will flow by domestic satellite (DOMSAT) channels, at least for the Base period.  It is envisioned that a future architecture could include fiber optic channels, which will be considered if proposed for a future technology infusion plan that demonstrates capacity for accomplishment of the mission at decreased cost and improved technical efficiency. Data rate capacities will be listed as priced circuit links, and described in the documents described below.  IN RE: AVAILABILITY OF SPECIFICATIONS, PLANS, DRAWINGS, AND OTHER TECHNICAL DATA?it is impractical to distribute the applicable performance specifications with the solicitation. These documents may be examined at the originating office, by notifying the POC, or obtained by sending an electronic mail request with full address and contact data to jay.moore@noaa.gov with a reference to ''CP/DT Performance Specifications''.  An RFP is anticipated for release o/a April 24, 2002, with a Pre-solicitation conference o/a May 1, 2002.  IMPORTANT!! Those interested in this requirement should contact Mr. Jay W. Moore, NPOESS/Integrated Program Office, 8455 Colesville Road, Suite 1450, Silver Spring, MD 20910; Tel. 301-427-2126, ext. 112, and provide full contact information.  Requests by e-mail and letter will be honored with a rapid reply containing a description and diagrams of the requirements synopsized above.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Advanced Processing Laboratories, Inc., 16868 Via Del Campo Court, San Diego, CA 92127 on a sole source basis for The Control and Alarm Monitoring System (CAMS) and CAMS extender cable set.  The CAMS is required to be identical to existing Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) equipment and associated support and spare items required to ensure operational availability of systems upon deployment.  The CAMS is a custom system that provides the engine control and monitoring for the LCAC.  The extender cable set is custom designed and only works with the LCAC SLEP C4N craft.  Use of any other manufacturer's similar product would require complete redesign of the system and replacement of all fielded systems.  It's not practical to undertake a complete replacement of th is system in order to compete for the software support activity system.  Delivery will be to the Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, FL within 8 weeks of award of the contract.  A firm-fixed-price commercial item type contract is anticipated.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to procure on a sole source basis with Prof. Peter Turner, Bowie, MD for expert mathematical writing, editing, and consulting services on the theory, application and computation of the special functions of applied mathematics, and on supporting or related mathematical methodology; specifically, to acquire writing and editing of Chapter EF (Elementary Functions) of the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) which will become the standard world reference in its subject area.  This is a sole source procurement as the Contractor was chosen by an exacting selection process by the DLMF project leaders, assisted by an international board of nine eminent scientists from outside NIST, and is uniquely qualified to perform the work because of (1) his unique research accomplishments in the area of mathematics relevant to the chapter and (2) his general familiarity with the subject areas of the other DLMF chapters.  These attributes are critical, the first because each chapter will cover the current state-of-the-art in its subject area in great detail, and the second because the whole DLMF will reflect the rich mathematical interconnections that exist among the subject areas of all the chapters.  A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about April 17, 2002 with an eight month performance period.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing. This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, the Government will consider all responses received by the closing date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A solicitation will not be available.  See Note 26.

<DESC>The General Services Administration, Federal Technology Service, Small Business Solutions Development Center located in Kansas City, Missouri, intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a government-wide agency contract (GWAC) for information technology solutions. The RFP will be set-aside exclusively for HUBZone certified firms, and be divided into seven functional areas/scopes of work derived from 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes: 514191, 514199, 514210, 541511, 541512, 541513 and 541519. The contemplated multiple award, indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity contracts have a two-year base period with three one-year option periods, and permit work worldwide. A minimum of three awards in a functional area is required to operate the functional area, and no more than 10 awards will be made in any functional area. The maximum ceiling of the whole GWAC is $2.5 billion (U.S. currency), with no fixed allocation to any functional area. The GWAC ceiling balance available is reduced by the value of orders placed, and the maximum order limitation at any time is the GWAC ceiling balance remaining. This notification serves as the pre-solicitation notice of this proposed contract action, which the Federal Acquisition Regulation requires to precede the RFP issuance by at least 15 days. Accordingly, the Government anticipates issuing the RFP on or about January 2, 2002, with offers/proposals due no less than 30 days thereafter; proposals will be due on or about February 5, 2002 and the solicitation itself will provide those deadline details. The RFP will only be available by downloading it from www.fedbizopps.gov, and will be associated with the solicitation number.  The government will not provide hardcopy/paper solicitations and the contracting officer will not maintain solicitation mailing list records beyond what is available in the FedBizOpps system. Evaluation will be competitive and best value based, with non-price factors, when combined, significantly more important than price. The government is considering having a series of pre-proposal conferences and more information will be made available as they are established.  More information on HUBZone certification, which is administered by the Small Business Administration, is available via the Internet at www.sba.gov.  Numbered notes 26 & 27 apply.  

Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail and may be addressed to hubzone@gsa.gov. 

This pre-solicitation notification was originally issued in association with solicitation number 6TA-02-MTV-0055, but due to an unusual number of system errors/access issues, it has be re-released as a new pre-solicitation notice with the same information for the sake of clarity.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EERE supports DOE's strategic objectives of increasing the efficiency and productivity of energy use, while limiting environmental impacts; reducing the vulnerability of the U.S. economy to disruptions in energy supplies; ensuring that a competitive electric utility industry is in place that can deliver adequate and affordable supplies with reduced environmental impacts; supporting U.S. energy, environmental, and economic interests in markets; and delivering leading-edge technologies. A key component of this program is the support of information dissemination, public outreach, training and related technical analysis and technical assistance activities to: (1) Stimulate increased energy efficiency in transportation, buildings, and industry and increased use of renewable energy; (2) accelerate the adoption of new technologies to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy; (3) disseminate information to states, local governments and the public on EERE programs and technologies; and (4) address barriers to markets for EERE technologies. The purpose of this solicitation is to further these objectives through financial assistance in the following areas: Office of Power Technologies (OPT)--The primary mission of this Office is: (1) To enable U.S. industry to complete the research, testing and field verification needed to fully develop advanced wind energy technologies that lead the world in cost effectiveness and reliability; (2) dramatically reduce dependence on foreign oil by developing a next generation hydrogen energy system to meet the President's National Energy Policy goal of reliable, affordable and environmentally sound energy for America's future; (3) provide unbiased technical assessments and information to federal, regional, and state decision makers on the benefits and costs of electric utility restructuring issues related to renewable energy and energy efficiency; (4) setting goals for the President's energy vision as part of the National Energy Policy and the Strategic Program Review; (5) develop renewable energy generation technologies capable of economically increasing the deployment of non-hydroelectric renewable generation capacity to a total of at least 25,000 megawatts by 2010; and (6) work in partnership with U.S. industry to establish geothermal energy as an economically competitive contributor to the U.S. energy supply. Financial assistance applications will be requested for information dissemination, public outreach, and related technical analysis activities involving several specific renewable technologies such as wind, hydrogen and geothermal technologies. Also, applications will be requested to perform information dissemination, public outreach and related technical assistance for: the co-sponsorship of conferences involving the Power Technologies sector; Power Technologies analysis collaborative incentives analysis, information dissemination and outreach; and electricity restructuring. Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT)--The mission of this Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT) is to improve energy efficiency, environmental performance, and productivity of materials and process industries by developing and delivering advanced science and technology options that will: (1) Lower raw material and depletable energy use per unit output; (2) improve labor and capital productivity; and (3) reduce the generation of wastes and pollutants. OIT accomplishes its mission through its Industries: aluminum, steel, metal casting, glass, forest and paper products, chemicals, petroleum refining, agriculture-biobased products, and mining. At the national level, OIT has successfully facilitated the development of industry visions and technology roadmaps with these nine industries that are called the ``vision industries.'' Financial assistance applications will be requested to support information dissemination and outreach to facilitate multi-States implementation of the Industries of the Future program. Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT)--The primary mission of this Office operates several programs to help promote the introduction of alternative fuel and advanced fuel and advance vehicle technology (fuels, vehicles, infrastructure) into the domestic transportation system in a safe, economical, and businesslike manner. OTT also supports the deployment of technologies, providing needed support at critical points in the transition of technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace. In addition, OTT implements many activities related to the alternative fuel provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), including the Clean Cities program, federal fleet programs, analytical work, testing and evaluation, and regulatory efforts. Financial assistance applications will be requested to support information, dissemination and outreach activities for: co-sponsorship of conferences and events; training for local clean cities coalitions; and information dissemination and public outreach for niche markets. Office of Building Technology, State and Community Programs (BTS)-- The mission of this Office is to develop, promote, and integrate energy technologies and practices to make buildings more efficient and affordable and communities more livable. Financial assistance applications will be requested to support information dissemination, public outreach, and related technical analysis activities for the following BTS priorities: Addressing the efficient and renewable energy technology information deficit among commercial building constructors, owners, and managers; promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy utilization as a public value for residential builders and home buyers; increasing the availability of energy efficient school design, retrofit and technical resource information for school board members and school administrators; preparing the building trades, building operators, and building managers for the new generation of efficient and renewable energy technologies; promoting the widespread installation of dedicated compact fluorescent lamp fixtures; and strengthening the Rebuild America Program through outreach activities with stakeholder organizations representing facility managers, business officials and policy makers at colleges and universities, State and Local governments, elementary and secondary schools, and public and other low-income housing. Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP)--The mission of the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) is to reduce the cost and environmental impact of government resource use by advancing energy efficiency and water conservation, promoting the use of renewable energy and managing utility costs in Federal buildings, facilities and operations. This program supports the Department's priority to lead by example through the government's own actions. FEMP accomplishes this mission, in part, by providing guidance on the use of effective energy saving technologies. Lighting systems consume approximately 40% of total building electricity, on a national average, and represent the largest single opportunity for reducing the energy use of Federal facilities. This work will provide certification of lighting professionals to help ensure that new and retrofit lighting projects exhibit the highest degree of energy efficiency and effectiveness to meet the President's National Energy Policy goal of reducing the cost of government by reducing energy use in federal facilities. FEMP also promotes Federal leadership in energy management and increasing awareness and energy management expertise in the Federal sector by providing technical assistance to senior FEMP management and federal facility energy managers which requires technology transfer and information dissemination to broad audiences. Financial assistance will be requested to support several specific program areas such as a national lighting certification program for lighting professionals. Additional information about the programs of the Office of EERE can be obtained at the Office's Internet site at http://www.eren.doe.gov/ ee.html.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with Beckman Coulter Inc. of Miami, FL, for one (1) Coulter Multisizer 3 Particle Counter for counting micron size particles, plus accessories. ***Sole source determination is based on the following:  Beckman Coulter's instrument is able to not only count particles, but also gives an estimate of the particle volume.  Volume is important to estimate the amount of particle aggregation.  In addition, the Beckman Coulter Multisizer 3 uses conductivity changes to measure the passage of a particle through a small orifice.  This technique, unlike light scattering, is unaffected by particle color, shape, composition or refractive index.  The Coulter counter gives the particle number and size distribution, and works with very dilute samples.  The instrument's range is 0.4 microns to 1200 microns, which also represents a unique capability.  Thus, Beckman Coulter is uniquely qualified to provide an instrument meeting the Government's requirements. The Associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334513, with a small business size standard of 500 employees. ***No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by April 12, 2002.A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in Morgantown, WV is currently involved in an effort to reduce Fire Fighter Fatalities through the Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program.  Through the application of the program, causal and contributory factors of fire fighter fatalities and injuries are identified.  It has been illustrated through the investigations that many fire ground fatalities involve some type of radio communication problem.  Effective communications are needed by fire fighters on the fire ground in order to direct fire fighting operations and maintain contact with other fire fighters.  Many times radio communication is the only means of communication with others.  Information generated from this contract should guide NIOSH in targeting future research in an effort to better understand problems encountered with fire fighter radio communication system, and to identify solutions.   Our current requirement is entitled "Current Status, Knowledge Gaps and Research Needs Pertaining to Fire Fighter Radio Communication Systems."  The scope of work will be completed in three phases and should be completed within 8 months after contract award.  The first phase will be to perform a comprehensive literature review on what technology currently exists for fire fighter radio communications, the problems identified with current radio communication systems, and current research on radio communications systems.  Alternative radio communication technologies should be investigated that may be beneficial to the fire fighter problem (i.e. VLF, MF, spread spectrum, ultra-wide band, and blue tooth technologies); the second phase will be to conduct a knowledge-gaps analysis; and the last phase is to provide recommendations for research for improving fire fighter radio communication systems, and to prepare a final techical report summarizing all activities conducted under this contract.   The entire scope of work and evaluation factors are addressed in the solicitation.  Solicitation 2002-Q-00396 will be issued unrestricted on or about April 16, 2002, and proposals will be due on or about May 16, 2002.   The anticipated start date for this project is estimated to be no later than July 1, 2002.   Organizations interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation may submit a written request to: DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, ATTN: Brenda Goodwin, MS L-1019, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION #0002 - THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  THIS IS A RFI FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  This is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), Brooks AFB, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A&E) firms to perform Title I, Title II, and Other A&E Services to administrate, coordinate, and technically support environmental programs of interest to the government worldwide, but primarily on locations at Air Force installations in the 50 United States and Government territorial possessions.  For more information on the SOW, see the previous RFI F41624-02-RFI-0001.

 In light of the feedback received at the National Defense Industry Association Conference held in Charleston and industry responses to RFI 0001, request industry comment on the following additional questions:

1.  Information received from RFI 0001 responses indicate that teaming/joint ventures will be required to accomplish the Statement of Work requirements.  Teams and joint ventures add a complexity to the acquisition due to the increased proposal pages they add to offerors.  With this in mind, please provide responses/ideas on the recommended page limit for the DD Form 254s and DD Form 255s on this acquisition. 

2.  What are your thoughts on a computer or VTC based Pre-Proposal conference?  If you have participated in one, please provide details.

3.  Many different requirements are being considered as ?Add Ons? over and above the previous 3P-AE program.  We are interested in comments from industry on how AFCEE should score/evaluate these additional scope changes in comparison to the core environmental A-E requirements

Please include the following with your response: name and address of firm.  Please 
e-mail responses to Bea.DelosSantos@brooks.af.mil, Connie.Massenburg@brooks.af.mil, and Diane.Glass@brooks.af.mil no later than 5 Apr 02.  Since this is a RFI to be used in planning the acquisition, please do not send in a proposal.  The request for proposals, if and when issued, will be available on the Internet at FedBizOpps.gov.  As such, it is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any additional information.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) has a requirement for a Contractor to provide, engineer, install, test and maintain two High Altitude Electronic Magnetic Pulse (HEMP) and Blast Hardened microwave radio links and provide DS-3 service on these links from Cheyenne Mtn, CO and Schriever AFS, CO to Corral Bluffs, CO.  This requirement is in support of the Colorado Springs Survivable Communications Network.  The contractor shall provide commercial off-the-shelf equipment whenever possible.  All links and associated terminal equipment shall be protected against HEMP. The link to CMAS will also be blast protected.  Contract will be awarded for one (1) year with nine (9) one year options.  The Government does not intend to use Far Part 12 for this acquisition.  This requirement is a reaward of an existing 10 year AT&T contract DCA200-92-D-0056 and AT&T owns the HEMP facility at Corral Bluffs, CO.  AT&T also possesses the only complete set of technical data and drawings for the two blast hardened antennas at CMAS. The technical data and drawings are AT&T proprietary information.  Therefore, it is DITCO's intent to award a new 10 year contract to AT&T for this follow-on service.  DITCO will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) DCA200-02-R-5009 on or about 17 May 2002.  The RFP will be posted on the World Wide Web at http://www.ditco.disa.mil under "Contracting Opportunities" under "Information Technology RFP/RFQ/RFI" of the DITCO Homepage.  ALL inquiries regarding this synopsis shall be submitted electronically and directed to Terry L. Green, Contracting Officer, at greent@scott.disa.mil.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 513310, Wired Telecommunications Carriers - 1,500 employees, will be used for determining company size status.  See Note 22.

This is a sole source procurement as the Contractor was chosen by an exacting selection process by the DLMF project leaders, assisted by an international board of nine eminent scientists from outside NIST, and is uniquely qualified to perform the work because of (1) his unique research accomplishments in the areas of mathematics relevant to the chapters and (2) his general familiarity with the subject areas of the other DLMF chapters.  These attributes are critical, the first because each chapter will cover the current state-of-the-art in its subject area in great detail, and the second because the whole DLMF will reflect the rich mathematical interconnections that exist among the subject areas of all the chapters.  A fixed price Purchase Order will be issued on or about April 17, 2002 with an eight month performance period.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing. This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, the Government will consider all responses received by the closing date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A solicitation will not be available.  See Note 26.

<DESC>Modification to the Pre-Solicitation Notice

The Pre-Solicitation Notice for Solicitation Number GS-03P-02-AZC-0015 which previously posted on March 7, 2002 is being replaced with the following synopsis.  NOTE:  The Pre-Solicitation Conference scheduled for April 4, 2002 has been canceled until further notice:

Elevator Modernization and Preventive Maintenance Service at the J. Caleb Boggs Courthouse and Federal Building, 844 King Street, Wilmington, Delaware

The NAICS code applicable to this project is 235950.  The Project No. is RDE02566, and the Solicitation No. is GS-03P-02-AZC-0015.  The General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting proposals for the modernization of four (4) passenger elevators and one (1) passenger/service elevator in the J. Caleb Boggs Courthouse and Federal Building, 844 King Street, Wilmington, Delaware.  The elevator modernization project will include, but is not limited to the following:  Modernization of four passenger elevators, Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4; option for upgrading one passenger elevator No. 5; full preventive maintenance on all six (6) building elevators (including the prisoner elevator which is not being modernized) from the first day of the month following issuance of the notice to proceed, continuing through the installation period and for 12 months following the Government's acceptance of the project; and five 1- year options for preventive maintenance including additional services.  The estimated cost of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The contract will be acquired using Source Selection procedures as identified in FAR 15.3 with a firm fixed price award to the offeror who provides the best value to the Government.  This solicitation is being procured on an unrestricted basis.  Offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to product source and data, successful past performance, maintenance plan, key personnel qualifications, staffing plan, work schedule, phasing plan, subcontracting plan, participation of SDB firms and price proposals.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award without discussions.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are significantly more important than price.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1.  Product Source and Data,  2.  Past Performance, 3.  Maintenance Plan, 4.  Key Personnel Qualifications and Staffing Plan, 5.  Work Schedule/Phasing Plan/Subcontracting Plan, and 6.  Extent of Participation of Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Concerns.  Copies of this Solicitation (RFP) with drawings will be available on or about April 25, 2002.  However, as a result of recent events that have impacted the safety and security of people and facilities under control of the GSA, security procedures are being enacted to reduce the risk that sensitive unclassified material will be used for dangerous or illegal purposes.  Therefore, only authorized users will be issued a copy of the specification and drawings, and these documents cannot be copied once obtained.  The following procedures must be adhered to by all authorized users.  Offerors (both General Contractors and Subcontractors) who want a copy of the solicitation package must request from Brenda Haywood, Contract Specialist, a copy of ?DOCUMENT SECURITY, NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS.  This document must be completed with 
 a copy of the firm?s business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.

<DESC>As stated in the solicitation, the government intends to award without discussions.  Therefore, communication (also referred to as exchanges) with offerors regarding their proposals or the evaluation proceedings will be limited by the protocols in the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 

I will notify all interested parties (offerors) if their proposal is successful or unsuccessful for each functional area applied for as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations and will avoid exchanges until that time.  Unsuccessful parties will be afforded an opportunity for debriefing along with notification as being unsuccessful.  

Things I can not disclose at this time include, but are not limited to, both the number of offers and the identity of other offerors.

Some parties have asked me to verify if their proposal was received.  I need proof of the authenticity of the requester and that the requester is empowered by the offeror before I will share that information.  The best way to accomplish this is to send in a letter to me on corporate letterhead.  I will accept the letter by mail to me at - Matt T. Verhulst (6TA), GSA/FTS, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO  64131 -, by way of fax to me at 816.926.7474, or via e-mail to - hubzone@gsa.gov - with an attached scanned copy of the letter.  In response to what is ostensibly a valid request I will simply acknowledge receiving or not receiving a package from that source.

Please consider the preceding before attempting to contact me regarding proposals or the evaluations at this juncture.

<DESC>Initiative: This Sources Sought announcement is hereby submitted by the Area Attack System Program Office, Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, Florida.  The Air Force plans to contract for the development of a common Precision Guided Munitions Planning Software (PGMPS) Program.  This acquisition was cancelled last year due to lack of funding.  Funding is now confirmed to be available.  However, this announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  Objective: PGMPS shall be a Unique Planning Component (UPC) of the USAF Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). The overall program objective is to provide a single PGM mission planning application integrated with JMPS.  PGMPS shall provide a common user interface for all PGM mission planning and a single interface control document (ICD) to define the integration with carrier aircraft UPCs.  PGMPS must be compliant with the Defense Information Infrastructure-Common Operating Environment (DII-COE) to the same level specified for JMPS.  Contract Scope and Award: The basic contract shall deliver mission planning software for the Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and the Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD) in the initial release (version 1.0); if funding is provided, Version 1.0 will be followed by another release (version 2.0, one year later) that will include the addition of the Small Diameter Bomb.  A planned third release will add the AGM-130, GBU-15, and EGBU-15 weapons to PGMPS.   Version 1.0 must include a common PGMPS UPC-to-Aircraft UPC ICD that governs the integration of PGMPS with all applicable aircraft mission-planning applications. It is anticipated that the contract shall include several options for software upgrades to accommodate changes driven by the JMPS framework, integration of additional aircraft with the existing PGMPS, and the probability of adding additional weapons.  Version 1.0 must be delivered, certified for operational test, not later than February 2004 (assuming the JMPS schedule does not significantly slip).  Version 2.0 must be fielded by February 2005, and follow-on releases shall occur annually in February of each subsequent year.   An RFP release date of March 2002 is anticipated with a subsequent contract award planned for September 2002.  Statement of Capability (SOC): Interested firms should submit a SOC within 30 days of this announcement to Ms. Robin A. Mayberry, AAC/YHK, 102 West D Avenue, Suite 300, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6808.  The SOC must include, but is not limited to, successful experience or capability as a contractor in: (1) integrating Government-provided software and contractor-developed software, (2) the development, integration, and testing of mission planning software and weapon-specific mission planning software, and (3) facilities and personnel to handle and store classified information at the TOP SECRET level. Contractors that have previously submitted a SOC for this effort as synopsized under solicitation number F08635-00-R-0005 need only submit a letter stating any applicable changes and addressing their size standard for the herein cited NAICS code.  As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort.   Small Business: Firms responding to this synopsis should state whether or not they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone certified, woman-owned, historically black college or university or any other minority concern as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-1 and FAR 52.219-2. The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition shall be 541511 with a size standard of $18M.  A decision as to whether this acquisition shall be full and open competition or small business set-aside shall be based on responses to this synopsis and other market research.  Points of Contact: Direct questions related to contracting matters to Ms. Robin A. Mayberry, Contracting Specialist, (850) 882-3416, Ext. 3252 or Mr. Mack Kirkland, Contracting Officer, (850) 882-3416 Ext. 3162.

An ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

<SUBJECT>10--SPECIAL PURPOSE RECEIVER (SPR) FOR THE M16/M4-SERIES RIFLES AND CARBINES
<SOLNBR>N00164-02-R-0077
<RESPDATE>043002
<CONTACT>Paul Johnson, Contract Specialist, 812-854-3225, FAX 812-854-5095
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement is for the re-initiation of an earlier project that was delayed due to urgent support of current hostilities. This announcement constitutes a Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) and a synopsis of an upcoming solicitation.  This CAA cancels and replaces SOL N00164-01-R-0103. This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operation Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program and other federal agencies.  A solicitation will be published on or about 19 April 2002 that seeks to award IDIQ contracts to vendor(s) who can provide accessory parts and assemblies for performance improvements to the M16/M4-series rifles/car bines.  Specifically required are Special Purpose Receivers (SPRs) for both short and long range precision fire, with improved MILSPEC 1913 rail interfaces, as well as related improved weapons parts and assemblies.  These improvements may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI), Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), or NDI/COTs that can be rapidly developed into suitable items for US Special Operations and Law Enforcement.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and equipment to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its equipment, normal military specifications are in many cases not stringent enough to support SOF use. Although the currently fielded M16-series Rifles and M4A1 Carbine s meet military performance specifications, these weapons have exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, OBJECTIVE 1 (SPR Rail Interface): Sources are sought for new SOPMOD rail interface designs. The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD Rail Interface System (RIS, NSN 1005-01-416-1089), rather is seeking alternative Forearm rail subsystems with improved operational performance characteristics:   (a) RAIL POSITIONS: As with the current SOPMOD RIS, MILSPEC 1913 rails are still required in the 12:00, 3:00, 6:00, and 9:00 positions on the rifle/carbine forearm.  As an objective, the SPR 12:00 rail will be continuous and unbroken from the rear of the upper receiver to the forward gas assembly to permit rig id mechanical alignment of eye-axis aiming accessories. (b) FORWARD COMPATIBILITY WITH FUTURE EGLM:  A rigid or monolithic interface method is desired that will allow a future EGLM to be mounted in the 6:00 position, while (1) withstanding the shock of firing all currently fielded 40mm Low Velocity rounds, (2) maintaining zero repeatability of the EGLM when removed and remounted, (3) allow the EGLM to be mounted as closely to the rifle/carbine barrel as possible without interfering with host weapon barrel harmonics during firing. 4.  GENERAL, OBJECTIVE 2 (SPR Performance): To ensure system balance, also sought are rifle/carbine parts, components, subassemblies, or modifications that enhance reliability, endurance, safety, and operational performance as compared to the current M16/M4 series rifles/carbines. The Government is not seeking alternative sources of current parts for  the current M16-series/M4A1 carbines, rather is seeking alternative parts and subassemblies that significantly increase weapon reliability and performance.  (A) PARTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES:  These improvements, listed in priority order of government interest, may include new and improved (1) magazines, (2) bolt assemblies/bolt carrier groups, (3) barrels, (4) upper receivers and upper receiver groups, (5) trigger, sear, and hammer sets, (6) ambidextrous weapon controls, (7) flip-up/spring-up front and rear iron sights, (8) front and rear pistol grips, (9) buttstocks, and (10) bipods any other components of, or mechanical accessories to, the M16-series/M4A1 carbines, with the exception of the lower receiver. The government wishes to avoid modifications to the lower receiver.   (B) VERSIONS: The SPR, should be optimized for (1) precision fire operations, and (2) a capability to ad apt weapon to mission needs with barrel lengths appropriate to the operational mode.  The barrel lengths are nominally 9 to 11.5 inches for close quarters battle and 16 to 18 inches for precision fire.  All versions must fit M16/M4 series lower receivers.  Parts commonality between the two versions is a secondary goal.  (C) OTHER PERFORMANCE GOALS: (1) Increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, ease of cleaning, lubricity/reduced friction; fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds (Threshold)/30,000 rounds (Objective), performing up to the standards and firing rates to be published in the Solicitation, functional reliability exceeding that of the standard M4A1 carbine at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf) environmental conditions (2) Improved safety- delay cook-off, fail-safe features, fires/functions safely  and without delay of draining in the Over-The-Beach (surf zone, weapon flooded with water) environment. (3) User Acceptance: operational suitability, increased live-fire hit scores, decreased live-fire engagement times, speed/accuracy of engagement, controllability in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, improved handling qualities, light weight, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method.  Items will be selected on a “Best Value” Contracting basis.  IDIQ contracts will be awarded to offerors in accordance with the following plan:   (A) RCO Solicitation is anticipated to be published on or about April or May 2002.  The RCO solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Please do not respond to this advisory announcement  until such time as the RCO solicitation is published.   (B) Solicitation is expected to close on or about May or June 2002.  Upon the closure date and time, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include (if needed), as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  The evaluation process is expected to follow the below step.  A Source Selection Board (SSB) will then be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Team (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  A Test and Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.   The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of ad jectival voting scores, and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.  Also, an SSB Chairman will be assigned by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) to chair the SSB.  Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains technical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.   The CMET will provide the third most important results.  How ever, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons or for unreasonable prices.  Vendors who propose more rapid delivery schedules and can prove that they can meet those schedules will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  This project seeks to field equipment in a time frame that is relevant to current conflicts.  Delivery of first articles is August 2002 (Objective)/March 2003 (Threshold). The Source Selection Panel will then establish the competitive range. Offerors of proposals found to be in the competitive range will be invited to renovate their proposals based on SSB findings and to proceed to the next stage of competition, which will be Oral Presentation/Demonstration.   (C) Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, will be conducted on or about June or July 2002 at a location to be announce d.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors in the competitive range and clarify/discuss the offerors’ technical proposals. It is expected that some limited product demonstrations will be allowed at this time. Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct a second adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award.  The SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found.   (D) Follow-on Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.    6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisit ion Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS, the Government invites potential Offerors to respond to the Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation when it is published. No solicitation document exits at this time. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS ADVISORY ONLY.  THIS REQUIREMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PUBLISHED PREVIOUSLY FOR INDUSTRY COMMENT.  DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, RATHER PLEASE WAIT TO FORMALLY RESPOND TO THE RCO SOLICITATION WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this CAA. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government. The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement. The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or RIS parts drawings.  7.  RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS.  Please do not be confused by related gove rnment announcements.  While SOPMOD is seeking Offerors, or teams of Offerors, to provide fully system-balanced offerings for SPR, certain sub-components and closely related accessories will be competed separately on different solicitations, three of which are: (A) Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module (EGLM) Parties interested in EGLM should view and respond to solicitation N00164-02-R-0063, which can be found at http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/synopsis.htm    (B) Family of Muzzle Brake/Suppressors (FMBS).   Parties interested in FMBS should watch for separate announcements which have been published under SOL N00164-02-R-0065 - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - FSG 10 - NAICS 332994.  FMBS will affect SPR participants in the future, in that SPR offerings should be insensitive to muzzle attachments.  SPR selectees may be required to produce offerings that are compatible with the future S OPMOD FMBS, as well as the current SOPMOD QD Sound Suppressor (Sound Suppressor Kit, NSN1005-01-437-0324)   8.

<DESC>Te Bureau of the Census in Jeffersonville, Indiana is requesting information for a possible acquisition of laser sorting macines for use in the 2010 Census.  We are researching the capability to sort interleaved 2 of 5 barcode mailing packages on laser sorters. The sorters will need the capability to either check the barcode on the form against a file that is loaded on the sorter or against a network file and make a decision of (1) Will the mailing package remain in the mailing or (2) be osted out to be discarded.  A mailing package is defined as (1) Letter size with a height of 4.6 inches to 6 inches by 6.5 inches up to 12.5 inches. Thickness of .1 inches to .3 inches and (2) Flat size with a height of 6 to 9 inches by 10.5 inches to 12.5 inches.  Thickness of .1 inch to .3 inch.  The length of the interleved 2 of 5 bar code should be operator configurable.  The bar code head should be mechanically adjustable to allow for different bar code placements on the envelopes.  The reader should be able to read on a window or through glassine.  Bar code orientation should be horizontal or picket fence.  Minimum bar thickness 0.017 inches <=X<=0.022 inches.  Maximum digits is 22.  Bar code eight is 1/2 inch.  Wide to narrow ration (N): 2.2<=N<=3.0 (must be at least 2.5 if the narrow width is less than 0.020 inches.

<CONTACT>Dennis Jeffrey, Senior Procurement Analyst, Phone 702-295-2192, Fax 702-295-2088, Email jeffredj@nv.doe.gov
<DESC>DOWNDRAFT TABLE
Bechtel Nevada has identified the need for a design construct project to provide an operational Down Draft Table Facility within an existing building on the Nevada Test Site (NTS), located approximately 60 miles outside of Las Vegas, Nevada.  The Down Draft Table Facility will be used to assemble components including materials that must be contained to minimize dispersion and the resultant contamination.  Personnel performing these operations will be appropriately dressed for these hands-on activities.  

WHAT IS A DOWN DRAFT TABLE?
The down draft table is a stainless steel table with a 3 foot square precision granite slab mounted in an opening in the top of the table. Operations personnel will use the granite block as a work surface.  There is sufficient clearance around the granite slab to allow laminar air flow downward around all the sides of the granite.  The laminar air flow must be of sufficient velocity to minimize release of materials from the table.  The velocity of laminar flow around the granite block must be moderated to minimize dispersion of any particulate matter that is captured within the flow while operations personnel are moving their hands, arms, tools, etc. through the flow.  The air through the table must be filtered through one or more High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters prior to being discharged out of the facility.  

WHAT IS A DOWN DRAFT TABLE FACILITY?
The down draft table facility consists of the down draft table, a primary confinement system, a secondary confinement system, a tertiary confinement system, and the required supporting mechanical, electrical and auxiliary systems.  The down draft table will be installed in a new 12-foot square, free-standing primary confinement area, which is the area Operations personnel will occupy while performing the above described activities.   The new primary confinement area will be installed in a new secondary confinement area. The secondary confinement area will be installed in an existing building which is regarded as the tertiary confinement system.  Thus, the project for a subcontractor as currently constituted consists of the down draft table, the primary confinement system, and the secondary confinement system.

Three levels of air pressure will be maintained in the down draft room facility:  (1) pressure over and below the down draft table working surface, (2) pressure in the primary containment structure, and (3) pressure in the secondary containment structure. These three pressure levels will decrease moving inward from the secondary containment, or in other words, the table/primary area will be more negative than the secondary area; and, the secondary area will be more negative than the tertiary area.

The list of requested vendor information for this sources sought announcement should include, but not be limited to:
identification of similar projects that the vendor has participated in; vendor's scope of activities in each of those projects and the client's business references relative to that work; years of business experience relevant to this type of work; and resume's of key personnel. 

A formal Request for Proposal will be issued at a later date to all vendors who are determined to be capable of supplying the required system.

<SUBJECT>A -- Predictive Battle Awareness
<DESC>Predictive Battlespace Awareness.  DARPA's Information Exploitation Office (IXO) seeks to validate a notional approach to Level 2/3 information fusion by 1) defining target applications, progress metrics, and notional architecture; 2) answering key technical questions; 3) sizing the effort; and 4) assessing the risk reward.  This validation will take the form of a feasibility assessment and a scoping study.  The feasibility assessment will be accomplished by implementing a "blackboard" framework and a dynamic Bayes Net inference engine, and demonstrating that Level 2/3 products can be produced under constrained conditions.  The scoping study will estimate system parameters, identify technical alternatives, and provide cost/benefit analyses of a full scale system.  DARPA intends to enter into contract with Information Extraction & Transport, Inc., sole-source, for the purpose of accomplishing this validation.  The contract's value will be less than one million dollars; its period of performance will be eight months.  IET is the only source know to the Government with the resident capability and personnel that can be reasonably expected to accomplish this validation with the Government's cost and schedule constraints.  This announcement is neither a request for proposals, nor a competitive solicitation of any kind; see Note No. 22.
