a.	Conservation Measure 1 - Lighting 

(1)	Upgrade the existing fluorescent, T12 lamp fixtures in all buildings (as listed below, attachment 1) with energy-efficient T8 lamps and electronic ballasts.  The light fixture should be free of any dirt and grime so that light reflection is not inhibited.  Generally, use “Cool White” (4100 Kelvin) lamps for offices, classrooms, and working areas.  Use “Warm White” (3000 Kelvin) lamps for dormitory halls and common areas and other residential areas. T8 Lamps and energy efficient ballasts shall meet or exceed Department of Energy Efficiency Recommendations.  Refer to this website for details: (http://www.eere.energy.gov/femp/about/about.cfm). Provide separate quantity and cost, by building to upgrade any additional fixtures found in the building.  
(2)	Replace incandescent lamps with equivalent compact fluorescent lamps. 
(3)	In addition to the requirements noted in above, the up-grade shall provide illumination levels that are equal to or greater than those existing.  The illumination levels listed in Attachment 2 are provided as a guide.  At Substantial Completion of the work, the acceptance level of illumination will be measured and compared with these requirements.

b.	Conservation Measure 2 – Occupancy Sensors

(1)	Install passive infrared motion sensors in areas designated. Further, the manufacturer’s instructions should be followed for the duration of the “Off” cycles to prevent over-cycling the lamps.  Over-cycling will reduce the life span of the lighting equipment.  The contractor is to verify all quantities and replacement types on site.  Provide prices per unit for each item listed.  
(2)	Use the chart below as a guide to determine appropriate lamp replacements.

<CONTACT>AnneMarie Ternay, (609) 485-6990
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) Section 3.2.1.3.12 and T3.2.1.2, industry is hereby informed that the FAA has a potential requirement for communications using approved Federal Bridge certificates and is seeking information from potential vendors. PURPOSE: This market survey is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  Based on the responses received, a subsequent Screening Information Request (SIR) may be submitted to industry for the purpose of selecting a vendor who meets the requirements stated herein.  However, this market survey does not commit the FAA to any future acquisition activity.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense. At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from all interested vendors capable of providing Federal Bridge certificates. This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms. The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334220, Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing, with a size standard of 750 employees over the past 3 years.  BACKGROUND: The WJHTC has a need for data exchange with a variety of internal and external entities.  These entities can include FAA facilities, FAA contractors, airlines and other aviation-related entities, other government agencies both domestic and foreign, Department of Defense agencies, and commercial entities.   In December 2000, the Federal Chief Information Officer's Council approved the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) Certificate Policy. The policy defines the FBCA as an interoperability mechanism for ensuring trust across disparate domains. Successful cross certification with the FBCA asserts that the Applicant Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) operates in accordance with the standards, guidelines and practices of the Federal Public Key Infrastructure Policy Authority (FPKI Policy Authority) and of the Federal PKI Steering Committee (FPKISC).   See http://www.cio.gov/fbca. As a result the WJHTC has a need for services to issue and recognize certificates that are compliant with FBCA requirements. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: The offeror selected to provide these services shall substantiate and demonstrate that they meet the following mandatory requirements.   1.	Any entity supplying this service must be cross-certified under the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) (see http://www.cio.gov/fbca/techio.htm) and be able to issue certificates, including high assurance certificates.   2.	Demonstrated capability of Develop a Registration Practice Statement (RPS) that is in compliance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance and standards and the FBCA requirements.  PRICING SUBMISSION: At this time, the number of labor hours required for item nos. 1 and 2 below, as well as the number of certificates required for item no. 3 below, are not yet known.  However, the Government is requesting pricing information in terms of the types of labor categories and labor rates that would be required to accomplish item nos. 1 and 2.  For item no. 3, the pricing per certificate, per year is requested. 1.	Develop a Registration Practice Statement (RPS) that is in compliance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance and standards and the FBCA requirements.  This includes, but is not limited to, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201 Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors (see http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/). 2.	Develop a trust model to recognize and validate certificates from entities that already have Federal Bridge compliant certificates.  These certificates should be recognized and accepted at the level they were issued, including high assurance certificates.  The model should determine which circumstances that external certificates are to be accepted and which circumstances that the FAA will issue new certificates. 3.	Issue certificates within the guidelines of the RPS as needed to FAA, FAA contractors or others that need to exchange data with the FAA.

<CONTACT>Gayle McClelland, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-427-1573, Fax 301-427-1740, Email gayle.mcclelland@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is soliciting proposals is for a project that is part of AHRQ?s new Joining Forces initiative which aims to capitalize on the joint power of administrative data and health IT to support quality improvement, health care transparency and research.  Through two complementary contract solicitations issued simultaneously, AHRQ will support projects to add more detailed clinical data to statewide administrative databases.  These projects build on recent work sponsored by AHRQ that assessed the incremental value of adding particular clinical data elements.  In the first project an in-depth pilot will be conducted in one or more states to add or link hospital clinical information to administrative (discharge abstract or claims) data.  In the second project, a limited number of smaller planning awards will be provided to statewide data organizations that are not yet ready to engage in a pilot but that seek to enhance their administrative datasets with more clinical data.  This solicitation is for the first type of project? to provide support to pilot efforts to enhance statewide all-payer hospital administrative data by adding more clinical information. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that best describes the requirement is 541611.  The small business size standard is $6.5 million (provided for information only, as this procurement is advertised on a limited competition among qualified offerors basis). These two types of projects (pilot projects and planning projects) will focus on expanding the data capacities of statewide data organizations participating in HCUP and is therefore open to any HCUP Partner that meets the qualifications stated herein.  To be eligible the HCUP partner must meet or exceed the following criteria: The organization must provide statewide inpatient data to AHRQ, and in many cases provide ambulatory surgery and emergency department data as well. If any HCUP partners that individually are unable to meet this requirement are encouraged to partner with subcontractors, as appropriate, to accomplish their proposed project.  These data are used to build a family of HCUP databases for national, state, regional and local analyses.  Improving the clinical robustness of HCUP Partner data will enable the statewide data organizations to produce more accurate and expanded quality assessments of hospitals in their state.  It will also improve the HCUP databases to which these Partners contribute, thus enhancing the accuracy and comprehensiveness of quality assessment at the state and national levels (e.g. as reported in the National Healthcare Quality Report).  Enhanced clinical data in HCUP databases will also support more robust analyses that provide the evidence base for quality improvement efforts. 
AHRQ may award more than one contract from this solicitation.  If multiple awards are made, each Contractor will work independently on their projects.  Each awardee will also participate in peer-to-peer learning forums with other pilot project and planning project contractors to exchange knowledge and lessons learned.  Under separate AHRQ sponsorship, the HCUP contractor and its subcontractors with expertise in administrative data, health IT, and data exchange, will serve a convening and technical assistance role for the peer-to-peer learning process.  The HCUP contractor will also synthesize findings from the final reports of all pilot project and planning project contractors to create a report that AHRQ will disseminate to other statewide data organizations on the lessons learned from these projects.
In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ?s site at http://ahrq.gov . Once in AHRQ?s homepage go to ?Funding Opportunities?, then to ?Contracts?, and then to ?Request for Proposal (RFP)?. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about June 1, 2007 with proposals due July 2, 2007.

<SUBJECT>B -- Adding Clinical Data to Statewide Administrative Data: Planning Projects
<SOLNBR>AHRQ-07-10043
<CONTACT>Gayle McClelland, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-427-1573, Fax 301-427-1740, Email gayle.mcclelland@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is soliciting proposals is for a project that is part of AHRQ?s new Joining Forces initiative which aims to capitalize on the joint power of administrative data and health IT to support quality improvement, health care transparency and research.  Through two complementary contract solicitations issued simultaneously, AHRQ will support projects to add more detailed clinical data to statewide administrative databases.  These projects build on recent work sponsored by AHRQ that assessed the incremental value of adding particular clinical data elements.  In the first project an in-depth pilot will be conducted in one or more states to add or link hospital clinical information to administrative (discharge abstract or claims) data.  In the second project, a limited number of smaller planning awards will be provided to statewide data organizations that are not yet ready to engage in a pilot but that seek to enhance their administrative datasets with more clinical data.  This solicitation is for the second type of project?a project to conduct planning activities needed to add detailed clinical information to statewide administrative data.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that best describes the requirement is 541611.  The small business size standard is $6.5 million (provided for information only, as this procurement is advertised on a limited competition among qualified offerors basis). These two types of projects (pilot projects and planning projects) will focus on expanding the data capacities of statewide data organizations participating in HCUP and is therefore open to any HCUP Partner that meets the qualifications stated herein.  To be eligible the HCUP partner must meet or exceed the following criteria: The organization must provide statewide inpatient data to AHRQ, and in many cases provide ambulatory surgery and emergency department data as well. If any HCUP partners that individually are unable to meet this requirement are encouraged to partner with subcontractors, as appropriate, to accomplish their proposed project.  These data are used to build a family of HCUP databases for national, state, regional and local analyses.  Improving the clinical robustness of HCUP Partner data will enable the statewide data organizations to produce more accurate and expanded quality assessments of hospitals in their state.  It will also improve the HCUP databases to which these Partners contribute, thus enhancing the accuracy and comprehensiveness of quality assessment at the state and national levels (e.g. as reported in the National Healthcare Quality Report).  Enhanced clinical data in HCUP databases will also support more robust analyses that provide the evidence base for quality improvement efforts. AHRQ may award more than one contract from this solicitation.  If multiple awards are made, each Contractor will work independently on their projects.  Each awardee will also participate in peer-to-peer learning forums with other pilot project and planning project contractors to exchange knowledge and lessons learned.  Under separate AHRQ sponsorship, the HCUP contractor and its subcontractors with expertise in administrative data, health IT, and data exchange, will serve a convening and technical assistance role for the peer-to-peer learning process.  The HCUP contractor will also synthesize findings from the final reports of all pilot project and planning project contractors to create a report that AHRQ will disseminate to other statewide data organizations on the lessons learned from these projects.
In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ?s site at http://ahrq.gov . Once in AHRQ?s homepage go to ?Funding Opportunities?, then to ?Contracts?, and then to ?Request for Proposal (RFP)?. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about June 1, 2007 with proposals due July 2, 2007.

The specifications will be available the same day and can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.    Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following URL http://www.FedTeDS.gov.   You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled Register with FedTeDS and then choosing the Vendor Registration Form hyperlink.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company?s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company?s, CCR Point of Contact) your Company?s DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing  paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online  as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.   Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.  Mail, facsimile, telephonic or electronic mail requests for these documents will not be honored.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Directorate of Procurement intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with DRS Unmanned Technologies, Inc., 6300 Columbia Street, Mineral Wells, TX 76067 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1.  The purpose of this procurement action will be for CLS to maintain the Neptune II systems to be delivered in 2007 and for the procurement of additional VCUAS capability.  After evaluation of the responses received to the RFI issued 05 Oct 06, USSOCOM has determined that no other supplier can provide the Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for existing Neptune II Unmanned Aircraft Systems or can design, develop, test, and manufacture Vehicle Craft Unmanned Aircraft System (VCUAS) systems within the timeframe called out in RFI to satisfy USSOCOM requirements.  Moreover, no other supplier responding to the RFI identified a system capable of operating and landing in the saltwater environment.  Based on results of the RFI and USSOCOM knowledge of the UAS market place, DRS UT, Inc is the only firm with the existing logistic support and manufacturing capability that is mature enough to meet VCUAS requirements within the established timeframe.  DRS maintains proprietary ownership of the engineering and maintenance technical order data rights to Neptune II.   Given the level of technology readiness of other contractors, the Government would be required to spend significant resources and considerable time for other suppliers to reach comparable support and manufacturing levels.  The DRS Neptune II is the only system available to meet the VCUAS requirement for operating in a maritime environment from small platforms.   The Government anticipates awarding one contract related to this announcement for a period of approximately five years with a potential maximum of up to $50,000,000.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency?see Note 22.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Ms. Kim DeBois-Sousa, Contracting Officer, Phone (813) 826-7077, Fax (813) 826-7504, Email Deboisk@socom.mil

<DESC>Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) Acquisition and Procurement Office (A&PO) is planning to award a contract to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.  Only firms that are Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses should apply.  These firms should have current, relevant qualifications, experience, personnel, and capability to construct a smoke control system.
The Pentagon Renovation and Construction Program (PENREN) "Alt Sites" team is responsible for the Planning, Design, Construction and Project Management of major renovation and upgrade to the Under Ground Facility (UGF) and site to support its Mission. 
This UGF and site has been in existence since the early 1950's and has continued in operation. A needs assessment was completed, and the resulting information generated a necessity to provide more effective method of smoke control. The existing methods available for smoke control are not automated. An upgraded system is needed to improve the methods for dealing with a fire emergency and improve life safety during the course of such an event.
Design and build a system which would inhibit the flow of smoke into areas of egress, corridors, stairwells and the inner roadway. It would be activated automatically during the early stages of a fire to compartmentalize the smoke and to maintain a survivable environment, e.g. contain the smoke in the fire zone of origin, especially for those personnel evacuating from the more remote corridors and offices. The smoke control system would function during the period of personnel evacuation from the areas protected by the system. Moreover, this system would facilitate search and rescue operations by emergency response personnel. 
This project will create compartmentalized smoke control zones at minimum, coordinated with the fire zones, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) controls throughout the site. The system would provide the capability to automatically or manually operate fans, dampers and doors to protect egress areas during an emergency such as a fire. A 1998 Smoke Control Design by Nutec is available as a reference document upon request. This document is not up to date and should not be relied upon as completely accurate. Contractor is responsible for verifying any information taken from this document.
In accordance with FAR 36.206, the estimated magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Due to the sensitive nature of the work location, prospective contractors are required to possess an active facility clearance.  The geographic location where the work is to be performed is in southern Pennsylvania near the Maryland border.
DO NOT REQUEST SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS UNTIL THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL IS ISSUED.     The proposed solicitation number will be HQ0034-07-R-0005 and will be issued on or about 30 July 2007. A copy of the solicitation can be obtained from www.FedBizOpps.gov.     Proposals will be due approximately 30 days later on or about 30 August 2007. Award is expected to be made on or about 29 September 2007. For any inquiried, please contact Randall Jewett, Contract Administrator, via email: randall.jewett.ctr@whs.mil ; telephone number 703-695-3799, fax number 703-614-6329.

<DESC>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the procurement of mobile incinerators.

NAMSA is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. NAMSA intends to use the one step ICB procedure. Partial bidding is not allowed. 

The Department of Commerce will be using as its reference for the mobile incinerator procurement IFB-NAMSA-5HQ27007-30. The procurement is part of Project 5HQ27007, Provision of Waste and Sewage Treatment and Collection System Required for the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF), which is part of Capability Package 5A0156, NATO Deployable HQ Assets for CJTF. 

The information to be provided to the bidders will be up to the level of NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Background: The original Capability Package for 1500- and 2000- man camps has been revised. The new Capability Package, tailored to suit the Deployable Communication Information System (DCIS) Baseline Capability, now consists of one 1000-man camp consisting of a HQ and Support Module tailored for the CJTF land-based requirement and two 500-man living accommodation modules, plus one 1000-man camp consisting of a HQ and Support module tailored for the CJFACC requirement and two 500-man living accommodation modules, and two remote CIS sites with living accommodation for 15 personnel each.

As a result, a number of self-contained camps, each with 500 full-time occupants and a small commercial or industrial function, will be built so that each has its own solid waste collection and disposal system. While the function of each camp will be unique, the intent is to have only two incinerator models. One incinerator model will include a waste oil burner to dispose of waste oil and used tires, and the other model will only incinerate the normal domestic and commercial waste load. Each incinerator is expected to handle up to 2000 kg of waste per day, 6 days per week. Because of likely locations of these camps, hygiene and sanitation throughout the waste collection and disposal process is of utmost importance.

All assets must be capable of being moved by road, rail, and sea. Assets acquired must comply with the 6.058 meter x 2.438 meter x 2.591 meter ISO standard sea container in terms of structural components and handling methodology. The weight of the components will preclude many components from being transportable by C-130 aircraft. However, pipe lengths are limited to approximately 6 meters, and the containers for that pipe are limited to 2.438 meters in height to allow C-130 transport. This may allow an early arrival of pipe, which would facilitate the erection of the camp.

The climatic requirements for the mobile incinerators were derived from STANAG 2895 for the range of A1 to C1 Climatic Zones. The equipment must be capable of sustaining effective operations over a variety of terrain and in ambient temperatures ranging between -32 degrees C and +49 degrees C (-33 degrees C for storage and transit). The assets must be capable of withstanding winds rated at 52 m/s (185 kph), snow loads at 240kg/m2, and be capable of preventing infiltration by heavy rains and insects.

While recycling where possible, an incinerator capable of handling 2000 kg of solid waste per day will be acquired for four 500-man modules. This incinerator will burn at least 6 days per week and thus will require no significant on-site storage of solid waste. The incinerator will use diesel fuel and will meet incinerator standards set by European and North American countries. Although a 1000-man incinerator was considered, the 500-man incinerator more readily meets the 6.058 meter sea container standard for transport and is coherent with the modularity and self-sufficiency required of the camp.

Incineration Standards: Incineration is the preferred method of disposal, so that all waste that can be responsibly incinerated will be collected and burned. This waste will include that collected from the other-waste bins located in the separation points, commercial and industrial solid waste, classified documents, a limited amount of medical waste, dewatered sewage sludge, compacted kitchen waste, waste oil and other waste vehicle fluids, and a limited number of tires. This waste must be incinerated with emissions limited to that set by European Union Directive 2000/76/EC, given effect by Statutory Instrument 275 of 2003 for new, non-hazardous waste incinerators.

Scrubbing of emission gases to meet the EU regulations will be undertaken, if required. These scrubbers must be as simple as possible, must reduce emissions so that they are within the European Union standards mentioned above, and must not produce liquid by-products that require more than sewage treatment before being disposed of into the environment.

Residues of solid waste from the scrubbers shall be placed into closed containers for further disposal elsewhere.

Ash: Ash must meet the European standards of EU Directive 2000/76/EC.

Water Discharges: Waste water discharged from the quenching of exhaust gases will be treated in the camp waste water treatment facility as standard grey water waste. Discharges will be measured as indicated in EU Directive 2000/76/EC and must meet the standards established in that directive.

Transportability: All containers are subject to off-road movement by the military Deployable Rapid Operations Platform System (DROPS) for container handling. It is important that the internal fittings, packaging, and dunnaging withstand such conditions, in particular the steep angle of loading and unloading.

Waste Oil Storage: Two of the four units will have waste oil burners incorporated. Storage for this oil, including crankcase oil, transmission fluid, hydraulic and break fluid, and contaminated diesel and helicopter fuel, will be in an accessible tank of at least 500 liters. Waste oil burning will be given priority so as to maximize the use of waste oil as incinerator fuel.

Electrical Requirements: Only one electrical service entry per incineration facility will be allowed. All of the electrical loads and appliances in the facility will be served by the single service entry.

The contractor will receive power from the camp grid at 400/230 V, 50 Hz, 3 phase. Power will be provided to a single molded, self-extinguishing PVC panel through one fixed male plug from a female socket. The contractor will supply the male plug and panel, whereas connections to the grid, including the female socket, will be by others. All plugs will meet EN 60309 (3 P + N + PE) for 3 phase power and will be recessed from the surface to avoid damage during shipping and handling.

Where 230 V 50 Hz single phase power is used, waterproof power outlets shall be spring-loaded lid type SCHUKO outlets at approved 10 ? 16 Amp rating (maximum allowable rating in any socket 16 Amp) that conforms to CEE 7/4 Type F. Numbers and locations of outlets shall be at the discretion of the contractor, so as to provide a functional facility. The location of the outlets will also be shown on the shop drawings.

Installed electrical appliances, including the process monitoring equipment, shall be rugged, high quality items that meet appropriate National Standards. A description of their specifications, including the name of the manufacturer, model number and reference to certification with National Standards, shall be included in the bidding package for all installed electrical appliances.

Spare Parts: An initial set of spare parts, filter and testing equipment will be acquired to allow each system to operate for approximately 30 days before additional operating stocks are required.

Item: 2000 Kg per day solid waste incinerator
Total Number for each Accommodation Module: 1
Total Number to be Acquired: 4

Item: 30 day package of spare and operating stock
Total Number for each Accommodation Module: 1
Total Number to be Acquired: 4

Please note that actual quantities to be included in the Invitation for Bid (IFB) may vary slightly from those specified in this announcement.
  
BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the IFB has been issued.

Personnel working on this project, or visiting installations and/or working at NATO sites, are required to have a NATO SECRET security clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a Declaration of Eligibility from the U.S. Department of Commerce: 18 October 2007

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: not before 22 October 2007

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD. The bids received in response to the IFB will be valid for a period of 180 days.

4. Anticipated contract award date: TBD. Delivery 9 months after contract award.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for One (1) LWIR (long wavelength infrared region) camera system to support upcoming experimental research investigations.  The camera will be coupled to a data system capable of near-continuous acquisition, storage and processing of 640 x 512-pixel formatted IR images collected at multiple-present integration times at high frame rates.  NASA/ARC intends to purchase the SC6000 QWIP/HSDR LWIR camera system from FLIR Systems Inc. The LWIR camera system that FLIR manufactures will integrate seamlessly into the existing programs used by NASA. No other product was found that met the specifications of camera interface or support by FLIR Systems' ThermaCAM RTools and ThermaCAM Researcher software in use at NASA ARC. Using other sources that do not meet the requirement will have an adverse effect on NASA engineers to effectively deploy a working camera system for specialized tests taking place in the near future. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 8, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

September, 30, 2009 Type of Purchase Order:		Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) Estimated Level of Effort:	213 Hours for Tasks 1-7  (50 Hours for Optional Tasks 8-9) INTRODUCTION The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As a part of this process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of  Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the Criteria Air Pollutants in an Integrated Science Assessment (ISA), historically known as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is now in the process of reviewing the NAAQS for particulate matter  (PM).  The last review of the PM NAAQS was completed in 2006.  At that time, the EPA lowered the level of the 24-hour PM2.5 standard from 65 ?g/m3 to 35 ?g/m3, and retained the current annual fine particle standard of 15 ?g/m3.  The Agency also retained the existing national 24-hour PM10 standard  of 150 ?g/m3, while revoking the annual PM10 standard.  The Agency is now initiating the next review of these standards.  The current review of the NAAQS for PM is targeted for completion in October 2011, to meet the five year-interval requirement for review of the criteria and NAAQS for PM (as  described in the Clean Air Act, section 109(d)(1)).  As one of the first steps in the review process, the first external draft of the PM ISA is targeted for release in August 2008 for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) and the public at a public meeting to be held in  autumn 2008.  The EPA?s proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for the second draft and final PM ISA. The scientific information on PM shall be evaluated, integrated and synthesized in an Integrated Science Assessment and its annexes.  Initial draft materials for the ISA and  annexes will be reviewed at a peer review workshop sponsored by the EPA.  These initial draft materials for the ISA will be written prior to the peer review meeting using discipline-specific (i.e., epidemiology, toxicology, controlled human exposures, etc.) findings from each respective section and  integrating them into a concise document.  Following this meeting, the ISA will be revised based on author and peer reviewer comments, resulting in an external review draft which will be released for public comment and CASAC review.  The EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the PM ISA for public  and CASAC review prior to the completion of the final PM ISA.   Under this order, as outlined in the tasks described in the statement of work, the EPA seeks the professional services of an expert scientist(s) to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary, and integration of the available  scientific database on human health risks from PM exposure.  In particular, assisting in the preparation of the PM ISA sections related to human clinical studies (controlled human exposures). TASKS The Contractor shall accomplish the following tasks and shall complete these tasks according to the  estimated deliverable schedule below.  Because of the importance of these tasks to EPA?s mandated environmental objectives, any late deliverables may negatively affect the outcome of the entire project.         TASK 1.	Submit an Expanded Section Outline and Joint Quality Management/Quality  Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP) 		The Contractor shall submit a Joint Quality Management/Quality Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP) for the product specified in Task 3 within 10 days of award of the order (see Attachment 1 for an outline of the plan).  The JQM/QAPP shall address issues of quality  assurance and control procedures and issues of the use of secondary data to produce the deliverables specified in Task 3.  The JQM/QAPP must be approved by the EPA Technical Project Officer (PO) within 7 days of receipt. 		In addition to the JQM/QAPP, the Contractor shall submit to the EPA PO an  expanded section outline within 10 days of award of the purchase order.  The expanded outline shall provide a clear presentation of the scientific issues (see Attachment 2) and identify some preliminary key studies to be discussed in the controlled human exposures/clinical studies section of the PM  ISA.  The intent of the outline is to ensure that the Contractor has a clear understanding of the specified technical direction and guidelines for the completion of this section. TASK 2.	Participate in Preliminary Meeting for Authors 		NCEA shall hold a teleconference to assess the current  understanding of PM and the expanded outline provided by the Contractor (Task 1).  This meeting will provide an opportunity to discuss the content and organization of the document as appropriate, and to clarify the requirements in the Statement of Work.  Potential participants will include NCEA  staff and authors or contributors who may participate in the development of the PM ISA.  This teleconference is intended to provide the Contractor with important scientific guidance in fulfilling the tasks and responsibilities outlined in the Statement of Work, and to raise and address issues of  importance in assessing human health effects of PM exposure, specifically within the context of human clinical studies (see Attachment 2).  It will also provide the Contractor with a clear understanding of the nature and schedule of the PM ISA preparation.  The meeting is tentatively scheduled to  take place in November, 2007.  The Contractors shall be notified by the PO of the exact date of the meeting within two weeks of the award. TASK 3.	Prepare Written Section(s) for the ISA Relevant to Health Effects in Response to Controlled Human Exposures 		The Contractor shall prepare a text  section for the PM ISA that concisely reviews the most relevant scientific literature related to health effects following controlled human exposures to PM.  This will include a brief review of the controlled human exposure studies described in the 2004 Air Quality Criteria Document for Particulate  Matter and the 2006 Provisional Assessment of Recent Studies on Particulate Matter, as well as a comprehensive review of all new studies not included in either of these two documents (a sample outline is presented in Attachment 2).  In addition to the text section, the Contractor shall prepare  tables that summarize all newly published studies on the assigned topic. 	In order to successfully complete Task 3, the Contractor shall perform the following subtasks. Subtasks (1)	The Contractor shall present a brief summary of the state of knowledge concerning the evidence from controlled  human exposures on the toxicological effects of PM at the time of the writing of the 2004 PM AQCD and the 2006 Provisional Assessment of Recent Studies on PM.  Key conclusions shall be presented, which will frame the discussion of new studies and issues.   (2)	The Contractor shall perform a  comprehensive and detailed literature search of all new peer-reviewed articles, books, and reports, either published or accepted for publication, that present relevant health effects data and information from controlled human exposures to PM that were not included in the previous PM AQCD.  The  Contractor shall provide information on QA procedures used to conduct the comprehensive literature search, including keywords, specific databases and search engines used, and limits placed on the searches.  The basis used for selecting controlled human exposure literature for the present assessment  include whether a given study reports sufficient information on:  Particle type and collection or generation method  Analyses of effects of specific types of PM or indicators related to PM sources (e.g., diesel exhaust, concentrated ambient particles, wood smoke, etc.) and/or size fractions  PM  exposure concentration  Exposure duration  Exposure system (i.e., exposure chamber, bronchial instillation, etc.) Analytical and statistical methods Using these criteria, the Contractor shall document reasons for which potentially relevant studies have been omitted from inclusion in the human  clinical section. (3)	For each study identified from Task 3, Subtask 2, the Contractor shall evaluate and consider: PM sources, components, or other characteristics that may be responsible for the observed health outcomes Method(s)/instrument(s) used to characterize PM properties If the measured  health endpoints were meaningful If the analyses used were appropriate and properly performed and interpreted If study design limitations were acknowledged If the reported findings were internally consistent, biologically plausible, and coherent with other known facts and/or studies In addition,  for each study the Contractor shall document available human subject ethics information, which may include information on informed consent, institution review approval, and ethics standards under which the study was conducted.  (4)	The Contractor shall prepare tables describing the newly published  studies, which shall include for each study: Number, age and health status of subjects tested within each gender Particle type, size, component, source, and origin Method(s)/instrument(s) used to characterize PM properties Exposure concentration and duration Exposure protocol (e.g., intermittent  exercise, co-exposures, etc.) Principal study findings along with study strengths and weaknesses (5)	The Contractor shall perform a balanced and objective evaluation that summarizes, interprets, and synthesizes the most important studies in the controlled human exposure literature on the health  effects of PM.  This shall include an integrated discussion of data from new studies, as well as studies that have been described in the previous PM AQCD.  To the extent possible, the review shall include a comparison of study results with different PM components or sources, as well as a discussion  of possible mechanisms and pathways responsible for the observed health effect.  In addition to the written text, the results and conclusions of the studies shall be presented in quantitative summary tables and figures as appropriate. As part of this subtask, the Contractor shall summarize and  integrate the literature in a manner that addresses the issues that have been identified and revised throughout the process of development of the document.  For the health effects reviewed, the Contractor shall provide a clinical and public health perspective and identify new issues and literature  as appropriate.  The Contractor shall develop this work product to aid in the development of the ISA, a concise and focused assessment that addresses the issues identified and provides the framework for the PM NAAQS.  The Contractor shall also provide EPA with a copy of all journal articles  referenced and include a thorough bibliography of references.        TASK 4.	Review and Evaluate the Preliminary Draft of the Health Effects Chapter of the PM ISA and Attend the Peer Review Workshop to Discuss the Draft 	A preliminary draft of the health effects chapter of the PM ISA will be  developed by the EPA using the drafts of the authors? sections from the various health disciplines (e.g., human clinical, epidemiology, toxicology, etc.).  The Contractor shall review and provide written comments on this entire chapter prior to the peer review workshop.  The draft chapter will be  provided to the Contractor by the PO two weeks in advance of the event.    	The Contractor shall attend the peer review workshop which will be convened to review the draft section(s) and preliminary health effects chapter of the ISA to ensure that issues pertinent to review of the PM NAAQS have  been adequately addressed, and that all relevant, new literature has been identified.  The Contractor shall be present to discuss his/her specific draft section of the PM ISA, as well as to provide input on other related draft sections.  This workshop is expected to take place over a two day period  in April 2008. TASK 5.	Revise Draft Section of PM ISA in Response to Comments Received at the Peer Review Workshop 	The Contractor shall prepare any revisions on his/her draft sections based on recommendations from the peer review workshop.  A post-meeting written response to comments shall be  delivered to the EPA PO two weeks after the workshop. 	Upon receipt of the revised drafts, the EPA will process the various sections to produce a unified word processed draft version of the PM ISA that includes text, figures, tables, and references.  In so doing, the EPA will first examine the  text for quality control, both technical and editorial, and implement appropriate revisions.  The EPA will then integrate the material across the various sections and chapters of the document, and will interpret the overall available information.  The Contractor shall be available to assist in the  development and synthesis of the ISA.  The EPA will assume primary authorship of the ISA in this process.  Contributing authors are listed in the final document as appropriate. TASK 6.	Prepare First External Review Draft of PM ISA 	EPA will process the various PM sections and complete the  development of the external review draft ISA.  The Contractor shall be available to assist in the development and synthesis of the ISA.  This draft will be submitted to CASAC and the public for review. TASK 7.	Attend and Participate in the CASAC Review Meeting and Respond to Public Comments 	The  Contractor shall attend and participate in the public meeting conducted by CASAC that will review the first external draft of the ISA for PM.  In particular, the Contractor shall be prepared to both participate in the discussion of his/her section as well as provide preliminary oral responses to  public comments.  These comments will be provided to the Contractor as available before the CASAC public meeting.  The CASAC public meeting will be held in Research Triangle Park, NC over a 2-3 day period.  The Contractor shall be notified of the exact schedule at least 30 days in advance of the  meeting by a letter from the EPA PO.       OPTIONAL TASKS The Government may elect to exercise one or both of the optional tasks listed below (Tasks 8 and 9).  The Contractor shall not perform any work associated with these optional tasks until a written confirmation is received from the EPA  Contracting Officer (CO) stating that one or both of the optional tasks has been authorized and funded accordingly. NOTE: The specific requirements for the optional task(s), if exercised, shall be provided to the Contractor by the EPA CO in the Contract modification, along with the dates for  completion.              TASK 8.	Revise Chapter/Section for the EPA?s Second External Review Draft Document 	The Contractor shall be responsible for preparing written comments in response to any public or CASAC review comments received in his/her draft sections of the document.  Revisions shall  be made to the Contractor?s draft sections in response to CASAC and public comments, and shall reflect relevant new information published in the peer-reviewed literature since the completion of the first external review draft.  Considerable effort will be made to incorporate and synthesize the most  current published and peer-reviewed scientific information into the document.  The Contractor shall revise the draft section(s) to be consistent with the ISA.

STATEMENT OF WORK 	NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES I.     Project Identification:   Consultation for Air Quality Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (PM) ? Toxicologic Studies of PM Immune and Allergic Effects II.    Period of Performance:  Date of Award ? September 30, 2009 III.  Type of Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs and  fees) IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:   247 hours for Tasks 1?7 (120 hours for Optional Task 8?10) INTRODUCTION 	The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) review and integrate new scientific information on the pollutant in an Integrated Science Assessment (ISA), historically known as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). 	The EPA is now in the process of  reviewing the NAAQS for particulate matter (PM).  The last review of the PM NAAQS was completed in 2006 (71 FR 61144, October 17, 2006).  At that time, the EPA lowered the level of the 24-hour PM2.5 standard from 65 ?g/m3 to 35 ?g/m3, and retained the current annual fine particle standard at 15  ?g/m3. The Agency also retained the existing national 24-hour PM10 standard of 150 ?g/m3, while revoking the annual standard for PM10. The Agency is now initiating the next review of these standards. 	The current review of the NAAQS for PM is targeted for completion in October 2011, to meet the  five year-interval requirement for review of the criteria and NAAQS for PM (as described in the Clean Air Act, section 109(d)(1)).  As one of the first steps in the review process, the first external draft of the PM ISA is targeted for release in August 2008 for review by the Clean Air Scientific  Advisory Committee (CASAC) and the public at a meeting in Fall 2008.  The EPA?s proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for the second draft and final PM ISA. 	The scientific information on PM shall be evaluated, integrated and synthesized in an Integrated Science Assessment and  its annexes.  Initial draft materials for the ISA and annexes will be reviewed at a peer review workshop sponsored by the EPA.  These initial draft materials for the ISA will be written prior to the peer review meeting by using discipline-specific (i.e., epidemiology, toxicology, etc.) findings  from each respective section and integrating them into a concise document.  Following this meeting, the ISA will be revised based on author and peer reviewer comments, resulting in release of an external review draft for public comment and CASAC review.  The EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of  the PM ISA for public and CASAC review, before completion of the final PM ISA. 	 NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation, summary, and integration of the available scientific database on PM health effects.  Under this order,  the EPA seeks the professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing PM immune and allergic effects in laboratory animals, cell culture, and assay systems. TASKS 	The Contractor shall accomplish the following  tasks and shall complete these tasks according to the estimated deliverable schedule below.  Because of the importance of these tasks to the EPA?s mandated environmental objectives, any late deliverables may negatively affect the outcome of the entire project. Task 1.  	SUBMIT AN EXPANDED  SECTION OUTLINE AND JOINT QUALITY MANAGEMENT/QUALITY ASSURANCE PROJECT PLAN (JQM/QAPP) 	The Contractor shall submit a Joint Quality Management/Quality Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP) for the product specified in Task 3, within 10 days of award of the order (see Attachment 1 for an outline of the  plan).  The JQM/QAPP shall address issues of quality assurance and control procedures and issues of the use of secondary data to produce the deliverables specified in Task 3.  The JQM/QAPP will be reviewed by the EPA Project Officer (PO) and the Quality Assurance Manager within 7 days of  receipt. 	In addition to the JQM/QAPP, the Contractor shall submit to the EPA PO an expanded section outline within 10 days of award of an order.  The expanded outline shall provide a clear presentation of the scientific issues (see Attachments 2 and 3) and identify some preliminary key studies to  be discussed in the immunotoxicology and allergy section of the ISA and annexes.  The intent of the outline is to ensure that the Contractor has a clear understanding of the specified technical direction and guidelines for completion of this section. Task 2.	PARTICIPATE IN PRELIMINARY MEETING FOR  AUTHORS 	The EPA PO will hold a teleconference to assess the current understanding of PM and the expanded outline provided by the Contractor (Task 1).  The Contractor shall participate in the teleconference.  This meeting will be an opportunity for interaction among authors and EPA in the initial  stages to develop the content and organization of the document as appropriate, and to clarify the requirements in the Statement of Work.  Potential participants will include NCEA staff, authors, and contributors who may participate in the development of the PM ISA and annexes.  The meeting is  intended to provide the Contractor with important scientific guidance in fulfilling their respective responsibilities/tasks and to raise and address issues (see Attachments 2 and 3) of importance in assessing the immune and allergic effects resulting from PM exposure.  It will also provide  Contractors with a clear understanding of the nature and time schedule of the PM ISA preparation.  The meeting is tentatively scheduled to take place within 2 weeks after award.  The Contractor shall be notified of the exact date of the meeting within a few days after award by the PO. Task  3.	PREPARE WRITTEN SECTIONS ON THE TOXICOLOGY STUDIES RELEVANT TO THE IMMUNE AND ALLERGIC EFFECTS OF PM FOR THE ISA 	The Contractor shall prepare a text section (document) for the PM ISA that concisely reviews the most relevant published scientific evidence on the immune and allergic/adjuvancy  effects of PM.  The Contractor shall address the issues outlined in Attachment 2, based on literature available since completion of the previous PM AQCD.  In addition to the text section, the Contractor shall prepare tables that summarize all newly published studies on the assigned topic only if  Task 8 (listed below) is exercised.  A proposed outline of all the general topics in the annex on toxicologic effects of PM exposure is included in Attachment 3.   	In order to successfully complete Task 3, the Contractor shall perform the following subtasks. Subtasks 	The Contractor shall  present a brief summary of the state of knowledge concerning PM effects on allergy and the immune system at the time of the writing of the 2004 PM AQCD and the 2006 Provisional Assessment of Recent Studies on PM.  Key conclusions forming the basis for current criteria shall be presented and  established for framing the discussion of new studies and issues. 	The Contractor shall perform a detailed  literature survey of all new peer-reviewed, published (or accepted for publication) articles, books, and reports that present data and information on PM immune and allergic effects that were  not included in the previous PM AQCD.  The Contractor shall provide information on QA procedures used to conduct the comprehensive literature search, including keywords, type of search engines, and limits placed on the searches.  The basis used for selecting immune and allergic literature for the  present assessment includes whether a given study includes sufficient information on:   particle type and collection or generation method; analyses of effects of specific PM or indicators related to PM sources (e.g., combustion-related particles) and/or size fractions;  PM dose/concentration  levels;  exposure method and system (i.e., whole-body inhalation, cell culture, etc.);  exposure duration; and  analysis methods. 	If any of the above are insufficiently characterized in the manuscript, such that making appropriate conclusions is difficult, that study should not be further  considered for the integration and synthesis portion of this Task (Subtask 4).  The Contractor shall fully document the study selection criteria for inclusion and provide explanations as to why a study has been omitted from the PM ISA animal immunotoxicology and allergy section (i.e., how it  ?failed? the selection criteria). 	The Contractor shall determine the relative quality of PM immune and allergic studies identified in Task 3, Subtask 2.  Emphasis shall be placed on the PM immune and allergic studies published since the previous PM AQCD that evaluate the (1) effects of PM at  doses or concentrations that are reasonable compared to ambient levels (<20 times the highest ambient concentrations observed), (2) potential mechanisms of immune and allergic effects, and/or (3) PM sources, components, or other characteristics that may be responsible for these immune and allergic  effects.  Those studies employing granular dusts (e.g., carbon black, titanium dioxide, etc.) or minerals (e.g., quartz, feldspar, mylonite, etc.) should be included only for comparison purposes, as these particle types are often laboratory derived and/or found in trace quantities in ambient PM.   In addition, those studies employing only gaseous components of diesel exhaust (e.g., 2-nitrobenzanthrone, benzo(a)pyrene, nitrophenols, etc) will be excluded.  Studies that include these compounds as part of an ambient PM mixture should be included.  Studies that utilize man-made nanoparticles  should also be excluded.  The following considerations shall be taken into account for each identified study:  If the immune and allergic function and endpoint measurements were meaningful and reliable. If the methods and analyses employed were appropriate, well performed and properly  interpreted. If important study design limitations were appropriately controlled or acknowledged. If the reported findings were internally consistent, biologically plausible, and coherent with other known facts and/or studies. 	The Contractor shall perform a balanced and objective evaluation that  summarizes, interprets, and synthesizes the most important studies and issues in the toxicologic literature on immune and allergic effects of PM.  As appropriate, older studies (i.e., those published prior to the last PM ACQD) may be referenced and cited to support new study findings.  To the  extent possible, this review should expand upon the allergic host discussion in the 2004 AQCD for PM and bring forward new study results with different PM components or sources.  For PM components and sources that have numerous studies (e.g., diesel emissions and fractions), only those studies  providing the strongest evidence shall be discussed, with other studies providing complementary and supplementary information.  The Contractor shall rely upon his or her expertise in the immunotoxicology and allergy fields to determine the most appropriate studies for discussion.  Those studies  included in the discussion shall be described in the context of their findings and how they relate to the five bulleted points below; specific details on the methodology of these studies shall only be included when necessary (i.e., novel animal model, significant limitations, etc.).  However, these  study details may be included in a summary table or figure.  Newly created or appended previously published tables and figures will be utilized in the discussion.  The Contractor shall present observations and conclusions for immune and allergic PM findings (including adjuvancy effects).  The  following points shall be discussed in the synthesis text: integration of new PM immune and allergy literature; interpretation of immune and allergic results in the context of previous PM documents and literature; possible mechanisms and pathways responsible for the observed immune and allergic  effects; coherence of immune and allergic effects across similar particle types, components, and/or sizes; and consistency of immune and allergic effects across in vivo and in vitro study types. 	As part of this subtask, the Contractor shall summarize and integrate the literature in a manner  that addresses the issues that have been identified and revised throughout the process of development of the document. For the health effects reviewed, the Contractor shall provide a public health perspective and identify new issues and literature as appropriate.  The Contractor shall provide EPA  with a copy of all journal articles referenced and include a thorough bibliography of references. Task 4.	REVIEW AND EVALUATE THE PM ISA AND ATTEND THE PEER REVIEW WORKSHOP FOR THE DRAFT 	The first draft of the PM ISA shall be reviewed by all authors, external peer reviewers, and relevant NCEA  staff at the peer review workshop.  A workshop will be held to discuss reviewer comments. Subtasks  (1)	The Contractor shall review and provide written comments on the health material relevant to his/her toxicological discipline of the review draft.  A draft of the relevant section(s) will be  provided to the Contractor by the PO two weeks in advance of the event. (2)	The Contractor shall attend the peer review workshop to discuss his/her specific draft section(s) of the PM ISA.  The workshop is expected to take place in March/April 2008 and to last approximately two days.  The  Contractor shall be present during the period that covers review of the areas of the ISA for which their active participation is needed.  The workshop will be convened to review the draft ISA to ensure that issues pertinent to review of the PM NAAQS are brought into the ISA and that all relevant,  new literature has been identified. 	An advance notice of the specific dates for the peer review workshop will be provided to the Contractor by a written notification issued by the EPA PO and copied to the EPA Contracting Officer (CO), 30 days in advance of the event. Task 5.	REVISE THE  SECTIONS IN RESPONSE TO COMMENTS RECEIVED AT THE PEER REVIEW WORKSHOP			 	The Contractor shall submit any revisions on his/her section(s) based on recommendations resulting from the peer review workshop.  A post-meeting written response to comments shall be delivered to the EPA PO two weeks after  the workshop.    	Upon receipt of author inputs, the EPA will process the various sections to produce a unified word processed version that includes text, figures, tables, and references.  On the technical aspects, the EPA first examines the text for quality control and implements appropriate  revisions and then integrates the material across section, chapter and document, including interpreting the overall available information.  The EPA thus assumes primary authorship in this process.  Contributing authors are listed in the final document as appropriate. Task 6.	PREPARE FIRST EXTERNAL  REVIEW DRAFT OF PM ISA 	EPA will process the various PM sections and complete the development of the draft ISA. The Contractor shall be available to assist in the development and synthesis of the ISA.  This draft ISA will be submitted to CASAC and the public for review. Task 7.	ATTEND AND  PARTICIPATE IN THE CASAC REVIEW MEETING AND RESPOND TO PUBLIC COMMENTS 	In preparation for the CASAC review meeting, the Contractor shall be prepared to participate in the discussion on the contents of the document.  In particular, the Contractor shall be prepared to participate in the discussion  on his/her section.  The Contractor shall also read any public comments received on this section that are supplied by the EPA PO and shall be prepared to provide a preliminary oral response to those comments.  Comments will be provided to the Contractor as available before the CASAC public meeting.  	The Contractor shall attend and participate in the public meeting conducted by the CASAC that will review the first external draft of Integrated Science Assessment for PM.  The CASAC public meeting will be held in Research Triangle Park, NC, and is expected to last approximately 2?3 days.  The  Contractor shall be notified of the exact schedule for the meeting by a letter from the EPA PO, at least 30 days in advance. OPTIONAL TASKS 	The Government may elect to exercise one or more of the optional tasks listed below.  The Contractor shall not perform any work associated with the  optional tasks below (Tasks 8, 9 or 10) until a written modification is received from the EPA CO stating that one or more of the optional tasks has been exercised and funded accordingly.  Optional tasks will be exercised on as needed basis.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive  proposals.     However,     interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requiring by submitting documentation, to Thomas Martinez at the office identified above, by e-mail (martinez.thomas@epa.gov) , which establishes that their specifications meet EPA's  requirement.     Documentation must be     received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by EPA.     A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

As part of this process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) review and integrate new scientific information on the pollutant in an Integrated Science Assessment (ISA), historically known as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). 	The EPA is now in the process of reviewing the  NAAQS for particulate matter (PM).  The last review of the PM NAAQS was completed in 2006 (71 FR 61144, October 17, 2006).  At that time, the EPA lowered the level of the 24-hour PM2.5 standard from 65 ?g/m3 to 35 ?g/m3, and retained the current annual fine particle standard at 15 ?g/m3. The Agency  also retained the existing national 24-hour PM10 standard of 150 ?g/m3, while revoking the annual standard for PM10. The Agency is now initiating the next review of these standards. 	The current review of the NAAQS for PM is targeted for completion in October 2011, to meet the five year-interval  requirement for review of the criteria and NAAQS for PM (as described in the Clean Air Act, section 109(d)(1)).  As one of the first steps in the review process, the first external draft of the PM ISA is targeted for release in August 2008 for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee  (CASAC) and the public at a meeting in Fall 2008.  The EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for the second draft and final PM ISA. 	The scientific information on PM shall be evaluated, integrated and synthesized in an Integrated Science Assessment and its annexes.  Initial  draft materials for the ISA and annexes will be reviewed at a peer review workshop sponsored by the EPA.  These initial draft materials for the ISA will be written prior to the peer review meeting by using discipline-specific (i.e., epidemiology, toxicology, etc.) findings from each respective  section and integrating them into a concise document.  Following this meeting, the ISA will be revised based on author and peer reviewer comments, resulting in release of an external review draft for public comment and CASAC review.  The EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the PM ISA for public  and CASAC review, before completion of the final PM ISA. 	 NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation, summary, and integration of the available scientific database on PM health effects.  Under this order, the EPA seeks the  professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing PM cardiovascular effects in laboratory animals, cell culture, and assay systems. TASKS 	The Contractor shall accomplish the following tasks and shall complete  these tasks according to the estimated deliverable schedule below.  Because of the importance of these tasks to the EPA's mandated environmental objectives, any late deliverables may negatively affect the outcome of the entire project. Task 1.  	SUBMIT AN EXPANDED SECTION OUTLINE AND JOINT  QUALITY MANAGEMENT/QUALITY ASSURANCE PROJECT PLAN (JQM/QAPP) 	The Contractor shall submit a Joint Quality Management/Quality Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP) for the product specified in Task 3, within 10 days of award of the order (see Attachment 1 for an outline of the plan).  The JQM/QAPP  shall address issues of quality assurance and control procedures and issues of the use of secondary data to produce the deliverables specified in Task 3.  The JQM/QAPP will be reviewed by the EPA Project Officer (PO) and the Quality Assurance Manager within 7 days of receipt. 	In addition to the  JQM/QAPP, the Contractor shall submit to the EPA PO an expanded section outline within 10 days of award of an order.  The expanded outline shall provide a clear presentation of the scientific issues (see Attachments 2 and 3) and identify some preliminary key studies to be discussed in the  cardiovascular toxicology section of the ISA and annexes.  The intent of the outline is to ensure that the Contractor has a clear understanding of the specified technical direction and guidelines for completion of this section. Task 2.	PARTICIPATE IN PRELIMINARY MEETING FOR AUTHORS 	The EPA PO  will hold a teleconference to assess the current understanding of PM and the expanded outline provided by the Contractor (Task 1).  The Contractor shall participate in the teleconference.  This meeting will be an opportunity for interaction among authors and EPA in the initial stages to develop the  content and organization of the document as appropriate, and to clarify the requirements in the Statement of Work.  Potential participants will include NCEA staff, authors, and contributors who may participate in the development of the PM ISA and annexes.  The meeting is intended to provide the  Contractor with important scientific guidance in fulfilling their respective responsibilities/tasks and to raise and address issues (see Attachments 2 and 3) of importance in assessing the cardiovascular toxicology of PM exposure.  It will also provide Contractors with a clear understanding of the  nature and time schedule of the PM ISA preparation.  The meeting is tentatively scheduled to take place within 2 weeks after award.  The Contractor shall be notified of the exact date of the meeting within a few days after award by the PO. Task 3.	PREPARE WRITTEN SECTIONS ON THE TOXICOLOGY STUDIES  RELEVANT TO THE CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF PM FOR THE ISA 	The Contractor shall prepare a text section (document) for the PM ISA that concisely reviews the most relevant published scientific evidence on the cardiovascular effects of PM.  The Contractor shall address the issues outlined in  Attachment 2, based on literature available since completion of the previous PM AQCD.  In addition to the text section, the Contractor shall prepare tables that summarize all newly published studies on the assigned topic only if Task 8 (listed below) is exercised.  A proposed outline of all the  general topics in the annex on toxicologic effects of PM exposure is included in Attachment 3.   	In order to successfully complete Task 3, the Contractor shall perform the following subtasks. Subtasks (1)	The Contractor shall present a brief summary of the state of knowledge concerning PM  effects on the cardiovascular system at the time of the writing of the 2004 PM AQCD and the 2006 Provisional Assessment of Recent Studies on PM. Key conclusions forming the basis for current criteria shall be presented and established for framing the discussion of new studies and issues. (2)	The  Contractor shall perform a detailed  literature survey of all new peer-reviewed, published (or accepted for publication) articles, books, and reports that present data and information on PM cardiovascular effects that were not included in the previous PM AQCD.  The Contractor shall provide  information on QA procedures used to conduct the comprehensive literature search, including keywords, type of search engines, and limits placed on the searches.  The basis used for selecting cardiovascular literature for the present assessment includes whether a given study includes sufficient  information on:   "	particle type and collection or generation method; "	analyses of effects of specific PM or indicators related to PM sources (e.g., combustion-related particles) and/or size fractions;  "	PM dose/concentration levels;  "	exposure method and system (i.e., whole-body inhalation,  cell culture, etc.);  "	exposure duration; and  "	analysis methods. 	If any of the above are insufficiently characterized in the manuscript, such that making appropriate conclusions is difficult, that study should not be further considered for the integration and synthesis portion of this Task  (Subtask 4).  The Contractor shall fully document the study selection criteria for inclusion and provide explanations as to why a study has been omitted from the PM ISA animal toxicological cardiovascular section (i.e., how it "failed" the selection criteria). (3)	The Contractor shall determine  the relative quality of PM cardiovascular studies identified in Task 3, Subtask 2.  Emphasis shall be placed on the PM cardiovascular studies published since the previous PM AQCD that evaluate the (1) effects of PM at doses or concentrations that are reasonable compared to ambient levels (<20 times  the highest ambient concentrations observed), (2) potential mechanisms of cardiovascular effects, and/or (3) PM sources, components, or other characteristics that may be responsible for these cardiovascular effects.  Those studies employing granular dusts (e.g., carbon black, titanium dioxide,  etc.) or minerals (e.g., quartz, feldspar, mylonite, etc.) should be included only for comparison purposes, as these particle types are often laboratory derived and/or found in trace quantities in ambient PM.  In addition, those studies employing only gaseous components of diesel exhaust (e.g.,  2-nitrobenzanthrone, benzo(a)pyrene, nitrophenols, etc) will be excluded.  Studies that include these compounds as part of an ambient PM mixture should be included.  Studies that utilize man-made nanoparticles should also be excluded.  The following considerations shall be taken into account for  each identified study:  "	If the cardiovascular parameter and endpoint measurements were meaningful and reliable. "	If the methods and analyses employed were appropriate, well performed and properly interpreted. "	If important study design limitations were appropriately controlled or  acknowledged. "	If the reported findings were internally consistent, biologically plausible, and coherent with other known facts and/or studies. (4)	The Contractor shall perform a balanced and objective evaluation that summarizes, interprets, and synthesizes the most important studies and issues  in the toxicologic literature on cardiovascular effects of PM.  As appropriate, older studies (i.e., those published prior to the last PM ACQD) may be referenced and cited to support new study findings.  To the extent possible, this review should expand upon the cardiovascular toxicology discussion  in the 2004 AQCD for PM and bring forward new study results with different PM components or sources.  For PM components and sources that have numerous studies (e.g., diesel emissions and fractions), only those studies providing the strongest evidence shall be discussed, with other studies providing  complementary and supplementary information.  The Contractor shall rely upon his or her expertise in the cardiovascular field to determine the most appropriate studies for discussion.  Those studies included in the discussion shall be described in the context of their findings and how they relate  to the five bulleted points below; specific details on the methodology of these studies shall only be included when necessary (i.e., novel animal model, significant limitations, etc.).  However, these study details may be included in a summary table or figure.  Newly created or appended previously  published tables and figures will be utilized in the discussion.  The Contractor shall present observations and conclusions for cardiovascular PM findings.  The following points shall be discussed in the synthesis text: "	integration of new PM cardiovascular literature; "	interpretation of  cardiovascular results in the context of previous PM documents and literature; "	possible mechanisms and pathways responsible for the observed cardiovascular effects; "	coherence of cardiovascular effects across similar particle types, components, and/or sizes; and "	consistency of cardiovascular  effects across in vivo and in vitro study types. 	As part of this subtask, the Contractor shall summarize and integrate the literature in a manner that addresses the issues that have been identified and revised throughout the process of development of the document. For the health effects  reviewed, the Contractor shall provide a public health perspective and identify new issues and literature as appropriate.  The Contractor shall develop this work product for the ISA annex to form the basis for the development of the ISA, a concise focused assessment that addresses the issues  identified and provides the foundation for the PM NAAQS. 	The Contractor shall provide EPA with a copy of all journal articles referenced and include a thorough bibliography of references. Task 4.	REVIEW AND EVALUATE THE PM ISA AND ATTEND THE PEER REVIEW WORKSHOP FOR THE DRAFT 	The first draft of  the PM ISA shall be reviewed by all authors, external peer reviewers, and relevant NCEA staff at the peer review workshop.  A workshop will be held to discuss reviewer comments. Subtasks  (1)	The Contractor shall review and provide written comments on the health material relevant to his/her  toxicological discipline of the review draft.  A draft of the relevant section(s) will be provided to the Contractor by the PO two weeks in advance of the event. (2)	The Contractor shall attend the peer review workshop to discuss his/her specific draft section(s) of the PM ISA.  The workshop is  expected to take place in March/April 2008 and to last approximately two days.  The Contractor shall be present during the period that covers review of the areas of the ISA for which their active participation is needed.  The workshop will be convened to review the draft ISA to ensure that issues  pertinent to review of the PM NAAQS are brought into the ISA and that all relevant, new literature has been identified. 	An advance notice of the specific dates for the peer review workshop will be provided to the Contractor by a written notification issued by the EPA PO and copied to the EPA  Contracting Officer (CO), 30 days in advance of the event. Task 5.	REVISE THE SECTIONS IN RESPONSE TO COMMENTS RECEIVED AT THE PEER REVIEW WORKSHOP			 	The Contractor shall submit any revisions on his/her section(s) based on recommendations resulting from the peer review workshop.  A  post-meeting written response to comments shall be delivered to the EPA PO two weeks after the workshop.    	Upon receipt of author inputs, the EPA will process the various sections to produce a unified word processed version that includes text, figures, tables, and references.  On the technical  aspects, the EPA first examines the text for quality control and implements appropriate revisions and then integrates the material across section, chapter and document, including interpreting the overall available information.  The EPA thus assumes primary authorship in this process.  Contributing  authors are listed in the final document as appropriate. Task 6.	PREPARE FIRST EXTERNAL REVIEW DRAFT OF PM ISA 	EPA will process the various PM sections and complete the development of the draft ISA. The Contractor shall be available to assist in the development and synthesis of the ISA.  This  draft ISA will be submitted to CASAC and the public for review. Task 7.	ATTEND AND PARTICIPATE IN THE CASAC REVIEW MEETING AND RESPOND TO PUBLIC COMMENTS 	In preparation for the CASAC review meeting, the Contractor shall be prepared to participate in the discussion on the contents of the  document.  In particular, the Contractor shall be prepared to participate in the discussion on his/her section.  The Contractor shall also read any public comments received on this section that are supplied by the EPA PO and shall be prepared to provide a preliminary oral response to those  comments.  Comments will be provided to the Contractor as available before the CASAC public meeting.  	The Contractor shall attend and participate in the public meeting conducted by the CASAC that will review the first external draft of Integrated Science Assessment for PM.  The CASAC public  meeting will be held in Research Triangle Park, NC, and is expected to last approximately 2-3 days.  The Contractor shall be notified of the exact schedule for the meeting by a letter from the EPA PO, at least 30 days in advance. OPTIONAL TASKS 	The Government may elect to exercise one or more  of the optional tasks listed below.  The Contractor shall not perform any work associated with the optional tasks below (Tasks 8, 9 or 10) until a written modification is received from the EPA CO stating that one or more of the optional tasks has been exercised and funded accordingly.  Optional  tasks will be exercised on as needed basis. Task 8. 	PREPARE ANNEX TABLES FOR PEER REVIEW MEETING AND REVISE PM ANNEX TABLES IN RESPONSE TO COMMENTS RECEIVED FROM PEER REVIEW MEETING  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     However,     interested parties may identify  their interest and capability to respond to the requiring by submitting documentation, to Thomas Martinez at the office identified above, by e-mail (martinez.thomas@epa.gov) , which establishes that their specifications meet EPA's requirement.

A post-meeting written response to comments shall be delivered to the EPA PO two weeks after the workshop.    	Upon receipt of author inputs, the EPA will process and revise the various sections to produce a unified word processed version that includes  text, figures, tables, and references.  On the technical aspects, the EPA first examines the text for quality control and implements appropriate revisions and then integrates the material across section, chapter and document, including interpreting the overall available information.  The EPA thus  assumes primary authorship in this process.  Contributing authors are listed in the final document as appropriate.   Task 6.	PREPARE FIRST EXTERNAL REVIEW DRAFT OF PM ISA 	EPA will process the various PM sections and complete the development of the draft ISA. The Contractor shall be available to  assist in the development and synthesis of the ISA.  This draft ISA will be submitted to CASAC and the public for review. Task 7.

<DESC>This is a request for quotation (RFQ) under subject reference number.  The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW/A7KS), on behalf of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), intends to purchase hardware and software upgrades, maintenance and technical support to AFOSI Records Repository?s existing Ribstone Scanning System, located in Waldorf, MD.  Justification for the brand name is supported because this is an essential upgrade to existing hardware/software.  The continued use of this proven scanning system is critical to the records management of law enforcement case files and evidence for the Air Force.  Technically, and considering cost, it is most effective to obtain these upgrades rather than to have the hardware, software, maintenance and technical support developed and provided by another source.  SEE ATTACHMENT FOR THE REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT.  NAIC is 541512 with a size standard of $23M.  Vendors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration. Please include vendor cage code, DUNS, tax ID, business size and POC information.  Closing date for quotations is 8:00 AM Eastern-Standard time on 29 Sep 07.  Award of this action will take place NLT 30 Sep 07.  E-mail and fax submissions (301-981-3168) are acceptable.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Contracting Center of Excellence intends to negotiate a sole source award with:  ICF Consulting Services LLC, 9300 Lee Hwy, Fairfax, VA 22031-6050,  to provide continuation of workforce assessment that will identify areas for improvement.  There are three (3) Tiers.   Tier one.  Review of statistical data, military and civilian, currently contained in seven separate data bases, accessible by the Army Diversity Office (ADO) Tier two.  Examination of the Armys policies to identify structural barrie rs that limits or tends to limits the employment or career progression of certain groups.  Tier three. Analysis of existing employee satisfaction surveys and diversity climate surveys given by Department of Army, Defense Equal Opportunity Management Instit ute (DEOMI), and Office Personnel Management (OPM) as well as feedback from employee focus groups. The proposed phase two ADO workforce assessment is a three tier process  (statistical, policy, climate analysis) structured to link  to the Army Diversity Goals.  This is a follow on effort to set up and institutionalize a diversity program for the Army.  The Government stands a high risk of increased contractual costs due to the uniqueness of the vendors proven methodology and increased time to complete the HQDA workforce diversity assessment.  The detrimental impact of starting from scratch on this acti on would set the Army back about a year and would incur costs and overruns that are unforeseen. The statutory authority permitting this award under Other Than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See Note 22.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Award is anticipated no later than 28 September 2007.  The point of contact is Faatalivale Teo-Lewis, Contract Specialist, e-mail: faatalivale.teolewis@hqda.army.mil

_____________________________________________________

The Federal Acquisition Service of the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement a Local Services Acquisition (LSA) for Telecommunications Services.  The Government will award a series of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with a base period of three years and four (4) twelve month option periods.  Firm Fixed Price task orders will be issued under the resultant IDIQ contract.  The Government plans to award multiple LSA contracts in the states of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware.  These contracts will be for the use of all Federal agencies, authorized Federal contractors, agency-sponsored universities and laboratories and, as authorized by law or regulation, state, local, and tribal Governments, and other organizations.  The Government has defined three service groups: Voice Services (VS), Data Transmission Services (DTS) and Internet Access Services (IAS), along with the labor and material necessary to connect these services to customer premises equipment (CPE).  Offerors must propose mandatory voice services to be eligible for an award.

The Government desires to make multiple awards for LSA services but reserves the right to limit the number of awards.  Contracts will be awarded to Offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the Government.  The actual number of contracts awarded will be determined by the Government and based on technical acceptability and price evaluation of mandatory LSA services.  The following Technical factors will be considered: Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Management Approach.  The Technical Factors of Technical Approach and Past Performance will be approximately equal in weight and each will be greater in weight than the Management Approach factor.  The combined weight of all technical evaluation factors will be approximately equal to the Price Factor of Total Evaluated Discounted Cost.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used as set forth in FAR Part 15.  Offerors are advised that an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; and to award contracts to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total evaluated discounted cost.  Therefore, proposals should be initially submitted on the most favorable terms.

The Request for Proposal (RFP), consisting of the solicitation and all attachments will be issued and posted electronically on the www.fedbizoppps.gov website.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Kristin L. Markiewicz, GSA Contract Specialist, at Kristin.Markiewicz@gsa.gov.  This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAICS Code 517110.  The solicitation should be available on or about 07/23/2007.  Potential offerors should be advised that the date of a pre-proposal conference will be announced at the same time as the issuance of the RFP and is estimated to be conducted approximately two weeks after the official RFP is posted.

Sources Sought Synopsis announcements are issued to assist the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in performing market research to determine industry interest and capability, obtain company demographics, benchmarking information and industry ideas for an acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is not a request for proposal and at this time, no solicitation exists.

Introduction:  The Agency's mission is to safeguard the United States and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate and counter the threat and its effects.  This mission dictates a diverse set of customers and unique mission requirements.  The Agency's Information Technology (IT) requirements are therefore equally diverse and unique.  DTRA is seeking interested sources capable of providing integrated IT services and support for the DTRA IT environment. 

Background:  The DTRA Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for ensuring that IT capabilities are acquired and information resources are managed and maintained in a manner that supports the Agency's mission consistent with Federal and Department of Defense guidance.  This entails developing, maintaining, and operating an integrated set of IT capabilities, services and processes across all functional areas of the Agency.  IT support requirements within DTRA are extremely diverse, ranging from office automation and business/mission system support to sensor integration.  

In the past, the broad range and diversity of the Agency IT support requirements, in addition to other factors, led to a "stovepiped" and fractured IT infrastructure.  The CIO, teamed with the DTRA IT support contractor(s), is committed to developing the necessary governance, processes and oversight required to effectively integrate IT services across the Agency.

DTRA recently consolidated the majority of its personnel and IT infrastructure within the Defense Threat Reduction Center (DTRC) located at Fort Belvoir, VA.  The current infrastructure provides IT services and support for over 2400 employees and contractors.  In addition to the DTRC facility, IT services are provided to several smaller field offices in the National Capitol region, eight Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) remote sites within the U.S., the DTRA Albuquerque office and four overseas offices.

The DTRA IT infrastructure encompasses three principal security domains: Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU), Secret, and Top Secret/ Sensitive Compartmental Information (TS/SCI).  In addition, the CIO supports numerous mission and business systems in addition to collaboration capabilities.

Requirements:   DTRA intends to acquire services and support for its IT environment from a contractor(s).  The Agency requires the provider(s) to integrate the current IT environment into a centrally managed enterprise system capable of providing 24/7/365 IT functional support to all DTRA facilities, both CONUS and OCONUS along with providing built-in capabilities to address future enhancement, modernization and technology changes.  Potential sources will be required to satisfy organizational conflict of interest requirements.

The following provides a list of IT services and support that DTRA seeks to obtain.  These services will be performed to support all of the Agency's developmental, operational, and business system networks at all classification levels from Unclassified to TS/SCI.

Sources must possess "core competencies" in the area of IT Infrastructure/Services/Systems Integration support.  Sources must demonstrate experience and ability to provide an adequate number of cleared personnel (up to and including TS/SCI) and IA certified personnel at both CONUS and OCONUS locations.

<DESC>Correction - the intent of the Modification posted on September 26, 2007 was to announce the performance decision.  The correct information is below.

In accordance with OMB Circular A-76 (Revised May 29, 2003), the U.S. Department of Education (ED) announces a performance decision for the Call Center and Training Services for EDCAPS Applications A-76 Streamlined Competition, which was announced in FedBizOpps on June 29, 2007 under Reference Number PA-OCFO2007.  The Department calculated, compared, and certified on the A-76 Streamlined Competition Form the costs of the function based on the scope and requirements of the activity to determine if government personnel should perform the activity.  On September 26, 2007, the Streamlined Competition Form was certified.  The estimated cost of agency performance exceeds the estimated cost of private sector performance.  The performance decision favors private sector performance of the function.  The official end date of the Standard Competition is September 26, 2007.  THIS A-76 PERFORMANCE DECISION PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT IS NEITHER A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE NOR A SOLICITATION.

<DESC>The current woodland Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) is used by the AF as a working & field uniform.  The Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) is replacing the BDU.  The lighter color way of the ABU camouflage print (AFDTS) will not hide many potential stains.  Air Force Clothing Office (AFCO) compiled data on stains that are of the biggest concern.  As a result AFCO is seeking information regarding industry available, stain repel-and-release finishes.  This is not a solicitation, and no award will be made for this effort at this time.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  The Government holds the right to test any of the fabrics.  All submissions must be Berry Amendment compliant.  Proposed solutions shall be currently available technologies.  New technologies shall be compatible with all salient characteristics and testing requirements of the base cloth as specified in the purchase description (PD) YACL-05-1 CLOTH TWILL AIR FORCE DIGITAL TIGER STRIPE PRINT CAMOUFLAGE PATTERN, 25 July 2005, plus amendments.

FUNCTIONAL CONCERNS
	Types of stains encountered by the Airmen have a correlation to their functional daily tasks & responsibilities.  In Maintenance functions typical stain types include engine exhaust soot, tire break grime, fuel, deicing fluid, hydraulic fuel, mineral vegetable and ester based oils, and liquid oxygen.  In Field use Airmen reported blood, grass stains, dirt stain, red clay, flare (orange/red), and muddy water as typical.  General staining in everyday ?life? tasks such as eating and drinking are tomato, coffee, soda and juices.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
	AF requests testing results for each product.  For required tests please reference PD and amendments listed above.  Other requirements include effectiveness after exposure to high temperatures in theater, and under rigorous laundering conditions.  Finish should not cause changes in shade, or spectral values a result of application.  Use of Nano technology and other state of the art technologies encouraged.  Any available Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) sheets should also be forwarded.  Since this product will come in close proximity to the skin while in use, proof is required that no potential health issues are posed by the proposed remedy.
	If this fabrication is currently in use please note current applicable industry or military end uses as well as any known positive or negative feedback from current end uses. 
	The USAF would like to keep all current processing the same for the ABU, so that the only changing variable is the addition of stain assistance technology.  This means that we will continue to use the garment dipped process.  As there is some processing that occurs in garment form, this should be taken into consideration when implementing new processes to ensure overall compatibility.  The salient testing characteristics that currently stand should not be reduced by the addition of the new stain process.  We encourage industry partnerships.  If a copy of the cloth or the end item purchase descriptions are needed please e-mail request. 

If needed, request material(s) from a licensed vendor.

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA/GSFC to post a Request for Information and Propellant Tank specification and statement of work via the internet, and solicit responses from interested parties.  This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirements, as well as promote competition. NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Spacecraft Propellant Tank.  The GPM Core Spacecraft Propulsion Subsystem will use a single propellant tank that will hold high purity hydrazine monopropellant.  The tank will have an expulsion device, either a surface tension propellant management device or a positive expulsion device to ensure gas free propellant delivery during the mission.  The propellant tank requirements are described in detail in specification GPM 422-06-01-11-002. The effort to be performed to meet the requirements of the specification are described in detail in the statement of work GPM 422-06-01-11-003.  The propellant tank shall have a flight-qualified capacity of 725 kg of hydrazine (550kg of hydrazine for blow-down operation with a MDP of 400 psia and EOL pressure of 100 psia).	The propellant tank shall be designed to enable the gas free expulsion of propellant over the s/c level accelerations (including directions, magnitudes, and durations) and thruster operation requirements specified in GPM-422-06-01-11-002.  The propellant tank shall have an expulsion efficiency of greater than 99% of the maximum load capacity.	The tank shall be designed to demise and thus is baselined as a carbon epoxy COPV with all aluminum liner and PMD.

<SUBJECT>D -- Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source
<DESC>This is a notice of intent by Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to award a sole source contract to National Law Enforcement Telecommunications Systems Inc, (NLETS) 2930 Camel Back Road #160, Phoenix, AZ 85016-4497. The period of performance will for one base year and 4 option years.

	FMCSA requires real-time, consolidated access to a variety of state-exclusive security databases.  FMCSA, in turn, intends to make such security information available to its investigative personnel on a progressively expanding basis.   

Specifically, NLETS provides unique, single-point-of-entry access to international criminal justice data resources, and represents a potential, critical support tool in FMCSA's ability to conduct both safety and security enforcement activities at the roadside and in motor carriers' respective places of business.  Drawing upon its many database records, NLETS would first provide FMCSA's Emergency Response and Security Section with immediate access to law enforcement information desperately needed for FMCSA to meet its Homeland Security requirements, and will soon thereafter also provide other designated FMCSA personnel (on a rolling basis) with direct, real-time access to various driver license, driver history and criminal history information, any one of which could prove vital in distinguishing simple safety violations from potential national security threats.  The contemplated contract will be firm fixed-price.

This award will be made in accordance with FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements as a follow on to an existing contract.  The services are highly specialized and it is likely that an award to any other source would result in duplication of cost to the government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement.

2.	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED

DRS SCANNING DIGITIZER SYSTEM AND OLIVE SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE

3.	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY?S NEEDS / ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE

The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) requires a maintenance contract to continue the maintenance of the DRS system and the Olive software that is intrinsic to the DRS system.  The DRS scanning digitizer system enables the DTIC to automatically scan up to 200 microfiche without operator intervention.  The Olive software is customized software for the DRS machines that is responsible for reading the header information of DTIC?s microfiche in order to properly perform the indexing function of the converted microfiche.  The DTIC requires the following to be accomplished by the maintenance contract:

A.	Continued Support of the DRS Scanning Digitizer as an IT Solution to Digitize the DTIC?s Microfiche Collection.  DTIC has standardized on a single integrated technology platform consisting of the DRS scanning digitizer system that allows for the successful development and deployment of a more robust, and scalable microfiche digitizing management system, while Olive software's XML DISTILLER platform dramatically reduces microfiche to XML production and maintenance costs of the content.  The DTIC has two DRS systems that must be maintained.

Current DRS System Must Continue to Save Searches.  The maintenance provided must ensure the users can continue to save and share their searches with other users. A saved search can be viewed according to the reports that were present in the system when the search was created, according to the reports that are currently in the system, or according to the reports that have been added or changed since the search was created.

	B.	Continued Support of the Olive Software intrinsic to the DRS System.  The current Olive Software system provides an automated process for the indexing of DTIC?s microfiche using the unique XML Distiller intelligent content transformation capabilities specifically customized to recognize the header information of each microfiche.  The document structure is recognized and abstracts are automatically synthesized from existing DTIC reports based on key information contained in the scanned reports.  All microfiche are converted into a unified PrXML, TIFF and PDF format ensuring preservation of the original format and long-term archiving.  Olive XML Distiller technology is based on an advanced parallel image processing architecture that ensures ultra accuracy and hi-speed microfiche image processing and AI (artificial Intelligence) technology for intelligent XML transformation.  DTIC has two copies of the Olive Software that must be supported.

C.	Continued Support of the DRS Scanning Digitizer as an IT Solution to Digitize the DTIC?s Microfiche Collection.  The DTIC has two DRS systems that must be maintained consisting of the following equipment:

Currently the extruded diet we produce consists of the following ingredients: agar, sugar, soy flour, wheat germ, yeast and water. Moisture content is about 60% of the weight of the finished product. Four liquid ingredients are dispensed into the extruder: water, corn oil, acetic acid and vitamin solution dissolved in water.  Current production rate using the 80 mm TSE is 695 kg/hr operating at 325 rpm/hr and has residence time of 55 seconds.  (xii) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  The Twin Screw Extruder and its components must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable:  The extruder must be new equipment, used equipment is not acceptable. The equipment shall have at least a one year warranty.  It shall have  34-40 mm barrel diameter with a length to diameter ratio of 35:1.  The barrels shall be lined with hardened nitrided steel.  The barrels may be closed barrel type or clam-shell design. The machine must have an electrical heating system with a heating element in each zone of the barrel  capable of achieving heating temperatures of 170 degrees Celsius. The machine must be capable of cooking and extruding diets consisting of the following mixture: agar, sugar, soy flour, wheat germ, yeast, water, corn oil, acetic acid and vitamin solution dissolved in water. It shall have a programmable logic control (PLC) operating system. The PLC system may be a stand alone or integrated unit.  Due to room configuration and space limitations,  if the PLC is an integrated unit, it shall be located on the right hand side of the front of the machine (the end opposite from the discharge). It must have internal cooling system ports capable of accepting a mixture of water and glycol up to 50% glycol.  The main drive motor must have electrical specifications of 480V, 3 phase, 60Hz, with the power produced sized appropriately to the extruder diameter and in the range of 50-80 HP at the machine's top RPM rating. The main drive motor must also be capable of operating the TSE in the desired range of RPM for our extrusion process of 200-850 RPM.  The machine requires ports for liquid injectors or thermocouples to measure product temperature in each machine zone.  Zone 1 (one)  is required to have two separate ports.  The die head at each discharge of each screw end must consist of a one (1) inch diameter female national pipe thread standard (NPT).  The die head is to be fitted with a port to measure barrel pressure and a pressure transducer shall be provided to monitor die head pressure, this will be capable of integration to the PLC.  Thermocouples will be provided for temperature control or for monitoring product temperature shall be provided for each zone of the barrel, these shall be capable for integration to the PLC.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

Notice to Offerors:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  

Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) at Orlando, FL intends to procure on a sole source basis the DARWARS Ambush! Training System with BBN Technologies at Cambridge, MA.

 This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.)  BBN Technologies is the original developer of the Ambush! modification to a commercial gaming engine and holds all of the current developmental tools, licenses and agreements with the game and model developers (intellectual property and software licensing) necessary to complete the model development within the projected schedule.   

The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price contract to make software changes and transition technical support of the DARWARS Ambush! training system.  DARWARS Ambush! is a commercial game based technology that was modified under a Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program and recently transitioned to PEO STRI for continuing development and sustainment.  Ambush! training is being used daily at over 200 locations by units in preparation for and during deployments in support of the Global War on Terror.  The new contract will continue development of new vehicle models to replicate Rapid Equipping Force and Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Office (JIEDDO) and Air Force Protection Battle Lab initiatives that are already being used in the field.  

For further information regarding this procurement action call the Contract Specialist, Vicky Wei at 407-384-5389.  Responses may be made by email to: guo.wei1@peostri.army.mil.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO. 04 - THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO PROVIDE RESPONSES TO QUESTION SUBMITTED BY OFFEROR

Question:  In considering a decision to bid on this work, I would like to know whether it is open to the actual vendor of the design, Westinghouse, or whether they are precluded because of a conflict of interest. In this regard, I would appreciate any related clarification of Conflict of Interest requirements for this solicitation.


NRCs Response:  This is a full and open competition which restricts no firm from proposing on the training requirement for AP 1000.  The course material is publicly available information and is not proprietary technology.  

Please refer to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Acquisition Regulation (NRCAR) Subpart 2009.5 on Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI).  

The clause below is hereby incorporated into the terms and conditions of this combined synopsis/solicitation:

2052.209-72 CONTRACTOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
(JAN 1993)
 
   (a)  Purpose.  The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that the contractor:
 
     (1)  Is not placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to the work under this contract; and
 
     (2)  Does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.
 
   (b)  Scope.  The restrictions described apply to performance or participation by the contractor, as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2 in the activities covered by this clause.
 
   (c)  Work for others.
 
     (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, during the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to forego entering into consulting or other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with respect to the work being performed under this contract.  The contractor shall ensure that all employees under this contract abide by the provision of this clause.  If the contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any employee, that any proposed consultant or other contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall obtain the written approval of the contracting officer before the execution of such contractual arrangement.
 
     (2)  The contractor may not represent, assist, or otherwise support an NRC licensee or applicant undergoing an NRC audit, inspection, or review where the activities that are the subject of the audit, inspection, or review are the same as or substantially similar to the services within the scope of this contract (or task order as appropriate) except where the NRC licensee or applicant requires the contractor's support to explain or defend the contractor's prior work for the utility or other entity which NRC questions.
 
     (3)  When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, the contractor shall neither solicit nor perform work in the same or similar technical area for that licensee or applicant organization for a period commencing with the award of the task order or beginning of work on the site (if not a task order contract) and ending one year after completion of all work under the associated task order, or last time at the site (if not a task order contract).
 
     (4)  When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site,
 
       (i)  The contractor may not solicit work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate.
 
       (ii)  The contractor may not perform work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate, and for one year thereafter.
 
       (iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contracting officer may authorize the contractor to solicit or perform this type of work (except work in the same or similar technical area) if the contracting officer determines that the situation will not pose a potential for technical bias or unfair competitive advantage.
 
   (d)  Disclosure after award.
 
     (1)  The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in this contract, that it does not have any organizational conflicts of interest as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2.
 
     (2)  The contractor agrees that if, after award, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer.  This statement must include a description of the action which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts.  The NRC may, however, terminate the contract if termination is in the best interest of the Government.
 
     (3)  It is recognized that the scope of work of a task-order-type contract necessarily encompasses a broad spectrum of activities.  Consequently, if this is a task-order-type contract, the contractor agrees that it will disclose all proposed new work involving NRC licensees or applicants which comes within the scope of work of the underlying contract.  Further, if this contract involves work at a licensee or applicant site, the contractor agrees to exercise diligence to discover and disclose any new work at that licensee or applicant site.  This disclosure must be made before the submission of a bid or proposal to the utility or other regulated entity and must be received by the NRC at least 15 days before the proposed award date in any event, unless a written justification demonstrating urgency and due diligence to discover and disclose is provided by the contractor and approved by the contracting officer.  The disclosure must include the statement of work, the dollar value of the proposed contract, and any other documents that are needed to fully describe the proposed work for the regulated utility or other regulated entity.  NRC may deny approval of the disclosed work only when the NRC has issued a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or has plans to issue a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or when the work violates paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section.
 
   (e)  Access to and use of information.
 
     (1)  If in the performance of this contract, the contractor obtains access to information, such as NRC plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), the contractor agrees not to:
 
       (i)  Use this information for any private purpose until the information has been released to the public;
 
       (ii)  Compete for work for the Commission based on the information for a period of six months after either the completion of this contract or the release of the information to the public, whichever is first;
 
       (iii)  Submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government based on the information until one year after the release of the information to the public; or
 
       (iv)  Release the information without prior written approval by the contracting officer unless the information has previously been released to the public by the NRC.
 
     (2)  In addition, the contractor agrees that, to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information under this contract, the contractor sha

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of F5 Big IP Premium Level Maintenance for Big 1000 and 2400RCU.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/II owns and has in use F5 Networks Big IP is hardware that provides high-availability load balancing, fast and extremely intelligent layer 7 switching, granular interactive control, DoS protection, resource pooling and a number of other features to help protect our Internet presence with  the following features: •	Reliability - Delivers the industry's most proven and advanced system to ensure that applications are always available.  •	Accelerated Applications - Provides control to accelerate application performance by up to 3-times, ensures that priority applications are served first, and offloads expensive server cycles.   •	Reduced Server and Bandwidth Costs - Triples server capacity through a set of infrastructure optimization capabilities; reduces bandwidth costs by up to 80% through intelligent HTTP compression, bandwidth management and more.  •	Greater Network and Application Security - From DoS protection to cloaking to filtering out application attacks, BIG-IP adds critical security features that cannot be addressed elsewhere in the network.  •	Application Intelligence and Control - The industry's only solution which delivers complete application fluency - enabling network-speed full payload inspection and programmable event-based traffic management to understand and act upon application flows.  •	Total Integration for All IP Applications -- Provides a comprehensive solution that can integrate with all applications, not just Web based protocols.  Provides organizations with a centralized solution for all IP applications, including legacy and emerging applications like VOIP -- all in a single unified system.  •	Industry Leading Performance - Delivers the fastest traffic management solution to secure, deliver and optimize application performance. Offers best-in-market SSL TPS, bulk encryption, and the highest concurrent SSL connections available today. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue to maintain F5 Big IP hardware.<BR><BR>The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Due to CA’s investment and overall satisfaction with this hardware, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install other hardware at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the F5 Big IP hardware.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Government’s best overall interests to procure and use this particular maintenance<BR><BR>

Deliverables and acceptance of the deliverables for the Twin Screw Extruder machine will be FOB destination USDA, APHIS, CPHST, 3645 E. Wier Avenue, Phoenix, AZ  85040. (x) The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE for this contract is from date of award through delivery of all the equipment. (xi) OBJECTIVES: The configuration we are requesting is patterned after the current configuration we use for an 80 mm TSE for production of PBW diet but we plan on having an adaptable TSE for use for other insect diets.   Currently the extruded diet we produce consists of the following ingredients: agar, sugar, soy flour, wheat germ, yeast and water. Moisture content is about 60% of the weight of the finished product. Four liquid ingredients are dispensed into the extruder: water, corn oil, acetic acid and vitamin solution dissolved in water.  Current production rate using the 80 mm TSE is 695 kg/hr operating at 325 rpm/hr and has residence time of 55 seconds.  (xii) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  The Twin Screw Extruder and its components must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable:  The extruder must be new equipment, used equipment is not acceptable. The equipment shall have at least a one year warranty.  It shall have  34-40 mm barrel diameter with a length to diameter ratio of 35:1.  The barrels shall be lined with hardened nitrided steel.  The barrels may be closed barrel type or clam-shell design. The machine must have an electrical heating system with a heating element in each zone of the barrel  capable of achieving heating temperatures of 170 degrees Celsius. The machine must be capable of cooking and extruding diets consisting of the following mixture: agar, sugar, soy flour, wheat germ, yeast, water, corn oil, acetic acid and vitamin solution dissolved in water. It shall have a programmable logic control (PLC) operating system. The PLC system may be a stand alone or integrated unit.  Due to room configuration and space limitations,  if the PLC is an integrated unit, it shall be located on the right hand side of the front of the machine (the end opposite from the discharge). It must have internal cooling system ports capable of accepting a mixture of water and glycol up to 50% glycol.  The main drive motor must have electrical specifications of 480V, 3 phase, 60Hz, with the power produced sized appropriately to the extruder diameter and in the range of 50-80 HP at the machine's top RPM rating. The main drive motor must also be capable of operating the TSE in the desired range of RPM for our extrusion process of 200-850 RPM.  The machine requires ports for liquid injectors or thermocouples to measure product temperature in each machine zone.  Zone 1 (one)  is required to have two separate ports.  The die head at each discharge of each screw end must consist of a one (1) inch diameter female national pipe thread standard (NPT).  The die head is to be fitted with a port to measure barrel pressure and a pressure transducer shall be provided to monitor die head pressure, this will be capable of integration to the PLC.  Thermocouples will be provided for temperature control or for monitoring product temperature shall be provided for each zone of the barrel, these shall be capable for integration to the PLC. The machine must include a complete set of screws meeting the requirement of having a total set length of 35 diameter for each shaft along with spares (10%) to cover breakage and to ensure there are replacement parts so as not to hamper production.  The final screw set configuration will be determined in consultation between USDA and the contractor.  The configuration for our current 80 mm TSE is described below as a guide to help specify our requirements:    

Extruder hardware  Length (D)	Number (N)(2 x 35 D for both shafts) needed + replacement extras:
Forward Screw	    1 (D)       40 (N)
Paddle	            0.25(D)     76 (N)

Short pitch feed screw	1(D)	 2(N)
Single lead	    1(D)	 8(N)
End Cap	    0.25 (D)     2(N)
		 
 

THE WEIGHT LOSS FEEDER must have a maximum dry-feed rate of 60 kg/hr and a 4 cubic foot hopper with cover, configured for attachment and integrated operation with the specified TSE and  the PLC; have product contact parts of stainless steel; have one screw set with electro-polish screw finish with either concave or full flight profile in long or short pitch (The final configuration of the screw set will be determined in consultation between USDA and the contractor.);  2 blade horizontal agitation,  a feeder mounting stand; a feeder drive motor with 450 W, 100 VDC, and IP65 enclosure; a motor controller (NEMA 4) mounted on the feeder with communication connection for integration and programming with the PLC to start, stop, monitor and record feed rates in both real time and for storage of feed rate data.

In order to make the final determinations of the screw sets described above, the USDA may need to send a sample of the diet ingredients to be tested or send a representative to test the diet on the contractor's demonstration equipment. If this becomes necessary the USDA understands their may be an additional charge, however, the contractor shall confirm they have this capability.  If there is an additional charge for this service the contractor should indicate the applicable charge.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

DFAS has invested a considerable amount of time and money into the design, and subsequent purchase of the listed equipment in order to meet the storage requirements necessary to stay in compliance with DoD directives.  NETTAPP, ADIC Storage system with VERITAS software were first installed at DFAS in 2005.  Total acquisition costs for these storage systems since 2005 is over $9,000,000.00.  The Governments requirement is for technical support of storage products, as required to comply with warranty provisions of the hardware and software. Maintenance representatives must be authorized by NETTAPP in order to service the equipment currently under warranty without violating the terms of the warranty.

Consequently, this acquisition is for the renewal of software/hardware maintenance previously purchased, implemented, and currently being used by all DFAS users, is considered to be a logical follow-on in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)2 (ii).

Amended to post Vendor question(s) and Agency answer(s) to the solicitation.

Question: What I would like to know is if we can submit a bid directly, or we have to work with another party who will subcontract us to do the work.  We are not a small business.  

Answer: The Agency cannot inform you how to submit a proposal, that is entirely up to you on how you would like to compete for the service.  The size standard is based on the Small Business Administration North American Industry Classification System Codes and required for the type of services requested, as is, the statement that all responsible offerors may submit bids.

Quotations should meet all instructions put forth in this combine synopsis/solicitation. PLEASE REVIEW THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AND RESUBMIT YOUR PROPOSAL IF NECESSARY:

FIRST SET:

1.	May we substitute a different brand of projector? The Mitsubishi company owns NEC also and they have projectors that have twice the number of inputs with the same performance specs and are a thousand less. We have even had good performance with the Optoma brand. If this is unacceptable, would you please let me know the Mitsubishi model number of preference? One thing to check however, the projector needs a DVI input. They don?t have them until the models get into the commercial grade units.

Yes.  A different brand of projector may be used as long as it meets the standards as expressed in the original statement of work. The projectors are commonly used for power point presentations in the rooms and the main considerations are clarity and brightness, not brand.

2.	Please clarify if 2 VHS players are desired as in the quote? I would suggest we go to a single DVD / VHS combo player that has recordable DVD. They are only around 200 dollars. 

Either  a single VHS player or a DVD/VHS combination player would meet our needs.    

3.	What is the ceiling type? I assumed tile. It makes a difference on the type of mount to use. 

The ceiling type is a dropped grid type with lift out tiles.

4.	What is the ceiling height? Determines if we have to use an extension. 

HQ Location:		8?
Columbus Location:		9?
New Cumberland Location:	10?	



5.	Can we substitute the AMX volume control by integrating a different product that controls volume, scales video from all sources to DVI and performs all A/V switching? It is a fraction of the other cost. The AMX will still control volume, it just won?t need a separate module. 

Yes.  

6.	Why do we have a projector and Two monitors? I understand a monitor and a projector. Does each display need to be capable of showing a different source simultaneously? Just an understanding of location and function would help. 
We want the option to display to either the projector the monitor.  The projectors are to replace old existing units. The actual monitors are to be wall mounted. One monitor in the New Cumberland and Columbus locations and two will be located in the HQ location.  


7.	Where is the rack supposed to go? By calculation the rack needs to be at least 27U. Where you trying to integrate into the podium or is there space for it in the room?

We would like to place any rack which contains the controls, additional equipment etc. within the conference room itself.   It can be a standalone rack and does not need to integrate with a podium.  We would like it to be functional first, but as aesthetically pleasing as possible.

8.	What needs to be interfaced into the conference table through the ?furnishings? ? (HDMI, DVI, VGA, Component Video, S-Video, RCA audio, 3.5mm audio, USB cable and network ports, these are common, some have less) 

The only items we have planned to have on the conference table itself are cordless microphones used during the VTC.

9.	What is the floor made of underneath the conference table? If it is concrete then to get the cables to the table it will require core drillers. Not hard but just an additional cost.

The floors within each room are concrete. Core drilling may not be an option as, specifically in the Columbus and HQ areas, there is no access to the space below the floor. Cordless equipment is the preferred method for items placed on the conference room table.

10.	What is the purpose of having the vendor provide the Network Switch? Can it be a different Vendor? A managed switch from other than AMX can be 1/5th of the cost. How do you foresee the switch utilized in the conference room? 

We were assuming that inclusion of a network switch would provide additional flexibility as far as media used and points connected. It can be other than AMX. 

11.	The government supplied computer needs to have a dual output DVI ?d Video Card. This will be the need for any solution that wasn?t designed 4 years ago. Performance is significantly better and creates a uniform Video standard in the system. Not to mention HDTV capable. Do we need to include a different Video Card in the quote. (Most DOIM type IT guys won?t let an outside vendor in their machines for security reasons) 

Once we have the specs and requirements we will request that our IT shop outfit the computer as required. 

12.	Please clarify the ?Installation Kit? that is identified in the Video system, Monitor system and in the Rack system? In the video system I am assuming the projector mount. Monitor I am unclear unless the intention is to permanently mount to some surface. For the rack system I am assuming the accessories such as drawers, shelfs, lights and fan kits?? 

?Installation kit? was terminology used in earlier DLA projects for the components.  We intend to wall mount the monitors.  We simply mean all the parts to set up and install the rack system and other compenents needed in support of the VTC.

13.	Last but not least, did you ever consider a smartboard? They are such an asset and could really make this room valuable. I would recommend a 16X9 aspect ratio with 94? diagonal. Again, it replaces your screen, whiteboard and the need to be at the computer to control a presentation. The screen becomes a touchscreen. Even if done later, the system is designed to seamless add this technology and any other foreseeable so there isn?t a mentality of if you don?t do it now you are lost but it will greatly increase the value of the system. Having the Electronic Whiteboard work in conjunction with the Polycom product is amazing and therefore allows white board collaboration with any other VTC session.

The HQs location expressed a desire for this equipment after we put together the statement of work so we will be pursuing it after the vtc is installed.   New Cumberland does have a smart board but we did not integrate it into the vtc in the sow.  
 

SECOND SET:


1.	Projector (Mitsubishi); There are may versions, can you provide model number

Our requirement is for a current model projector with a minimum of 3000 lumens that will integrate with the other items in the requirement.

2.	VCR ? can you provide model number

Any current model VCR that will integrate with the other items in the requirement.

3.	,Installation Kit ? unsure what this refers to can you be specific

Our earlier installations used the terminology to describe the equipment needed to mount the monitors, speakers, cameras, projector, and rack assembly.  No specific requirements from here. 


4.	Matrix Switch ? there are many type fo swiches, Altinex Extron Auto patch and many configurations composite video S-Video BNC 8x4 8x8 16x16 etc can you provide model number or part number

Any current model that meets or exceeds the requirements and that will integrate with the other items in the requirement.


5.	VCR ? is this a typo or do you need two VCR?sor should it be a DVD/VCR combo player

Basic requirement is for a single VCR at each location, but a combination DVD/VCR would work fine also.


6.	Amplifier, how many channels 2 how many watts
7.	
Not specified.  We expect good quality sound for a medium sized conference room as stated.

8.	Mixer ? what size 4 or 8 channel, provide model number( eg Polycom Vortex 2280
Not specified.  We expect good quality sound for a medium sized conference room as stated.


9.	Speakers ? How many what Type Ceiling or wall, eg JBL 26CT
Brand not specified.  Drop ceiling with removable grid.  Number not specified. 


10.	What type of mics are you using, the Polycom mics or other , ceiling or table top push to talk, How many?

Wireless microphones.  Brand to be specified by vendor based on requirements.  Table top and hand held. 

11.	Video Conferencing Equipment (Polycom):     Which Polycom System VSX5000, 7000s,7000e, 8000 or HDX9001,9002 or 9004 
Whatever model meets our requirements at the best value to the government. 



12.	integration,tilt/pan camera ? How many cameras, are they Polycom cameras or Sony or Canon
Brand not specified.  Two cameras.  


13.	Base system, software -Polycom Options ? multipoint 4 or 6 way calling,;

Quotations should meet all instructions put forth in this combine synopsis/solicitation. PLEASE REVIEW THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AND RESUBMIT YOUR PROPOSAL IF NECESSARY:

FIRST SET:


1.	May we substitute a different brand of projector? The Mitsubishi company owns NEC also and they have projectors that have twice the number of inputs with the same performance specs and are a thousand less. We have even had good performance with the Optoma brand. If this is unacceptable, would you please let me know the Mitsubishi model number of preference? One thing to check however, the projector needs a DVI input. They don?t have them until the models get into the commercial grade units.

Yes.  A different brand of projector may be used as long as it meets the standards as expressed in the original statement of work. The projectors are commonly used for power point presentations in the rooms and the main considerations are clarity and brightness, not brand.

2.	Please clarify if 2 VHS players are desired as in the quote? I would suggest we go to a single DVD / VHS combo player that has recordable DVD. They are only around 200 dollars. 

Either  a single VHS player or a DVD/VHS combination player would meet our needs.    

3.	What is the ceiling type? I assumed tile. It makes a difference on the type of mount to use. 

The ceiling type is a dropped grid type with lift out tiles.

4.	What is the ceiling height? Determines if we have to use an extension. 

HQ Location:		8?
Columbus Location:		9?
New Cumberland Location:	10?	



5.	Can we substitute the AMX volume control by integrating a different product that controls volume, scales video from all sources to DVI and performs all A/V switching? It is a fraction of the other cost. The AMX will still control volume, it just won?t need a separate module. 

Yes.  

6.	Why do we have a projector and Two monitors? I understand a monitor and a projector. Does each display need to be capable of showing a different source simultaneously? Just an understanding of location and function would help. 
We want the option to display to either the projector the monitor.  The projectors are to replace old existing units. The actual monitors are to be wall mounted. One monitor in the New Cumberland and Columbus locations and two will be located in the HQ location.  


7.	Where is the rack supposed to go? By calculation the rack needs to be at least 27U. Where you trying to integrate into the podium or is there space for it in the room?

We would like to place any rack which contains the controls, additional equipment etc. within the conference room itself.   It can be a standalone rack and does not need to integrate with a podium.  We would like it to be functional first, but as aesthetically pleasing as possible.

8.	What needs to be interfaced into the conference table through the ?furnishings? ? (HDMI, DVI, VGA, Component Video, S-Video, RCA audio, 3.5mm audio, USB cable and network ports, these are common, some have less) 

The only items we have planned to have on the conference table itself are cordless microphones used during the VTC.

9.	What is the floor made of underneath the conference table? If it is concrete then to get the cables to the table it will require core drillers. Not hard but just an additional cost.

The floors within each room are concrete. Core drilling may not be an option as, specifically in the Columbus and HQ areas, there is no access to the space below the floor. Cordless equipment is the preferred method for items placed on the conference room table.

10.	What is the purpose of having the vendor provide the Network Switch? Can it be a different Vendor? A managed switch from other than AMX can be 1/5th of the cost. How do you foresee the switch utilized in the conference room? 

We were assuming that inclusion of a network switch would provide additional flexibility as far as media used and points connected. It can be other than AMX. 

11.	The government supplied computer needs to have a dual output DVI ?d Video Card. This will be the need for any solution that wasn?t designed 4 years ago. Performance is significantly better and creates a uniform Video standard in the system. Not to mention HDTV capable. Do we need to include a different Video Card in the quote. (Most DOIM type IT guys won?t let an outside vendor in their machines for security reasons) 

Once we have the specs and requirements we will request that our IT shop outfit the computer as required. 

12.	Please clarify the ?Installation Kit? that is identified in the Video system, Monitor system and in the Rack system? In the video system I am assuming the projector mount. Monitor I am unclear unless the intention is to permanently mount to some surface. For the rack system I am assuming the accessories such as drawers, shelfs, lights and fan kits?? 

?Installation kit? was terminology used in earlier DLA projects for the components.  We intend to wall mount the monitors.  We simply mean all the parts to set up and install the rack system and other compenents needed in support of the VTC.

13.	Last but not least, did you ever consider a smartboard? They are such an asset and could really make this room valuable. I would recommend a 16X9 aspect ratio with 94? diagonal. Again, it replaces your screen, whiteboard and the need to be at the computer to control a presentation. The screen becomes a touchscreen. Even if done later, the system is designed to seamless add this technology and any other foreseeable so there isn?t a mentality of if you don?t do it now you are lost but it will greatly increase the value of the system. Having the Electronic Whiteboard work in conjunction with the Polycom product is amazing and therefore allows white board collaboration with any other VTC session.

The HQs location expressed a desire for this equipment after we put together the statement of work so we will be pursuing it after the vtc is installed.   New Cumberland does have a smart board but we did not integrate it into the vtc in the sow.  
 
SECOND SET:


1.	Projector (Mitsubishi); There are may versions, can you provide model number

Our requirement is for a current model projector with a minimum of 3000 lumens that will integrate with the other items in the requirement.

2.	VCR ? can you provide model number

Any current model VCR that will integrate with the other items in the requirement.

3.	,Installation Kit ? unsure what this refers to can you be specific

Our earlier installations used the terminology to describe the equipment needed to mount the monitors, speakers, cameras, projector, and rack assembly.  No specific requirements from here. 


4.	Matrix Switch ? there are many type fo swiches, Altinex Extron Auto patch and many configurations composite video S-Video BNC 8x4 8x8 16x16 etc can you provide model number or part number

Any current model that meets or exceeds the requirements and that will integrate with the other items in the requirement.


5.	VCR ? is this a typo or do you need two VCR?sor should it be a DVD/VCR combo player

Basic requirement is for a single VCR at each location, but a combination DVD/VCR would work fine also.


6.	Amplifier, how many channels 2 how many watts
7.	
Not specified.  We expect good quality sound for a medium sized conference room as stated.

8.	Mixer ? what size 4 or 8 channel, provide model number( eg Polycom Vortex 2280
Not specified.  We expect good quality sound for a medium sized conference room as stated.

11.	Video Conferencing Equipment (Polycom):     Which Polycom System VSX5000, 7000s,7000e, 8000 or HDX9001,9002 or 9004 
Whatever model meets our requirements at the best value to the government. 



12.	integration,tilt/pan camera ? How many cameras, are they Polycom cameras or Sony or Canon
Brand not specified.  Two cameras.  


13.	Base system, software -Polycom Options ? multipoint 4 or 6 way calling,;

Quotations should meet all instructions put forth in this combine synopsis/solicitation. PLEASE REVIEW THE FOLLWOWING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AND RESUBMIT YOUR PROPOSAL IF NECESSARY:

FIRST SET:

1.	May we substitute a different brand of projector? The Mitsubishi company owns NEC also and they have projectors that have twice the number of inputs with the same performance specs and are a thousand less. We have even had good performance with the Optoma brand. If this is unacceptable, would you please let me know the Mitsubishi model number of preference? One thing to check however, the projector needs a DVI input. They don?t have them until the models get into the commercial grade units.

Yes.  A different brand of projector may be used as long as it meets the standards as expressed in the original statement of work. The projectors are commonly used for power point presentations in the rooms and the main considerations are clarity and brightness, not brand.

2.	Please clarify if 2 VHS players are desired as in the quote? I would suggest we go to a single DVD / VHS combo player that has recordable DVD. They are only around 200 dollars. 

Either  a single VHS player or a DVD/VHS combination player would meet our needs.    

3.	What is the ceiling type? I assumed tile. It makes a difference on the type of mount to use. 

The ceiling type is a dropped grid type with lift out tiles.

4.	What is the ceiling height? Determines if we have to use an extension. 

HQ Location:		8?
Columbus Location:		9?
New Cumberland Location:	10?	



5.	Can we substitute the AMX volume control by integrating a different product that controls volume, scales video from all sources to DVI and performs all A/V switching? It is a fraction of the other cost. The AMX will still control volume, it just won?t need a separate module. 

Yes.  

6.	Why do we have a projector and Two monitors? I understand a monitor and a projector. Does each display need to be capable of showing a different source simultaneously? Just an understanding of location and function would help. 
We want the option to display to either the projector the monitor.  The projectors are to replace old existing units. The actual monitors are to be wall mounted. One monitor in the New Cumberland and Columbus locations and two will be located in the HQ location.  


7.	Where is the rack supposed to go? By calculation the rack needs to be at least 27U. Where you trying to integrate into the podium or is there space for it in the room?

We would like to place any rack which contains the controls, additional equipment etc. within the conference room itself.   It can be a standalone rack and does not need to integrate with a podium.  We would like it to be functional first, but as aesthetically pleasing as possible.

8.	What needs to be interfaced into the conference table through the ?furnishings? ? (HDMI, DVI, VGA, Component Video, S-Video, RCA audio, 3.5mm audio, USB cable and network ports, these are common, some have less) 

The only items we have planned to have on the conference table itself are cordless microphones used during the VTC.

9.	What is the floor made of underneath the conference table? If it is concrete then to get the cables to the table it will require core drillers. Not hard but just an additional cost.

The floors within each room are concrete. Core drilling may not be an option as, specifically in the Columbus and HQ areas, there is no access to the space below the floor. Cordless equipment is the preferred method for items placed on the conference room table.

10.	What is the purpose of having the vendor provide the Network Switch? Can it be a different Vendor? A managed switch from other than AMX can be 1/5th of the cost. How do you foresee the switch utilized in the conference room? 

We were assuming that inclusion of a network switch would provide additional flexibility as far as media used and points connected. It can be other than AMX. 

11.	The government supplied computer needs to have a dual output DVI ?d Video Card. This will be the need for any solution that wasn?t designed 4 years ago. Performance is significantly better and creates a uniform Video standard in the system. Not to mention HDTV capable. Do we need to include a different Video Card in the quote. (Most DOIM type IT guys won?t let an outside vendor in their machines for security reasons) 

Once we have the specs and requirements we will request that our IT shop outfit the computer as required. 

12.	Please clarify the ?Installation Kit? that is identified in the Video system, Monitor system and in the Rack system? In the video system I am assuming the projector mount. Monitor I am unclear unless the intention is to permanently mount to some surface. For the rack system I am assuming the accessories such as drawers, shelfs, lights and fan kits?? 

?Installation kit? was terminology used in earlier DLA projects for the components.  We intend to wall mount the monitors.  We simply mean all the parts to set up and install the rack system and other compenents needed in support of the VTC.

13.	Last but not least, did you ever consider a smartboard? They are such an asset and could really make this room valuable. I would recommend a 16X9 aspect ratio with 94? diagonal. Again, it replaces your screen, whiteboard and the need to be at the computer to control a presentation. The screen becomes a touchscreen. Even if done later, the system is designed to seamless add this technology and any other foreseeable so there isn?t a mentality of if you don?t do it now you are lost but it will greatly increase the value of the system. Having the Electronic Whiteboard work in conjunction with the Polycom product is amazing and therefore allows white board collaboration with any other VTC session.

The HQs location expressed a desire for this equipment after we put together the statement of work so we will be pursuing it after the vtc is installed.   New Cumberland does have a smart board but we did not integrate it into the vtc in the sow.  
 
SECOND SET:


1.	Projector (Mitsubishi); There are may versions, can you provide model number

Our requirement is for a current model projector with a minimum of 3000 lumens that will integrate with the other items in the requirement.

2.	VCR ? can you provide model number

Any current model VCR that will integrate with the other items in the requirement.

3.	,Installation Kit ? unsure what this refers to can you be specific

Our earlier installations used the terminology to describe the equipment needed to mount the monitors, speakers, cameras, projector, and rack assembly.  No specific requirements from here. 


4.	Matrix Switch ? there are many type fo swiches, Altinex Extron Auto patch and many configurations composite video S-Video BNC 8x4 8x8 16x16 etc can you provide model number or part number

Any current model that meets or exceeds the requirements and that will integrate with the other items in the requirement.


5.	VCR ? is this a typo or do you need two VCR?sor should it be a DVD/VCR combo player

Basic requirement is for a single VCR at each location, but a combination DVD/VCR would work fine also.


6.	Amplifier, how many channels 2 how many watts
7.

6) Is the control system wireless or hardwired?  Is the control system a color touch screen or keypad buttons?  What size touch screen is required?
We prefer wireless where possible. We prefer the color touch screen and of a sufficient size to provide easy viewing.

6a) What equipment and functions are to be controlled and integrated into the control system?
General VTC controls, sound, display options, cameras, document cam.  We are looking for a standard VTC set up so normal control functions would apply.  
7) How many computer inputs are desired into the system?  The specs indicate 2 at the table, is there another at the system rack provided by the Government?
Option for two at the conference table, and a computer will be permanently assigned to the VTC at the rack.  

8) Does the VTC system require People Plus Content for data graphics transmission? Does the system need to support Multi-Point? Is there a VTC switch used for Multi-Point? 
We need to plan for graphics transmission but we are not specifying PPC specifically.   Yes on the multi-point, and we have requested a vtc switch with the package.  

9) Is the VTC system Standard Definition or High Definition?
Standard definition.

All components of the system with the exception of the monitors should be rack mounted. This rack which would fit in a conference environment would be provided by the contractor.

11) Is the VTC system ISDN, IP or both?  Who is responsible to provision the network and verify all line conditions prior to installation?  Is the contractor expected to resolve network issues with 3rd party suppliers (Verizon, CIT, etc)?
The original statement of work requested that the system work over both media. Each location will arrange for the media; however the contractor would be expected to resolve network issues with 3rd party suppliers in conjunction with government representatives.

12) How cabling and power from the table be routed - floor channel? Core drill? Surface raceway?  Who provides and installs the table power and pathway?  Is there a floorbox required?
We would like as many items as possible to be wireless, if cabling needs to be run it would have to be surface raceway. The contractor would be expected to get the power to the table and provide the pathway. 

13) Is the 4 hour on-site response during normal business hours?
Yes.
14) Where there is perimeter seating in the room, is VTC audio microphone pickup required?
We anticipate this being handled by wireless mics which could be passed to the appropriate individual. These micro phones would be in addition to those placed upon the table.

Not sure what the however original statement of work defined room size as 16? X 30?.

15) What is the expected completion date? 
Completion would be expected no later than 90 days after award of contract.

16) What are the criteria for final completion and acceptance?
Completion and acceptance will be based upon a series of successful conferences among the three locations, training of personnel, proper functioning of all features and our ability to establish connection without contractor assistance.

17) Will the contractor have remote diagnostic access to the system and equipment via network or secured VPN? Is it acceptable or the contractor will need to provide diagnostic remote access at our expense?
Potentially, however network security may prevent this type of arrangement.  You should have another option.  
18) New Cumberland site indicates (1) LCD monitor but specifies pricing for 2. Please clarify.
The requirement is 1 monitor for both the Columbus and New Cumberland locations and 2 monitors in the HQ location.
