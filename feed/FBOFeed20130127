FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items (JUN 2008) applies to this acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated using a tradeoff analysis of non-price factors and price, as described below.  The Government will issue a contract to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government, after considering technical and price factors.   The Government intends to award a single fixed price contract as a result of this Solicitation, and intends to award without discussions.  The Government reserves the right to hold discussions if it deems them necessary.   <br>   <br> The following procedures apply to this solicitation: <br> DEFINITIONS: <br>  <br> Deficiency:  A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. <br>  <br> Weakness:  A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. <br>  <br> Risk: The potential for unsuccessful contract performance.  The consideration of risk assesses the degree to which an offeror's proposed approach to achieving the technical factor or criterion may involve risk of disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. <br>  <br> Significant Weakness:  A flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. <br>  <br> Strength:  An aspect of a proposal that has merit or exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance. <br>  <br> Team:  The offeror's  quote mark team quote mark  is the prime firm and its subcontracting firms, taken as a whole. <br>  <br> Relevant:   quote mark Relevant quote mark  means having a logical connection with the requirements in this RFP; that is, featuring work that is similar in nature, magnitude, and complexity to the current requirement. <br>  <br>  <br> TECHNICAL MERIT RATINGS:  The technical rating reflects the degree to which the proposed approach meets, or does not meet, the minimum performance or capability requirements through an assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, and risks of a proposal. The combined technical/risk rating includes consideration of risk in conjunction with the strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies in determining technical ratings. Combined technical/risk evaluations shall use one of the following combined technical/risk ratings: Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, Marginal and Unacceptable. <br>  <br> Evaluation factors for award are described below:   <br>  <br> Volume 1 - Technical: <br>  <br> Factor A. Relevant Experience - Offerors shall demonstrate relevant experience by providing project descriptions that show experience with debris related activities, including but not limited to recovery management, transfer station, temporary staging sites, and other relevant activities.  Offerors shall include up to three project descriptions in their proposal.  Projects shall have been completed within the last ten years.  Each project submission shall include the description of the project, dates of performance, customer point of contact and contact information.  <br>  <br> Factor B. Management / Operations Plan - Offerors shall provide a management and operations plan.  The plan shall include an organization identifying key sub-contractors and key personnel.  Key personnel shall include, at a minimum, an Operations Manager, a Safety Officer, and Quality Control Manager.  Provide resumes demonstrating experience with relevant activities, including those identified under Factor A.  Resumes will not count towards the page limit of the proposal.  The management and operations plan shall also include a narrative demonstrating sufficient availability of resources to accomplish the required tasks within the project schedule.  This shall include, but is not limited to, a discussion of available equipment and personnel.  <br>  <br> Factor C. Past Performance - Past performance information for the last ten years shall be obtained from any sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers, and Fee Determining Officials; and the Defense Contract Management Agency. <br>  <br> In addition, offerors may provide documentation of successful past performance that relates to projects included under Factor A of their proposal.  The lack of past performance information will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably for this factor. <br>  <br> There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation: Relevancy and Confidence.  The first is to evaluate the offeror's past performance to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the offeror is to the effort to be acquired through the source selection.  The criteria to establish what is recent and relevant are unique to this source selection.  In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to those aspects of an offeror's contract history that would give the greatest ability to measure whether the offeror will satisfy the current procurement.  Common aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type and degree of subcontract/teaming.  The four levels of relevancy are Very Relevant, Relevant, Somewhat Relevant, and Not Relevant. <br>  <br> The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts.  The Past Performance Evaluation Team will review this past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to performance confidence assessment.  In conducting a performance confidence assessment, each Offeror shall receive a rating of either Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence..   <br>  <br> Relative Importance of Factors: Factor A and B are equal in importance, but are more important than Factor C.  There will be an evaluation of price for reasonableness, but no rating of price.  The evaluation of the Price Schedule unit rates and price of the project will collectively be evaluated in determining the overall reasonableness of each offeror's cost/price proposal and the potential risk factor to the Government.  Price may be useful in establishing the competitive range prior to discussions (if such discussions are necessary). The degree of importance of cost as a factor shall become more important when technical proposals are of relatively equal merit.  There may be award to a higher cost/priced, higher rated offeror if the offer is sufficiently more advantageous than a lower cost/priced, lower rated offeror to justify the payment of a higher cost/price. When combined, the non-price factors are more important than price. <br>  <br>  <br> Prospective offerors must include with their proposal all information required by the Evaluation and Selection Procedures above, the Disaster or Emergency Area Representation required by FAR 52.226-3 (clause set out in full text below), and completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items with this offer. <br>    <br> The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and will remain in full force in any resultant award.  The full text of these clauses can be accessed electronically at website:  http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil or http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfarpgi/current/index.html.   <br>  <br> FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items;  <br> FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items <br>  <br> As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: <br> Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br>  <br> (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br>  <br> i.	Technical (consisting of Relevant Experience, Management/Operations, and Past Performance). <br> ii.	Price <br>  <br>  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br>  <br> (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br> (End of Provision) <br>  <br> FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; <br> FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items (Nov 2012) <br> (a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br> (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br> ____ Alternate I (AUG 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br> (2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br> (3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items (JUN 2008) applies to this acquisition.  All proposals submitted will be evaluated on best value cost-tradeoff analysis.  The Government will issue a contract to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government, after considering technical and price factors.   The Government intends to award a single fixed price contract as a result of this Solicitation, and intends to award without discussions.  The Government reserves the right to hold discussions if it deems them necessary.   <br>   <br> The following procedures apply to this solicitation: <br> DEFINITIONS: <br>  <br> Deficiency:  A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. <br>  <br> Weakness:  A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. <br>  <br> Risk: The potential for unsuccessful contract performance.  The consideration of risk assesses the degree to which an offeror's proposed approach to achieving the technical factor or criterion may involve risk of disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. <br>  <br> Significant Weakness:  A flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. <br>  <br> Strength:  An aspect of a proposal that has merit or exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance. <br>  <br> Team:  The offeror's  quote mark team quote mark  is the prime firm and its subcontracting firms, taken as a whole. <br>  <br> Relevant:   quote mark Relevant quote mark  means having a logical connection with the requirements in this RFP; that is, featuring work that is similar in nature, magnitude, and complexity to the current requirement. <br>  <br>  <br> TECHNICAL MERIT RATINGS:  The technical rating reflects the degree to which the proposed approach meets, or does not meet, the minimum performance or capability requirements through an assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, and risks of a proposal. The combined technical/risk rating includes consideration of risk in conjunction with the strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies in determining technical ratings. Combined technical/risk evaluations shall use one of the following combined technical/risk ratings: Outstanding, Good, Acceptable Marginal, and Unacceptable. <br>  <br> Evaluation factors for award are described below:   <br>  <br> Volume 1 - Technical: <br>  <br> Factor A. Relevant Experience - Offerors shall demonstrate relevant experience by providing projects descriptions that show experience with debris related activities, including but not limited to recovery management, transfer station, temporary staging sites, and other relevant activities.  Offerors shall include no more than three project descriptions in their proposal.  Projects shall have been completed within the last ten years.  The descriptions shall include a project descriptions, dates, customer point of contact,  and contact information.  <br>  <br> Factor B. Management / Operations Plan -  Offerors shall provide a management and operations plan.  The plan shall include an organization identifying key sub-contractors and key personnel.  Key personnel shall include, at a minimum, an Operations Manager, a Safety Officer, and Quality Control Manager.  Resumes shall also be included for the three required key personnel,   Resumes shall show experience with relevant activities, including those identified under Factor A.  Resumes will not count towards the page limit of the proposal.  The management and operations plan shall also include a narrative demonstrating sufficient availability of resources to accomplish the required tasks within the project schedule.  This shall include, but is not limited to, a discussion of available equipment and personnel. <br>  <br> Factor C. Past Performance - Past performance information for the last ten years shall be obtained from any sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers, and Fee Determining Officials; and the Defense Contract Management Agency. <br>  <br> In addition, offerors may provide documentation of successful past performance that relates to projects included under Factor A of their proposal.  The lack of past performance information will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably for this factor. <br>  <br> There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation: Relevancy and Confidence.  The first is to evaluate the offeror's past performance to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the offeror is to the effort to be acquired through the source selection. The criteria to establish what is recent and relevant shall be unique to each source selection and shall be stated in the solicitation. In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to those aspects of an offeror's contract history that would give the greatest ability to measure whether the offeror will satisfy the current procurement. Common aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming.  The four levels of relevancy are Very Relevant, Relevant, Somewhat Relevant, and Not Relevant. <br>  <br> The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts.  The Past Performance Evaluation Team will review this past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to performance confidence assessment.  In conducting a performance confidence assessment, each Offeror shall receive a rating of either Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence..   <br>  <br> Relative Importance of Factors: Factor A and B are equal in importance, but are more important than Factor C.  There will be an evaluation of price for reasonableness, but no rating of price.  The evaluation of the Bid Schedule unit rates and price of the project will collectively be evaluated in determining the overall reasonableness of each offeror's cost/price proposal and the potential risk factor to the Government.  Price may be useful in establishing the competitive range prior to discussions (if such discussions are necessary). The degree of importance of cost as a factor shall become more important when technical proposals are of relatively equal merit.  There may be award to a higher cost/priced, higher rated offeror if the offer is sufficiently more advantageous than a lower cost/priced, lower rated offeror to justify the payment of a higher cost/price. <br>  <br> Prospective offerors must include with their proposal all information required by the Evaluation and Selection Procedures above, the Disaster or Emergency Area Representation required by FAR 52.226-3 (clause set out in full text below), and completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items with this offer.   <br>  <br> The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and will remain in full force in any resultant award.  The full text of these clauses can be accessed electronically at website:  http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil or http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfarpgi/current/index.html.   <br>  <br> FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items;  <br>  <br> 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items <br>  <br> As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: <br> Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br>  <br> (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br>  <br> i.	Technical (consisting of Relevant Experience, Management/Operations, and Past Performance). <br> ii.	Price <br>  <br>  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br>  <br> (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br> (End of Provision) <br>  <br> FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; <br> FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items (Nov 2012) <br> (a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br> (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br> ____ Alternate I (AUG 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br> (2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br> (3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.
