<SOLNBR>03SQ1U0300
<RESPDATE>080103
<ARCHDATE>07292004
<CONTACT>Norbert Ries Chief of Planning  ;
<DESC>NA The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife.The proposed action is to assist The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) in initiating the Yakima River Basin Water Storage Options Feasibility Study, Washington (Storage Study).  Assistance is requested from Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) in (1) defining potential fish and wildlife issues, concerns and benefits which may be associated with construction, operation and maintenance of additional water storage facilities, and (2) scoping of work activities to evaluate the potential fish and wildlife resources issues, concerns and benefits. Background: The Storage Study was authorized by section 214 of the Act of February 20, 2003.  This Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through Reclamation, to conduct a feasibility study of options for additional water storage in the Yakima River Basin, with emphasis on the storage of water in the potential Black Rock Reservoir, and the benefit of such storage to endangered and threatened fish, irrigated agriculture, and municipal water supply.   The Washington State Legislature (2003 First Special Session) authorized the expenditure of State Water Supply Facilities funds for the development of plans, engineering, and financing reports, and other preconstruction activities associated with the development of water storage projects in the Yakima River basin.  Inherent in this authorization is the State?s intent to participate as a cost-share partner in the Storage Study.  As an element of this participation and supported by State funds, it is proposed that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) conduct the work proposed herein, in coordination with FWS.  Proposed Work:  The proposed work is divided into two components; Yakima River and Columbia River.  For each component, the WDFW shall provide the following: Yakima River: An overview of the sub-basin planning and salmon recovery activities currently underway.  This should identify, among other things, the purposes of these activities, involved entities, anticipated products, and estimated completion dates.  The relationship of these activities to the Storage Study should also be discussed as well as suggestions for coordination of study efforts. Possible fish and wildlife issues, concerns and benefits (at-site and basin-wide) related to the potential construction, operation and maintenance of possible Yakima River storage augmentation plan elements.  These should be identified for each plan element as well as for a ?cumulative? project including all or several plans elements. Columbia River: Fishery Resources An overview of recently completed activities (last five years) and activities currently underway related to the protection and enhancement of fishery resources in the Hanford Reach.  This should include a synopsis of (a) anadromous fishery species spawning, rearing, and migrating through that segment of the Hanford Reach extending about 4 miles downstream from Priest Rapids Dam, (b) resident fishery species, and (c) current and possible future daily and monthly operating criteria applicable to Rapids Priest Dam for the protection and enhancement of the fishery resources.  Particular emphasis should be on identifying fishery issues, concerns and benefits associated with the potential withdrawal of up to 4,000 cfs from (a) the Priest Rapids Reservoir forebay, or (b) the Columbia River at alternate locations in the downstream four-mile segment and possible fishery resources issues, concerns and benefits related to the potential construction, operation and maintenance of Black Rock Project plan elements.   Wildlife Resources: An overview of recently completed activities (last five years) and activities currently underway related to protection and enhancement of wildlife resources in the Hanford National Monument Area (west side of the Columbia River) and the adjacent potential Black Rock Project area, and possible wildlife issues, concerns and benefits related to the potential construction, operation and maintenance of Black Rock Project plan elements.   Coordination with Fish and Wildlife Service:  WDFW shall coordinate the proposed work with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as an element of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act.   Deliverables:  WDFW shall provide a draft report (and electronic version) to Reclamation and FWS by September 15, 2003, and a final report within 15 working days of receipt of any comments from Reclamation unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Reclamation and WDFW. Funding:  This work shall be funded as a part of the Memorandum of Understanding among the Washington Department of Ecology, WDFW, and Reclamation.   The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses received by close of business August 2, 2003 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attention: Connie Morgan or by electronic mail at cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov. No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Zonge Engineering, 3222 E. Fort Lowell RD, Tucson, AZ 85716.  The proposed contract is for a transient electromagnetic (TEM) induction system to include a multi-channel GDP-32II, dual function NANOTEM/ZEROTEM transmitter system, TEM antenna, vertical stand and NANOTEM card.  Although there are other vendors that offer TEM systems, a comparable system from another vendor would be more expensive than the system offered by Zone Engineering.  The Zonge system is based on a multi-channel GDP-32 that is fully digital and affords a great deal of expandability.  In addition, the Zone Engineering NANOTEM/ZEROTEM dual-function transmitter system allows for the acquisition of very early-time data.  The system can be expanded to allow for increased power output (depth of investigation) and can be configured for DC resistivity/IP measurements.  System expansion and configuration is accomplished through the addition of integrated circuit cards that can either be rented or purchased from the manufacturer.  Zonge Engineering is the only vendor that markets TEM systems that offer multi-channel acquisition and dual-function transmitter capability.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government; no additionl synopsis will be published.

Seeking organizations to perform the following:

Develop a program that facilitates the development of infrastructure that will enable protein biomarker discovery in cancer.

Core elements of the project:
.	Establish a consortium of laboratories that will develop and evaluate the capability of protein detection and measurement technologies to identify proteins relevant to cancer.  The project should be conducted by a minimum of three laboratories that will collaborate to utilize the same biological specimens for protein detection and analysis.
.	Apply technology approaches to protein identification and quantitation that include separation techniques and protein detection and identification methods including high throughput mass spectrometry (SELDI-or MALD-TOF,LC/MS,LC/tandem MS, and affinity methods such as protein chip array, peptide aptamers, and isotope-coded affinity tagging.  (This project does not include development of technologies applied to 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis.)
.	Facilitate technology engineering that will improve the detection and identification of proteins, digested protein fragments, and peptides in serum.
.	To provide standardized measurements enabling characterization of serum soluble proteins, the laboratories will utilize a minimum of 12 in-bred mouse strain models representing different, well-characterized cancer tumors for serum protein measurement.
.	The research project will include assessment of protein profiles (molecular signatures) from samples using two approaches: random protein identification in mouse serum and, a targeted “candidate” approach that utilizes labeled known peptides to identify specific protein moieties identified in the MS approach.
.	The laboratories will develop a common resources for sharing among members of the consortium including: specimens (serum and plasma), reagents (monoclonal, polyclonal, and single chain antibodies), and data obtained from the protein measurements. 
.	The consortium will establish a data and resource coordinating center that will facilitate communication and resource exchange for the project.

Conditions:
.	The period of performance will be two years.  The NCI-Frederick (SAIC-Frederick) anticipates making awards to 1 or more consortiums (each consisting of at least 3 individual laboratories).
.	It is assumed that significant technology will be brought to and developed from research and development conducted on the project.  Contractors are notified that restrictions will be sought on exclusive licensing of some reagents and technologies developed from the project. [Does NCI intend to request a DEC?]
.	Data developed from the project will be placed in the public domain (publications or database).

Specific Tasks:
.	Develop plan for use of a minimum of 12 individual in-bred mouse strains for acquisition of serum and plasma.
.	Develop reagents for antibodies, proteins and peptide arrays.
.	Develop database and informatics support for archiving and analysis of proteomic data
.	Develop standard assay materials, i.e., plasma, and serum, from mouse models.
.	Sponsor workshops around the design, evaluation, and analysis of technology development and project design and progress assessment.
.	Develop milestones and deliverables of interest to broad research community.
 
Interested offerors should submit an expression of interest with a statement of capabilities and a 5-page summary approach plan.

SAIC-Frederick/NCI will review the Statement of Capability to determine qualified offerors to receive solicitation.  

The Statement of Capabilities and the 5 page plan should be submitted to Kim Nusbaum by August 29, 2003.

Upon review and determination of qualified offerors, the solicitation will be issued within approximately 2 weeks.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Diversity intends to procure on a non-competitive basis with the National Training Lab (NTL) Institute for Applied Behavioral Science to facilitate Survey Feedback Action (SFA) workgroup meetings for NOAA executives and managers. The objective of SFA workgroup meetings is to identify and address understanding differences issues, behaviors, systems, policies and practices that are not inclusive and to work on ways to improve them. NTL trainers are familiar with NOAA's organizational culture and have experience in working with NOAA leaders, as they conducted leadership training for NOAA executives and managers during the NOAA Diversity Network conference, and have conducted SFA Facilitator training for NOAA's in-house cadre of  SFA Facilitators. NTL trainers are uniquely qualified to facilitate SFA meetings because they understand the value that differences can bring to an organization's internal workings, and have studied and shared these practices in their approach to individual, group, and organization change. NTL trainers are eminent practitioners and prominent experts in the areas of diversity, group theory, organizational development, personal growth and social change. NTL's Human Interaction labs are the most popular, the most replicated, and the most effective programs offered for changing human attitudes and behaviors. Their new applications of experiential learning have emerged to represent the most current and cutting edge programs in the fields of change management, human resources, organizational development, training, and diversity. NTL's renowned Journal of Applied Behavioral Science contributes a body of knowledge to the field that increases understanding of change processes and outcomes; and the publication continues to grow in reputation and prestige around the world. While other trainers have been considered,  NTL is the only company with substantial technical expertise and experience to identify, understand and address issues of diversity tension, diversity conflict, attitudes and behaviors which surface during SFA meetings.  Any source that believes it can supply the required service should respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirement, within 45 days of this notice, to the above address. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  See note 22.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 14, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, intends to make a sole source award to Dr. Eliot Marseille, D.Ph., MPP, Principal Research Associate for the Institute for Health Policy Studies, University of California, San Francisco, CA, for non-personnel services to provide analytical support.   The proposed contractor is to develop a cost effectiveness model, analyze and  prepare a publishable manuscript on the relative cost effectiveness comparing the use  of either maternal Highly Active Antiretrovirals (HAART) during late pregnancy and  breast feeding in resource limited  settings when compared to prolonged infant antiretroviral prophylaxis during breast feeding. Upon investigation of the Contractor’s  qualifications, Dr. Marseille is in a unique position to bring his expert knowledge of modeling the relative cost effectiveness of the maternal HAART and infant prophylaxis trials which are underway so that when efficacy results are available, then their relative cost effectiveness will be also available to help inform health polices for ministries of health and international agencies. Dr. Marseille is the only known vendor who is both  an expert in the cost effectiveness of  perinatal HIV prevention strategies and in determining antiretroviral costs in resource limited settings;  and who has already developed cost effectiveness models and analyzed related  data in carrying out  earlier research on perinatal HIV interventions.  It would not be cost effective for the Epidemiology Branch to attempt to recruit and train another individual to perform the highly technical time sensitive work described above.  Period of performance is from Date of Award and continue for a period of 11 months. This notice is for informational purposes only. This is not a request for competitive quotes. Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond within ten days of this announcement. All responses must be in writing by facsimile to the Contracting Officer at (770-) 488-2847 or email dreedpenix@cdcs.gov. A determination not to continue with this acquisition based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

Teale Data Center, PO Box 1810, 3101 Gold Camp Drive, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741 under FAR 6.302-1.  The procurement is for leasing of hardware and network connectivity to access the California State Offender Based Information System (OBIS).  Teale Data Center holds the OBIS contract with the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency of the State of California and is the only source which will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement includes equipment (3270 terminals, 8 port-1174 controllers, and printers), data circuit network connectivity, and teleprocessing support services.  The period of performance is to be a base year of October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004 with two (2) one year option years.  OBIS is a centralized system in which all California Department of Corrections’ institutions and parole regions are linked via the Teale Data Center.  OBIS network provides detailed and timely information on every inmate in the California State prison system to include biographical data, criminal history, past and current warrants and detainers, history of inmate movement and location within the California Department of Corrections, earliest release date calculations, along with legal status and conviction information from the California Superior Court.   Access to OBIS is controlled by the State of California.  The OBIS network assists Federal law enforcement agencies within California under the Department of Homeland Security in identifying, interviewing, processing and obtaining record information on criminal aliens within the California Department of Corrections.  Equipment is currently installed at 13 Federal sites throughout California (may change as mission needs expand throughout the contract period).  This is not a request for quotation/proposal and no quotation/proposal document will be issued.  Interested contractors who believe that they can meet these requirements shall submit in writing their detailed technical capability, network connectivity authorization to OBIS, and pricing structure via email by August 15, 2003.

This Federal Business  Opportunities, (FedBizOpps) announcement constitutes a Notice of  Contract  Action (NOCA) for proposed contract award to The Boeing Company. ESC/SRK  intends to award a contract with a period of performance of four (4)  years, to provide for the Multimedia Message Manager (M3) software  maintenance.  M3 software maintenance includes all labor to perform the  following software engineering tasks: 1) Maintain and troubleshoot the  current M3 software and documentation baseline as required.  2) Operate  and manage the M3 8x5 Code 2 help desk (Code 2 problems adversely affect  the operation of the system).  3) Operate and manage the M3 24x7 Code 1  help desk  (Code 1 problems prevent the accomplishment of  essential/critical system capabilities).  4) Install M3 (including  hardware, software, network and CSP connections, etc.) at  new customer sites.  5) Provide M3 training for System Administrators  (SA), Information System Security Managers (ISSM), Profile  Administrators  (PA) and Users at new customer sites.  6) Support M3 Security  Accreditation Testing (SAT) at new customer sites.  7) Transition old  message traffic to M3 at new customer sites.  8) Create initial M3  profile  set and accounts at new customer sites. 9) Implement new functional  enhancements and bug fixes in M3 for new version releases as required.  10)  Update all M3 documentation for new version releases as required.  11)  Upgrade existing customer sites to latest M3 version releases with  little  or no disruption of operational services.  The Government intends to  solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR  6-302-1  entitled "Only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy  agency requirements:" Authorization to  do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304-A9(1).  The Government  considers  that an award to any source other than The Boeing Company would likely  result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be  recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in filling the  Government's requirements.  Current M3 functionality must continue to  maintain continuity of vital message handling services supporting  national-level intelligence requirements.  The Government has determined  that a new competitive solicitation for the M3 would incur substantial  duplication of costs in relation to technical and configuration  knowledge  of the M3, which would not be recovered through competition as well as  the  loss of critical uninterrupted software maintenance.  This notice does  not  constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government  as  to the ultimate acquisition  approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Call Heidi Bosinger-Waldron,  Contract Specialist, (781) 377-4056, EMAIL  Heidi.Bosinger-Waldron@hanscom.af.mil, or Patricia Sullivan, Contracting  Officer, (781) 377-3956, EMAIL:  Patricia.Sullivan@hanscom.af.mil  See Notes 22 and 26.

The Enclosure for the electronics interface components shall be pole mounted in the same configuration as the existing AN/FMQ-13 wind monitor. 2.0 Interface Requirements.  The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall interface to the following legacy FMQ-13 equipment: Digital Display Indicator ID-2408/FMQ-13(V) and Wind Direction and Speed Recorder RO-588/FMQ-13(V).  3.0 Accuracy Requirements.   The wind range of the wind speed sensor shall be 0-115 knots, with an accuracy of  +/-1 knot (0-24kts) and +/- 10% above 24kts.  Resolution shall be 1kt.  The wind direction accuracy shall be within 5 degrees.  The resolution shall be 10 degrees (0 to 359 degrees). The wind direction sensor shall be aligned to true north.  After removing the sensor from its mounting for maintenance, the sensor design shall enable the accurate restoration of directional alignment without the necessity for another alignment survey.  The sensors shall be sampled at a rate sufficient to provide five-second averages. 4.0 Environmental Requirements.  The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall meet the following environmental requirements: Operating Temperature: from -62 *C to +54 *C;  Storage/Transport Temperature: from -51 *C to +60 *C; Relative Humidity:  0% to 100%.;  Wind:  Up to 115 knots;  The wind speed and direction sensors shall operate within the accuracy requirements specified, during conditions of 0.25-inch radial thickness of clear ice and wind speeds higher than 10 knots.  5.0 Electromagnetic Compatibility Requirements.

The operational performance shall not be degraded by electromagnetic environmental effects (E3).   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). This contract action represents a contract for which the Government considers that an award to any source other than Coastal Environmental Systems would likely result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements. In addition, the Contractor must be able to produce up to 30 systems a month for the life of the contract. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but rather a notice of the Government's intent. The Government intends to issue a solicitation on or about 13 August 2003.  Award of this contract will be made on or about 21 November 2003. Additional information may be obtained from the POC/Contracting Officer listed above. See Notes 22 and 26.

<CONTACT>Carol Meyer, Sr. License Administrator, Phone (303) 275-4269, Fax (303) 275-3040, Email carol_meyer@nrel.gov - Carol Meyer, Sr. License Administrator, Phone (303) 275-4269, Fax (303) 275-3040, Email carol_meyer@nrel.gov
<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, anticipates negotiating license agreements with U.S Companies interested in commercializing a fiber optic hydrogen gas sensor that has applications in the transportation industry (hydrogen powered vehicles), weld inspections, measuring pipeline integrity, semiconductor, fuel cells, and petro-chemical industries.  The sensor is based on the chemochromic reaction of WO3 (Tungsten Oxide) with hydrogen.  The sensor would be inexpensive, generates results quickly and correlates with measurements taken with standard gas chromatography.  The technology is covered by a patent, U.S. # 5,708,735, and several pending patents.

NREL is seeking collaboration with commercial partners to make this technology available to various industries.  NREL has three objectives that we would like to accomplish through the grant of licenses: (1) to transfer the technology to private sector partners with a strong interest in deploying this technology, (2) to receive fair, reasonable and customary monetary compensation for the investment that DOE has made in developing this technology, and (3) to promote the use of US developed technology to help maintain competitive leadership for US-based business in the global market place.

NREL is seeking unique proposals from commercial partners to develop business plans that will deploy this advanced technology in the market place.

Qualifications of potential licensee: Respondents to this announcement should be familiar with the fiber optic sensor industry, hydrogen sensor field, and/or transportation, petro-chemical, fuel cell, and pipeline industries, and have the resources and expertise in design, development and marketing of a commercial fiber optic sensor system.  Respondents should be prepared to produce a business plan or commercialization pathway for the use of this technology. The respondents may feel retention of NREL expertise to develop and implement this technology might be of benefit to a timely and orderly transfer of the technology to the licensee.  In that case, the respondents’ ability to fund the labor necessary to transfer the technology will be considered a component of the overall compensation package for the licenses. Creative proposals are encouraged, however, the respondent will have the burden of demonstrating the present and future values of any in-kind contributions that are included in their offering. THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Organizations interested in commercializing NREL technologies will provide their own financial resources to commercialize the technology. NREL reserves the right to withdraw this announcement of our intent to license the mentioned technologies if it does not produce responses that substantially address our vision for commercialization.

Questions and expressions of interest may be addresses to Richard Bolin, Fax: (303) 275-3040, or E-mail: Richard_bolin@nrel.gov

<DESC>This proposal combines several processes that have historically been accomplished by numerous individual contracts.  In the past, separate contracts have been awarded for logging and fuels reduction in the same general area.  Each of these was designed to meet the management objectives for a narrow range of resources.  Fuel reduction was for fire management goals; logging and thinning were for timber and fire management goals.  This proposal combines all of these operations into one contract to take advantage of the efficiencies of having one larger operation meet multiple objectives.

It is expected that contractor profits resulting from the subsequent sale of sawtimber, which is being provided at minimum rates, will offset a portion of the costs associated with other contractual requirements.   

The purpose of this contract is to secure a complete set of services to accomplish stand treatments related to the thinning of plantation trees.  This contract also provides road maintenance and erosion control activities associated with product treatment and removal necessary for soil and water resource protection.  The contractor shall take given sets of resource objectives for each unit, develop a plan to accomplish these objectives, and organize and direct all of the equipment and personnel needed to accomplish the work.  The contractor shall furnish all technical expertise, labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals necessary to complete the work required.  This solicitation should be available for downloading from this site, on or about August 14, 2003.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dale Jorgenson Associates (DJA) of Cambridge, MA to provide a revised and expanded version of an economic analysis tool (the Second Generation Model Intertemporal General Equilibrium Model (SGM-IGEM) Reduced Form Model).  The Reduced Form Model is a "desktop" economic model capable of showing the aggregate response of the economy to various policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.  This work is in support of the Office of Air and Radiation's Office of  Atmospheric Program's Clean Air Market Division.  DJA has extensive experience in modeling the relationship of energy use, the environment, and the economy.  The contractor maintains a proprietary modeling tool that provides them with the unique capability of developing the analysis tool required  by EPA.  Therefore, DJA will provide the most timely, cost-effective means of completing this project.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice  is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The EPA intends to issue the requirement,  on a noncompetitive basis, to Duke University, Nicholas School of the Environment.  Under a previous procurement,  using a third generation Relaxed Eddy Accumulation (REW) system, Duke University, collected a limited flux measurement data set in the fall of 2002 to develop field operational protocols and evaluate chromatographic separation suitability for the pine forest atmosphere.  As a result of this work, procedures were established to 1) optimize REA internal pressure and gas flow rates prior to data sample  collection, 2) ozone scrubber placement and performance were evaluated, and  3) chromatographic columns were changed to maximize separation of biogenic emissions from adsorbent artifacts (a-pinene resolved from benzaldehyde peak).  To address the possible impacts of some of these factors on  terpenoid emissions from southern U.S. forests, under this procurement, the Contractor shall conduct a seasonal flux study over a Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) plantation at the Free Atmosphere Carbon Transfer Scheme (FACTS1) site in the Blackwood Division of Duke Forest near Chapel Hill, NC. The REA  will be operated by the Contractor to measure biogenic VOC fluxes. Samples will be collected by the Contractor by adsorbing target analytes onto solid adsorbent media.  NO SOLICITATIION WILL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE.  Any organization that feels that it can meet EPA's requirements must  submit documentation so support it qualifications to perform the work no later than 15 days after posting of this notice.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The applicable NAICS code is 334516.  Parties should submit their technical  documentation to Mike Hennessey, using the following methods: 1.) by fax to 513.487.2109, or 2.) by email (hennessey.mike@epa.gov) referencing OH -03-00415.

<DESC>The Access Board through Department of Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a simplified acquisition to the Institute of Transportation Engineers,  1099 14th St NW #300 West, Washington DC 20005, to plan, conduct and report on an industry workshop on directional cuing for pedestrians with vision impairments.  The Access Board plans to convene transportation engineering, orientation and mobility, and disability organization representatives in an intensive workshop to consider potential changes in curb ramp design and intersection engineering that could provide directional cues to crossing travel by pedestrians who have vision impairments.  Although blind pedestrians principally use auditory cues to establish and maintain a heading for crossing the street, quieter cars, right-turn-on-red, and complex signaling operations make audible cues less useful today.  Directional curb ramps, tactile surfaces, audible beaconing, and other changes could make additional environmental cues available to augment and confirm auditory information and facilitate the crossing of streets and intersections by blind persons.  The Institute of  Transportation Engineers will develop an agenda for the workshop, develop a contact list of workshop participants, develop and produce workshop materials, conduct the workshop and document the results.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.	  Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 2:00 PM, EDT on August 13, 2003.  Affirmative responses shall reference RFQ03-098 and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required item or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a sole-source award will be made to the Institute of Transportation Engineers.

<DESC>17.	 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers to RFQ #3036.  This solicited document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-14.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 481219 and the small-business size standard is $6,000,000.  The International Center for Excellence in Research (ICER) is supporting the continuing research efforts of the Rakai Project in Uganda.  The Rakai Project, established in 1988, is a research and training collaboration between the Uganda Virus Research Institute/Uganda Ministry of Health; researchers at Makerere University in Kampala; Columbia University; Johns Hopkins University; and intramural scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The project operates in the rural Rakai District in Southwestern Uganda, and has established one of the largest HIV and reproductive health population-based cohorts in the world.   Currently, the cohort population is approximately 12,000 persons, aged 15-49, residing in 50 rural communities.  The project performs many research activities on HIV and STDs (HSV-2, HPV, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, Chlamydia and Trichomona, Bacterial Vaginosis/BV), including their effects on pregnancy, fertility, infant survival, placental pathology and mother-to-child HIV transmission.  To assist in this project, the NIAID is sending approximately 12,000 lbs. of laboratory materials via airfreight.  Additionally, three (3) forty (40) foot containers of laboratory materials will be shipped by sea freight.  We are seeking a shipping company – contractor that can meet the following requirements:  The shipping company must receive the freight in a warehouse (at no additional cost to the NIAID) and do a detailed inventory of each item that comes in.  The shipping company must note shortages, overages, expiration dates, voltages, and other crucial information relevant to the items that will be shipped.  The shipping company must hold the cargo at the warehouse until all items for a particular shipment have arrived and/or until the NIAID Project Officer has given them authorization to ship.  Each time that a new item is received in the warehouse, a material receipt must be sent by email to the person involved for them to check and also let him/her know what we have received.  Once the shipping company has received shipping authorization, they must assemble the items on hand and pack them into tri-wall boxes or crates in order to eliminate any potential damage.  (The choice of container is at the contractor’s discretion; however, the container must provide optimal protection at the least expense to the government.)  The contractor must do a detailed inventory of each item packed per box.  This inventory must be completely accurate to facilitate customs inspection in Uganda by enabling the customs agent to look at a specific item quickly and easily.  The contractor must pack and inventory the items in a fashion that alleviates the necessity for customs agents to search through each and every box.  If there is anything delicate in the shipment, the shipper must insure that it will not be broken in transit by using void packs or any other means necessary.  The shipper must also keep items refrigerated that need to be refrigerated, both in the warehouse before shipment and during transport. Once the items are packed, the shipper must produce a full set of documents for the shipment.  These shall include, but not be limited to, packing list, valued inventory, and commercial invoice.  The shipper must also prepare all of the export documentation such as the air waybill and the export declaration filing.  The shipper must e-mail and fax all of these documents (or whatever is stipulated by the NIAID Project Officer) to the people involved in the shipment several days prior to the shipments arrival in Uganda.  This will allow the agent in Uganda to begin the customs process; moreover, it allows the goods to be delivered in a timely manner.  The shipper must then transport the goods to the airport that they will be shipped from.  Once the shipment has left the shipper's warehouse, the contractor must trace the shipment before and after each flight.  Updates must be sent to the Project Officer accordingly.  Upon the shipments’ arrival, the shipper must contact the agent to confirm and then send confirmation to all of the parties involved.  The shipper must then stay in contact with the agent in Uganda to make sure the delivery goes smoothly.  The shipper must then send confirmation of safe passage via email to the NIAID Project Officer. The shipper must be responsible for all aspects of the shipping.  At no point should NIAID personnel be involved in getting the shipment through customs. The shipper must demonstrate at least five (5) years of experience shipping research equipment and reagents to Uganda. The government intends to make a best value buy to the responsible offeror whose offer is most advantageous to the government.  The evaluation criteria will include 1) price, 2) technical experience and 3) ability to meet the government’s delivery schedule.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition are FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items.  Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions of FAR 52.212-3, Offerors’ Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items.  Offers must be submitted not later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time, August 14, 2003.  For delivery of responses through the Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, MSC/4812, Room/2NE70D, Bethesda, MD  20817-4812.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to procure, on a sole source basis with the Cognos Corporation the “Cognos Metrics Manager (CMM).  The CMM would allow CMS to measure the performance of contractors by giving contract managers an at-a-glance means of knowing how contractors are tracking targets or objectives of key performance indicators and against other contractors.  Instead of creating manual reports or spreadsheets to analyze the data, users can access easy to understand visualizations of data across multiple systems (CROWD, CAFM II, PULSE).  Now contractor managers and analysts can have a visual holistic view of contractor performance.  CMS would not have to recreate cubes or reports to capture the CMM data.  Current reports or cubes that includes CMM data could be used as the data source.  For example, the Key Metrics report could be used as a data source for CMM.  Users could visually see a contractor’s performance against a pre-defined performance metric and drill thru to the data cube for more detail.  If no responses are received within 45 days from the published data of this notice, a purchase order shall be awarded to the Cognos Corporation, 1595 Spring Hill Road, Vienna, VA  22182.  An RFQ package is not available.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, anticipates negotiating license agreements with U.S Companies interested in commercializing a fiber optic hydrogen gas sensor that has applications in the transportation industry (hydrogen powered vehicles), weld inspections, measuring pipeline integrity, semiconductor, fuel cells, and petro-chemical industries.  The sensor is based on the chemochromic reaction of WO3 (Tungsten Oxide) with hydrogen.  The sensor would be inexpensive, generates results quickly and correlates with measurements taken with standard gas chromatography.  The technology is covered by a patent, U.S. # 5,708,735, and several pending patents.

NREL is seeking collaboration with commercial partners to make this technology available to various industries.  NREL has three objectives that we would like to accomplish through the grant of licenses: (1) to transfer the technology to private sector partners with a strong interest in deploying this technology, (2) to receive fair, reasonable and customary monetary compensation for the investment that DOE has made in developing this technology, and (3) to promote the use of US developed technology to help maintain competitive leadership for US-based business in the global market place.

NREL is seeking unique proposals from commercial partners to develop business plans that will deploy this advanced technology in the market place.

Qualifications of potential licensee: Respondents to this announcement should be familiar with the fiber optic sensor industry, hydrogen sensor field, and/or transportation, petro-chemical, fuel cell, and pipeline industries, and have the resources and expertise in design, development and marketing of a commercial fiber optic sensor system.  Respondents should be prepared to produce a business plan or commercialization pathway for the use of this technology. The respondents may feel retention of NREL expertise to develop and implement this technology might be of benefit to a timely and orderly transfer of the technology to the licensee.  In that case, the respondents’ ability to fund the labor necessary to transfer the technology will be considered a component of the overall compensation package for the licenses. Creative proposals are encouraged, however, the respondent will have the burden of demonstrating the present and future values of any in-kind contributions that are included in their offering. THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Organizations interested in commercializing NREL technologies will provide their own financial resources to commercialize the technology. NREL reserves the right to withdraw this announcement of our intent to license the mentioned technologies if it does not produce responses that substantially address our vision for commercialization.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, anticipates negotiating license agreements with U.S Companies interested in commercializing a fiber optic hydrogen gas sensor that has applications in the transportation industry (hydrogen powered vehicles), weld inspections, measuring pipeline integrity, semiconductor, fuel cells, and petro-chemical industries.  The sensor is based on the chemochromic reaction of WO3 (Tungsten Oxide) with hydrogen.  The sensor would be inexpensive, generates results quickly and correlates with measurements taken with standard gas chromatography.  The technology is covered by a patent, U.S. # 5,708,735, and several pending patents.

NREL is seeking collaboration with commercial partners to make this technology available to various industries.  NREL has three objectives that we would like to accomplish through the grant of licenses: (1) to transfer the technology to private sector partners with a strong interest in deploying this technology, (2) to receive fair, reasonable and customary monetary compensation for the investment that DOE has made in developing this technology, and (3) to promote the use of US developed technology to help maintain competitive leadership for US-based business in the global market place.

NREL is seeking unique proposals from commercial partners to develop business plans that will deploy this advanced technology in the market place.

Qualifications of potential licensee: Respondents to this announcement should be familiar with the fiber optic sensor industry, hydrogen sensor field, and/or transportation, petro-chemical, fuel cell, and pipeline industries, and have the resources and expertise in design, development and marketing of a commercial fiber optic sensor system.  Respondents should be prepared to produce a business plan or commercialization pathway for the use of this technology. The respondents may feel retention of NREL expertise to develop and implement this technology might be of benefit to a timely and orderly transfer of the technology to the licensee.  In that case, the respondents’ ability to fund the labor necessary to transfer the technology will be considered a component of the overall compensation package for the licenses. Creative proposals are encouraged, however, the respondent will have the burden of demonstrating the present and future values of any in-kind contributions that are included in their offering. THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Organizations interested in commercializing NREL technologies will provide their own financial resources to commercialize the technology. NREL reserves the right to withdraw this announcement of our intent to license the mentioned technologies if it does not produce responses that substantially address our vision for commercialization.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, hereby extends the Southeast and Southwest Region CAPT proposal due date until August 29, 2003 at 3:00 p.m.

In a letter dated June 10, 2003, SAMHSA promised to forward a copy of the RFP when it was published to all of the original CAPT cooperative agreement applicants.  However, due to an administrative oversight, this was not done in two regions.  Therefore, in order to be fair to all potential offerors, the due date for these two regions has been extended.

If you had submitted a proposal under either the Southeast or Southwest Region, you may choose to make no changes to your proposal, amend the proposal submitted, or collect your proposal and submit a new one.

If you have not received a copy of the solicitation, this may be obtained in any of three ways; by mail; picked up in person at 5515 Security Lane, Suite 640, Rockville, MD 20852; or, electronically at the SAMHSA web site: http:/samhsa.gov/contracts.  If you have a continuing interest in the RFP, notify the primary point of contact that you wish copies of amendments to the RFP (if any) to be sent to you, or check the Web Site regularly for amendments which will also be posted there.  Note: If you rely on the Web Site for obtaining amendments, SAMHSA has no way to assure, and therefore assumes no responsibility for assuring you have downloaded these amendments.  Requests for copies of the RFP must be made in writing.  Requests will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis until the supply is exhausted; however, there is no assurance that copies requested after August 20, 2003 will reach the requestor before the due date for receipt of responses. Requests shall be forwarded to the attention of Lynn Tantardini, Contract Specialist, Division of Contracts Management, OPS, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Rockwall II Building, Room 640, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857.  Requests may be sent via fax to (301)594-0535.  Electronic mail and telephone requests will not be honored.  * * * * *

<DESC>The Government intends to award a contract for up to 314 Wind Sensor Modification Kits with two options for 100 additional kits each to Coastal Environmental Systems, Seattle, WA for a period of 4 years (inclusive of options) from FY 04 through FY 08. The kits are designed to provide an interface between legacy wind indicators, nomenclature AN/FMQ-13, and a newer RM Young wind sensor.   The Wind Sensor Modification Kit is described in paragraphs 1.0 to 5.0:  1.0 Physical Description.  The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall consist of: An RM Young wind monitor; Electronics to translate the signals from the RM Young into the correct protocol to respond with the data required from the legacy AN/FMQ-13 indicator; a compatible Bell - 202 modem; a power supply; a terminal strip for existing power and communications cables to connect to the cable from the enclosure to the RM Young; and an Enclosure for the electronics interface components.  The Enclosure for the electronics interface components shall be pole mounted in the same configuration as the existing AN/FMQ-13 wind monitor. 2.0 Interface Requirements.  The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall interface to the following legacy FMQ-13 equipment: Digital Display Indicator ID-2408/FMQ-13(V) and Wind Direction and Speed Recorder RO-588/FMQ-13(V).  3.0 Accuracy Requirements.   The wind range of the wind speed sensor shall be 0-115 knots, with an accuracy of  +/-1 knot (0-24kts) and +/- 10% above 24kts.  Resolution shall be 1kt.  The wind direction accuracy shall be within 5 degrees.  The resolution shall be 10 degrees (0 to 359 degrees). The wind direction sensor shall be aligned to true north.  After removing the sensor from its mounting for maintenance, the sensor design shall enable the accurate restoration of directional alignment without the necessity for another alignment survey.  The sensors shall be sampled at a rate sufficient to provide five-second averages. 4.0 Environmental Requirements.  The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall meet the following environmental requirements: Operating Temperature: from -62 *C to +54 *C;  Storage/Transport Temperature: from -51 *C to +60 *C; Relative Humidity:  0% to 100%.;  Wind:  Up to 115 knots;  The wind speed and direction sensors shall operate within the accuracy requirements specified, during conditions of 0.25-inch radial thickness of clear ice and wind speeds higher than 10 knots.  5.0 Electromagnetic Compatibility Requirements.  The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall be electromagnetically compatible within itself and with other systems in its operating environment.  The operational performance shall not be degraded by electromagnetic environmental effects (E3).   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). This contract action represents a contract for which the Government considers that an award to any source other than Coastal Environmental Systems would likely result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements. In addition, the Contractor must be able to produce up to 30 systems a month for the life of the contract. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but rather a notice of the Government's intent. The Government intends to issue a solicitation on or about 13 August 2003.  Award of this contract will be made on or about 21 November 2003. Additional information may be obtained from the POC/Contracting Officer listed above. See Note 22.  See Note 26.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0001 issued to Solicitation Number N00421-03-T-0198 a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items.  The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions submitted by potential Offerors.  Question (1) The specification appears to be written around a Torit ECB booth.  We can comply with the requirements dimensionally.  We build our own dust collectors and cartridge collectors.  The cartridge collector was designed for utilization with this type of booth.  Do you object to a custom design job shop bidding on this project?  All replacement parts are readily available through other equipment manufacturers http://www.donaldson.com/en/industrialair/replacement/index.html and after market dealers such as http://bha.com/ as well as our own parts department.  Answer (1) No objection to custom design job shop bidding as long as the delivery date can be met.  Question (2) The minimum filter area specified is very low for the size of the booth.  The face opening is about 112 feet. I recommend that the face velocity is 200 FPM for adequate capture of particulate generated in the sanding and grinding operations.  The minimum face velocity accepted for fiberglass sanding is 120 FPM.  If the booth with clean filters performs at 200 FPM, then as the filters get dirty it will still perform above the minimum standard for some time.  The less filter area, the sooner you will cross that threshold.  Also the less filter area, the less effective the pulse system will be due to dust re-intranement on the filter surface.  Consequently, I am recommending a minimum of 8,000 square feet of filter area at 22,500 CFM total system capacity at 5" WC. I also am providing an option to upgrade to a VFD to provide energy management and the ability to overcome some dust buildup on the filters. A VFD would also provide the opportunity to slow the fan down to a low speed, this would enhance cleaning the filters.  The air to filter media ratio is still almost 3 CFM per square foot of filter. It is difficult to clean a cartridge with that much air passing through it. Slowing the fan down when the filter gets dirty would allow you to clean the filters without having the dust blowing out of the booth. If you clean the filters with the fan off, the dust will go airbourne and could escape the booth.  Answer (2) Thank you for the recommendations, however the government does not intend to change the specifications of this requirement.  Question (3) The cleaning of the filters generates a fair amount of noise. We can option an inlet acoustic baffel to shelter the employee that is in the booth from some of this noise.  The acoustic absorbers hung on the wall have little effect on the direct noise transmission.  They are very effective for the reverberation and diminish the total noise exposure by up to 5 dB within the booth.  This option is not included in our base bid.  It can be added at a later date if you wished.  Answer (3) Thank you for the recommendations, however the government does not intend to change the specifications of this requirement.  Question (4)  Please advise if there are drawings available.  Answer (4) No drawings are available.  Responsible interested parties may submit information in which they identify their interest and capability.  Quote is due to Rhoda Hall, Contract Specialist, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Building 8110, Unit 7, Villa Rd., St. Inigoes, MD 20684-0010 by 3:30 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, 31 July 2003.  The Government will not pay for any information received. Electronically submitted via email address and facsimile proposals shall be accepted.  For information regarding this solicitation or copies of FAR provision 52.212-3 contact Rhoda Hall, Code 251214, Telephone 301-995-8950 or via e-mail: Hallrg@navair.navy.mil.  If an Offeror is not able to contact the Contracting Office via e-mail, please fax correspondence/requests to the point of contact above at facsimile (301-995-8670) or telephone (301-995-8950).  There are no changes to this solicitiation.  **END SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION N00421-03-T-0198 AMENDMENT 0001.**

<DESC>17.	 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers to RFQ #3036.  This solicited document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-14.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 481219 and the small-business size standard is $6,000,000.  The International Center for Excellence in Research (ICER) is supporting the continuing research efforts of the Rakai Project in Uganda.  The Rakai Project, established in 1988, is a research and training collaboration between the Uganda Virus Research Institute/Uganda Ministry of Health; researchers at Makerere University in Kampala; Columbia University; Johns Hopkins University; and intramural scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The project operates in the rural Rakai District in Southwestern Uganda, and has established one of the largest HIV and reproductive health population-based cohorts in the world.   Currently, the cohort population is approximately 12,000 persons, aged 15-49, residing in 50 rural communities.  The project performs many research activities on HIV and STDs (HSV-2, HPV, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, Chlamydia and Trichomona, Bacterial Vaginosis/BV), including their effects on pregnancy, fertility, infant survival, placental pathology and mother-to-child HIV transmission.  To assist in this project, the NIAID is sending approximately 12,000 lbs. of laboratory materials via airfreight.  Additionally, three (3) forty (40) foot containers of laboratory materials will be shipped by sea freight.  We are seeking a shipping company – contractor that can meet the following requirements:  The shipping company must receive the freight in a warehouse (at no additional cost to the NIAID) and do a detailed inventory of each item that comes in.  The shipping company must note shortages, overages, expiration dates, voltages, and other crucial information relevant to the items that will be shipped.  The shipping company must hold the cargo at the warehouse until all items for a particular shipment have arrived and/or until the NIAID Project Officer has given them authorization to ship.  Each time that a new item is received in the warehouse, a material receipt must be sent by email to the person involved for them to check and also let him/her know what we have received.  Once the shipping company has received shipping authorization, they must assemble the items on hand and pack them into tri-wall boxes or crates in order to eliminate any potential damage.  (The choice of container is at the contractor’s discretion; however, the container must provide optimal protection at the least expense to the government.)  The contractor must do a detailed inventory of each item packed per box.  This inventory must be completely accurate to facilitate customs inspection in Uganda by enabling the customs agent to look at a specific item quickly and easily.  The contractor must pack and inventory the items in a fashion that alleviates the necessity for customs agents to search through each and every box.  If there is anything delicate in the shipment, the shipper must insure that it will not be broken in transit by using void packs or any other means necessary.  The shipper must also keep items refrigerated that need to be refrigerated, both in the warehouse before shipment and during transport. Once the items are packed, the shipper must produce a full set of documents for the shipment.  These shall include, but not be limited to, packing list, valued inventory, and commercial invoice.  The shipper must also prepare all of the export documentation such as the air waybill and the export declaration filing.  The shipper must e-mail and fax all of these documents (or whatever is stipulated by the NIAID Project Officer) to the people involved in the shipment several days prior to the shipments arrival in Uganda.  This will allow the agent in Uganda to begin the customs process; moreover, it allows the goods to be delivered in a timely manner.  The shipper must then transport the goods to the airport that they will be shipped from.  Once the shipment has left the shipper's warehouse, the contractor must trace the shipment before and after each flight.  Updates must be sent to the Project Officer accordingly.  Upon the shipments’ arrival, the shipper must contact the agent to confirm and then send confirmation to all of the parties involved.  The shipper must then stay in contact with the agent in Uganda to make sure the delivery goes smoothly.  The shipper must then send confirmation of safe passage via email to the NIAID Project Officer. The shipper must be responsible for all aspects of the shipping.  At no point should NIAID personnel be involved in getting the shipment through customs. The shipper must demonstrate at least five (5) years of experience shipping research equipment and reagents to Uganda. The government intends to make a best value buy to the responsible offeror whose offer is most advantageous to the government.  The evaluation criteria will include 1) price, 2) technical experience and 3) ability to meet the government’s delivery schedule.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition are FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items.  Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions of FAR 52.212-3, Offerors’ Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items.  Offers must be submitted not later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time, August 14, 2003.  For delivery of responses through the Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, MSC/4812, Room/2NE70D, Bethesda, MD  20817-4812.  Electronic submissions will not be accepted.  Requests for information concerning this requirement are to be addressed to Guy Baratte at (301) 594-3419.  Collect calls will not be accepted.

This is also, a Modification to correct the Federal Acquisition Circular(FAC) 2001-14, that is in the description body of this synopsis/solicitation. Federal Acquisition Circular(FAC) 2001-14 is incorrect; the correction should read, Federal Acquisition Circular(FAC) 2001-15. Please be advised; Thank You!

STATEMENT OF WORK 
For 
Insert for Spanish Language/Hispanic Newspapers and Periodicals


The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) seeks to enter into no-cost contracts for production of advertorial inserts to be published in Spanish language news periodicals or English language news periodicals targeting the Hispanic community.

The advertorials must be issued during commemoration of the agency’s 50th anniversary, between September, 2003 and September, 2004.

Background

SBA celebrates its 50th Anniversary this year and as part of the celebration will spotlight entrepreneurs from across the country. 

National recognition of the Agency’s 50th anniversary kicks off August 1 at The Dwight D. Eisenhower Library and Museum in Abilene, Kansas, where the signing of the Small Business Act by President Eisenhower on July 30, 1953 will be commemorated.  The SBA’s Web site at www.sba.gov lists the 50th anniversary events. The site will be updated regularly with new event information.  The inserts are intended to take advantage of the anniversary’s proximity to raise awareness about small business issues.

Scope

SBA plans multiple awards to contractors under which each will write, publish, and distribute a four-page minimum insert in the periodical’s circulation area.  The content of the insert must include information relevant to small businesses, tailored to local geographic interests and information about SBA’s programs and services.  The contractor must produce the insert at no cost to the U.S. government and recoup all its expenses by selling advertisements or by otherwise obtaining financial support for the project
The contractor will assign at least one person to serve as primary contact and work directly with the assigned technical representative in SBA’s Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL)to develop story ideas and content for the insert.  The contractor may use its own reporters and may also use material from other sources, for which it has obtained appropriate rights.    The contractor must submit a final mock-up of the insert, including ads, to the technical representative for SBA’s approval before publication.  SBA may edit the content as it sees fit.

The contractor is responsible for any necessary translation into Spanish.  For material prepared exclusively in Spanish, the contractor must be prepared, if necessary, to furnish English translation to SBA’s technical representative.

The contractor must receive all funds directly and pay all expenses, including any cost overruns, associated with the writing, production, and distribution of the insert.  The contractor will be responsible for all costs and logistics of creating the insert, including production, design, promotion, marketing, advertising and distribution in the markets served by contractor publications.

In addition to the writing, publication, and distribution of the insert, the contractor must print extra copies, in a number to be set out in the proposal, subject to negotiation..  The contractor must  distribute the copiesto SBA’s field offices, SCORE chapters, SBDCs, WBCs, and SBA lending partners in the publication’s circulation area.  

Requirements

The contractor need not be a publisher of a newspaper or periodical.  However, if it is not a publisher, it must demonstrate in its proposal that it has made distribution arrangements with a Spanish language newspaper or periodical, or another periodical oriented towards the Hispanic community.  .

The insert must be distributed in a news oriented print newspaper or magazine.  Periodicals consisting primarily of paid advertising instead of editorial content are not eligible.

Deliverables

The deliverables will consist of a four-page minimum insert, distributed as set out above.

Period of Performance

The contractor may propose any distribution date between September, 2003 and September, 2004.

Basis for Award

SBA plans to accept all technically acceptable proposals from responsible contractors, except to avoid duplication in a particular market.  SBA plans to award without discussions unless discussions could prove advantageous in a particular circumstance.  To avoid duplication, if SBA receives two or more approximately equal proposals covering overlapping circulation areas, it reserves the right to hold discussions and to negotiate acceptable publication dates, numbers of copies, and general areas of content prior to award.

The evaluation factors in section M of the solicitation will be used both to determine whether a proposal is technically acceptable and, if necessary, to choose among proposals in a geographic area.

SBA’s cooperation

SBA will:  
•	provide a welcome letter from SBA Administrator Hector V. Barreto for the insert; 
•	provide access to SBA officials and other personnel employed by SBA for interviews and information for the insert articles;
•	provide the contractor with use of SBA’s logo and the SBA’s 50th anniversary logo for limited purposes; 
•	permit the contractor to claim copyright in original material;
•	permit the contractor to identify itself in the insert; 
•	serve as an advisor and information source for the editorial content of the product, 
•	assign at least one staff person to work with contractor,
•	meet all production deadlines as provided by contractor,
•	identifying experts and successful small businesses as appropriate in the markets served by both the SBA and the contractor, and
•	have final approval of the final draft insert, including advertising, prior to printing.

Evaluation Factors

•	Experience of the offeror in writing and publishing similar content.
•	(If the contractor is not a publisher):  Experience of the distributor.
•	Ability of the distribution network to reach the intended audience.
•	Quality of previous publications.  (If applicable).
•	(If translating):  Experience of the translators.
•	Understanding of business issues of interest to the Hispanic community in the area to be served by the publication.
•	[If more than one in a market area and more than one proposes similar content or publication schedules]:  The ability of the offeror to reach the target audience.

<DESC>The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Professor  John U. Ogbu, Chancellor's Professor of Anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley.  OCR seeks to employ Professor Ogbu as an expert in the academic achievement of immigrant and non-immigrant minorities and through a comparative ethnographic research study provide an explanation as to why the two types of minorities differ in academic orientation and performance.  The services would provide valuable insight into the difficulties faced by minorities and look at the dynamic within the minority community of what is called "community" forces.  As a result of this research, OCR will be able to use the information as a technical assistance tool in improving the academic performance of minority children by working with parents, schools and community leaders to take into account the effects of  "community" forces.  In an effort to secure expert consultant assistance, we have competed research over the web of University professors who have  expertise,  and were unable to find anyone with the extensive knowledge and background.  SPECIFIC TASKS:  Extensive ethnographic date has been collected on Black Americans, Chinese Americans and Mexican Americans to find out what these groups thought or believed about education and why immigrants seem to be more successful than the non-immigrants in performing academically.  Recently similar data has been collected in Asian countries, namely China and Japan, where similar minorities exist, particularly non-immigrant minorities, such as the Burakumin and Koreans in Japan.   The proposed work consists of a translation of the Asian data, including the Japanese and some Chinese data, into English.  This data will then be analyzed and a comparison report of both the American groups and the Asian groups will be written and provided to the Office for Civil Rights.  Included in the report will be recommendations, based on the research, as to how the Office for Civil Rights may incorporate the findings into improving the academic performance of minority children taking into account the dynamics within the minority of what is called "community" forces.  RESOURCES: The work will be a fixed price purchase order.  Incumbent will conduct the research off site. The research team will consist of a principal investigator, a translator and a clerical assistant.  PERFORMANCE DATE: The beginning date for work would commence on or about September 15, 2003, and extend to August 31, 2004.  DELIVERABLES:  During the contractual period, work would be continuous but intermitten. However, it is anticipated that services may be required for several conference calls and meetings with OCR staff as well as officials of other offices within ED and other government agencies.  The Office for Civil Rights will be billed incrementally in three phases:   1) Upon the completion of the translation of the Asian date; 2) Upon the completion of the analysis; and 3) Upon receipt of the research report.  At the end of each phase, incumbent will submit an invoice to the Office for Civil Rights, 330 C Street, SW, Attn:  Rebecca Hucks, Washington, DC 20202.  The invoice will state the number of hours worked and the hourly rate of the individuals completing the work and a list of expenses for supplies and computing services.  Payment will be made within 30 days of receipt of the invoice.  ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: The contractor and its employees, agents, and subcontractors shall not use and shall maintain confidentially of any information, report or other work produced or knowledge gained under the contract until such time as such information, reports, or work product is released by the Department into the public domain and becomes publicly available information. The Government may withhold from the amount of the contract any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the Government against loss as a result of the contractor not maintaining confidentially of any information, report or other work produced or knowledge gained under the contract.  SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:  The Office for Civil Rights seeks to employ Professor John U. Ogbu as an expert in the academic achievement of immigrant and non-immigrant minorities and through a comparative ethnographic research study provide an explanation as to why the two types of minorities differ in academic orientation and performance.   His services would provide valuable insight into the difficulties faced by minorities and look at the dynamic within the minority community of what is called "community" forces.  As a result of this research, OCR will be able to use the information as a technical assistance tool in improving the academic performance of minority children by working with parents, schools and community leaders to take into account the effects of  "community" forces.  In an effort to secure expert consultant assistance, we have competed research over the web of University professors who have similar expertise as Dr. Ogbu and were unable to find anyone with his extensive knowledge and background.  Dr. Ogbu is the only expert who has conducted research in the area and he has written extensively about collective identity and the efforts on minorities.    Professor Ogbu is the author of several books and more than 90 articles on these issues and is widely referenced and quoted by academic scholars working in the fields of education and educational anthropology.  SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE OF EXPERT REQUIRED:  John U. Ogbu, Chancellor's Professor of Anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley and one of the world's leading educational anthropologists.  His recent field of studies were conduced in Oakland and Union City, California on African Americans, Chinese Americans and Mexican Americans and in an affluent suburban community in Ohio.  He research focus is on the relationship between collective identity and cultural/language boundaries.  His focus is on the sense of "we-feeling" and "belongingness" within cultural minority groups.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The service shall begin with a three (3) month Test and Demonstration (T&D) period on or about September 1, 2003 through November 30, 2003 under Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 1.  In the event that the T&D is deemed successful by the BBG/IBB, the Government may exercise  Option CLIN 2, subject to the availability of funding, to begin performance commencing on December 1, 2003 through August 31, 2004.  However, in the event that the T&D is deemed unsuccessful, CLIN 2 will not be exercised and service will terminate and the Government will have no further obligation or commitment to continue.  This contract will also include six (6) option years as noted below.  Each Option year is contingent upon the availability of funds.  The Option Years are under CLIN's 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.

Neighborhood:  Proposals shall contain information on the proposed MCPC carrier to be used for the BBG/IBB transmission with a list of broadcasters that share or are planned to share the same MCPC carrier.  Objectionable broadcasters (i.e., pornography, racists, etc.) are prohibited.  Connectivity:  The Contractor shall be able to receive the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) transmission from both the Atlantic Ocean Region (AOR) New Skies 319.5 Degree East Satellite, West to West Hemi/West to East Spot (Europe) C-Band Transponder 17/17 (2.4 to 3.0 Meter or Larger, Circular Polarization (CP), antenna required in most areas) and the AOR Intelsat 332.5 Degree East Satellite, West to East Hemi C-Band Transponder 11/21 (4.8 Meter or Larger Circular Polarization (CP) antenna required).

The calculation is as follows: Total Contract Monthly Cost divided by 30 Days = Cost Per Day, Cost Per Day divided by 24 hours = Cost Per Hour, Cost Per Hour divided by 60 = Cost Per Minute, Cost Per Minute times Interruption Period Duration in Minutes = Rebate.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in 
accordance (IAW) with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included with this notice. This commercial item acquisition is being conducted IAW FAR Part 13.106-2 and 13.5. A written solicitation will not be issued.  This announcement constitutes the Request for Quote (RFQ).  The solicitation number is DTCG23-03-Q-OPD03.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15 Correction. This RFQ is a Small Business set-aside. The applicable NAICS is 334516 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The Coast Guard (CG) will issue a single  Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ.  The IDIQ contract will be effective for 60 months starting as of the date of award.  The minimum guarantee is $300,000 and the maximum value of the contract is $5,000,000.  The IDIQ will include firm-fixed-prices for  Radiation Detection Back Packs. The CG requirements are as follows.  The sensor must allow USCG personnel to search for and locate concealed sources of radioactive and special nuclear materials that could be used in either a radiological dispersion device (RDD) or an improvised nuclear device (IND).  The device must be designed to allow USCG personnel to quickly detect and locate a radiation threat in an unpredictable natural radiation background.  When gamma rays or neutrons are detected at levels above the natural background the device must quickly alert the operator.  Users should be able to operate the sensor with minimal training and/or experience.  User should be able to pick up the monitor, use it, only replace batteries and not have to worry about maintenance such as calibration or replacement of sensors.   The primary intended use of these detectors is to serve as a means to search large areas, detect and locate sources of radioactive material by USCG personnel while conducting typical USCG missions.  The projected operating environment (POE) includes extremely harsh maritime conditions as well as many different types of vessels including but not limited to cargo (break-bulk, bulk, container, etc.), passenger, fishing, and private recreational vessels.  Environmental conditions also include high noise, high vibration, wide and constantly changing temperature and humidity.  The maritime environment also presents many sources of electro-magnetic interference (EMI) as well as unusual levels of natural background radiation.  In addition to other parameters, the offered detector must be able to minimize false alarms that may be caused by EMI and or unusual natural background.  USCG operations often require climbing; as such the detector must be lightweight and compact.  Any control or display must be configured to provide the operator with easy access while the detector is worn on the operator’s back.  The carrying pack should be padded and ergonomically designed to minimize fatigue of the user.  When worn, the pack must minimize interferences to USCG personnel while maneuvering through a vessel.  CG personnel ranging from highly skilled technical experts to our least experienced, most junior personnel will use this sensor.  The training required to proficiently operate the sensor must be of minimal impact to the CG. Performance Specifications are as follows: 1. Features/Functions:1.1. Detect the presence of thermal neutron radiation and gamma rays at levels above the natural background in large areas,1.2. Detect the presence of gamma rays; 2.  Physical Characteristics: 2.1. Capable of operating in harsh marine environmental conditions, 2.2. Lightweight and compact, minimize interference to USCG personnel movements and agility during the performance of duties, 2.2.1. Desired weight – less than 15 lbs, 2.2.2. Desired dimensions-approximately 15 inches wide, 20 inches tall, 12 inches thickness, 2.3. Waterproof and padded to limit damage and interference from vibration and incidental impacts, 2.4. Power supply – battery, 2.4.1. Battery lifetime – equal to or greater than 40 hours of continuous use, 2.5 Alarms, 2.5.1. The detector must have a minimum of two (2) means of alarm to include visual and audible, 2.5.2. Alarms should be easily seen and heard, even when hearing protection by user and others around them; 3. Sensor: 3.1 Gamma detector – Cesium Iodide scintillator, 3.2 Neutron detector – Helium-3, 3.3 Response time – less than one (1) second, 3.4 Operating temperature range-greater than or equal to 5°F to 120°F, 3.5 Storage temperature range – (greater than or equal to) -10°F to 120°F, 4. Lifespan/Maintenance/Warranty: 4.1 Sensor to function for minimum of two years, 4.2 Zero maintenance other than battery change out, 4.3 Desired warranty is two years 4.4 Warranty coverage should include, but not be limited to defects in parts and/or workmanship and failures occurring during the course on normal and intended use; 5. Training-Vendor must provide instruction and training on the proper use and maintenance of the detector.  Offerors must provide Firm Fixed Unit Price for the Radiation Detection Back Pack. The estimated quantity over the life of the contract is 95 units.  The Government desired delivery is 30 days after receipt of a order (ARO). Required delivery is 90 days ARO. Interested parties may obtain a comprehensive list of anticipated delivery destinations by faxing a request to (202) 267-4019, ATTN: Pamela Bible, or may e-mail a request to pbible@comdt.uscg.mil.  Inspection shall be in accordance with FAR 52.247-34 --F.O.B. Destination.  Packing and packaging shall be in accordance with commercial practice to assure delivery at destination.  Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors — Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Offerors attention is drawn to (10) past performance.  Contractors should provide past performance information on contracts in which the intended use of the item was in a maritime environment.  Past performance data is limited to three contracts.  Offerors should submit warranty information, as well as appropriate information on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness of the price. Quotes may be submitted via email, facsimile or mailed.  If mailed, please include 2 copies of your quote. A comparative evaluation of quotes will be conducted on Technical, Past Performance and Price.  Technical is more important than past performance and price.  Past performance and price are equal in importance.  Total evaluated price will be calculated by multiplying unit prices by the total estimated quantity of 95. Offerors must include a completed copy of provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items Alt I, with their quote.  Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, is incorporated by reference into the solicitation.

Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, is incorporated by reference into this solicitation.  The following FAR clauses cited in 52.212-5(b) are applicable to this contract: 1;5; 11;12;13;14;15;16;17;18;21;22;24.  The 52-519-6 is incorporated by reference as addenda to 52.212-5. Quotes are due no later than 2:00 p.m. on  August 13, 2003  in Room 5222 at the address listed above.  An electronic version of the synopsis may be requested via email.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation. Potential offerors who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the offeror should then contract the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the following address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)/2100 Second Street, SW/Washington, DC/20593-000l/Ph: (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential offerors should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and the solicitation closing date.
