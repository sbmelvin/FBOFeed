<DESC>This project is being solicited on an unrestricted basis.  This procurement is open for responses from all firms.  We plan to select two firms from this solicitation.  However, small business contractors will have first priority.  (The small business size standard North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is "541330", $4.0 million annual average).  The work associated with this Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDQ) for Miscellaneous Architectural Design and Engineering Services with associated multi-disciplinal engineering support services includes various studies and the preparation of construction documents via alternative documentation methods, (such as, Design-Bid-Build plans and specifications and Design-Build), ready for bidding for various projects at various locations in the Engineering Field Activity (EFA) Chesapeake region - Washington DC, VA and MD.  Work may be performed for the Public Works Center, Naval District Washington, also.  The type of work primarily includes designs for new construction, repairs, renovations, and alterations of facilities.  Work typically includes the following: complete facility programming and design development for new and renovation facilities.  In addition, work may typically include roofing systems, flooring systems, ceiling systems, interior and exterior partitions, millwork, office furniture systems, signage, interior and exterior finishes, windows, doors, skylights, insulation, vertical transportation, (stairs, elevators, and lifts and ramps), and building demolition.  Work may include facility related security systems, information/communications systems, electrical distribution systems, lighting systems, fire protection and alarm systems, mechanical systems, plumbing systems, and utility and site improvements.  Site improvements include stormwater management, landscaping, parking, sidewalks, etc.  Work may include pest damage analyses.  All relative project requirements must be Y2K compliant.  Familiarity with Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) requirements is required.  Familiarity with Sustainable Design through an integrated design approach is required.  Familiarity with the Success Cost Estimating System is required.  Interior design services are required - familiarity with mandatory sources of procurement, i.e., Federal prison Industries (FPI), GSA schedules, etc. is required.  Familiarity with the metric system of measurement is required.  The possibility of hazardous materials, i.e., asbestos, lead, lead paint, PCB's, and other hazardous materials may exist at various project sites. Petroleum containing soil may exist at various project sites.  If these materials or other similar types of material are encountered, the A/E Contractor may be required to conduct hazardous material removal surveys, including testing and sampling, provide design removal procedures and prepare construction documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such materials.  All hazardous materials licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project site are required by the A/E firm or their subcontractors.  The general intention is to provide for such design and engineering services as necessary to support the procurement of these contacts. For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as technical reports, studies, site investigations, programming of client requirements, concept designs, construction documents for design-bid-build and design-build, parametric construction cost estimates (PCE), complete construction cost estimates, surveys, assistance in source selection technical panel reviews (Design Evaluations Teams), shop drawings reviews, construction consultation and inspection, Title II, preparation of construction record drawings, and O&M manuals, may be required at any time up to final acceptance of all work.  The selected A/E contractor for the contract will be required to provide overhead, profit, and discipline hourly rates initially to the Contracting Officer within 10 days after receiving notification.  In addition, the selected A/E contractor will be required to participate in orientation and site visit meetings (when requested) within five days of notification for each project and provide a fee proposal for each project within ten days after receiving the Request for Proposal and Scope of Work.  Service for each project will be a firm fixed price A/E contract.  The maximum duration of each contract will be for the period of 5 years.  The total contract amount will not exceed $5 million. Architectural and engineering services for these contracts will be subject to the availability of funds.  The estimated start is June 2002.  The Architectural and Engineering firms shall respond directly to each of the selection criteria shown below. Selection evaluation criteria included in relative order of importance are: 1.a. Specialized experience and professional qualifications of the firm, including subcontractors, and the proposed project team (the team/office actually accomplishing the work) in providing complete architectural services with multi-disciplinal engineering support services for the design methods and requirements described herein; b. Knowledge and demonstrated experiences in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure through an integrated design approach. c. Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) techniques; 2.a. Demonstrated capabilities in accomplishment of work within established time limits for multiple and simultaneous delivery orders; b. Status of the firm's and project team's present workload; 3. Past performance and process of the prime A/E firm (and their subcontractors) in their quality control/quality assurance program to assure coordinated technically accurate plans, specifications, and construction cost estimates; 4. Preference will be given to firms with the demonstrated capability of using CAD, SPECSINTACT, and the Success Cost Estimating System.  Each firm's past performance(s) and performance ratings will be reviewed during the evaluation process and can affect the selection outcome.  Firms that meet the requirements listed in this announcement are invited to submit one copy each of the completed Standard Forms (SF) 254 and SF 255, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, to the office indicated below.  Site visits will not be arranged during the advertisement period.  Interested firms are requested to include telefax numbers, DUNS number, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) on the SF 255 and SF 254 in Blocks 3 and 1, respectively.  Interested firms are also requested to include their A/E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS) number on the SF 255 in Block 3.  In Block 10, state why your firm is specially qualified based on the selection evaluation criteria.  Also, use Block 10 to provide additional information desired by your firm.  Only the SF 254 and SF 255 will be reviewed.  Experiences identified in Block 8 should not be more than 5 years old.  The A/E firm's primary person proposed to be the direct contact with EFA CHES throughout the contract work must be identified as the "Project Manager".  Information in the cover letter and any other attachments will not be included in the official selection review process.  Submit the SF 254 and 255 to the mailroom in the EFA CHES building, Building 212, by 3:30 p.m. on the established due date.  Hand delivery or overnight delivery is highly recommended.  Fax and electronic copies of the SF 254 and 255 will not be accepted.  This is not a request for proposal.  Because this contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000.00, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns.  The small disadvantaged business goal in that subcontracting plan shall not be less than 5% of the subcontracted work.  This goal of not less than 5% also applies to women-owned small business concerns.  A subcontracting plan is not required from firms classified as a small business.  Effective 1 October 1997, A/E contractors are now required to register their firms in the Central Contractor Registration database prior to receiving a contract award.  This database provides basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government and complies with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which requires Federal agencies to have the Taxpayer Identification Number of every contractor and to pay every contractor through electronic funds transfer.  A/E contractors will only have to provide this information once with annual updates or as key company information changes occur.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.acq.mil/ec; through any DOD Certified Value Added Network; or a paper may be obtained by calling the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.  Provide SF 254 and SF 255 packages to: Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Engineering Field Activity Chesapeake (Attn: Code CH23 - Randolph Jones), Washington Navy Yard, Building 212, 1314 Harwood St., SE, Washington, DC 20374-5018.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-PRDA-02-08-IFKA
<CONTACT>Joetta Bernhard, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-2308, Fax (315) 330-7790, Email Joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil
<DESC>CONTACT: Contracting Officer, Joetta Bernhard, (315) 330-2308, email: Joetta.Bernhard@afrl.af.mil. AFRL/IFEC Program Managers and Technical Points of Contact: Mr. Scott F. Adams, (315) 330-1430, email: Scott.Adams@afrl.af.mil; Mr. Richard J. Simard, (315) 330-4104, e-mail: Richard.Simard@afrl.af.mil. Introduction: The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and advanced technology development in Digital Data Embedding Technologies (DDET): information hiding, steganography, watermarking, steganalysis, embedded data extraction, digital data forensics, etc. Information hiding and data embedding refer to secure addition of information content to digital data products using mathematical techniques which work at the constructive level of the product. Steganography refers to the use of data embedding for covert communication. Watermarking refers to embedding additional information about the cover data. Steganalysis detects the presence of steganographic communications. Embedded data extraction refers to the extrication of hidden information. Digital data forensics refers to analysis that gathers evidence of data composition, origin, pedigree, etc. The primary digital data types of interest include imagery, video and audio. This program will develop, employ and exploit digital data embedding technologies to provide early demonstrations for potential applications to operational DoD systems. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a vehicle for continued development over its duration.  Objective:  DDET technologies have shown great potential to contribute to the defense information architecture in the areas of information assurance, authentication, augmentation, and protection. This procurement will assist the government in the technical development of DDET technologies, for evaluation and selection of transitionable technologies, and in prototype demonstrations of these technologies into appropriate systems. These systems could include the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) , the Combined Air Operations Center - Experimental (CAOC-X),  systems at the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) and National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC), and/or others as applicable.
Technical Background: The Air Force Research Laboratory Multi-Sensor Exploitation Branch has fostered DDET research & development for the past several years. For the most part, this has been done with small university grants, small business and dual use contracts, etc. The results have been widely briefed, well-received, and show great potential for providing many new revolutionary information technologies. Selected advances have begun transition to prototypes, to the extent made possible by funding. It is believed that this PRDA will provide the means to effectively enact accelerated future research,development, test, and evaluation, and ultimately result in more rapid DDET technology insertion.  Innovative DDET Research and Development White Paper Solicitation: AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that provide innovative DDET research and development.  Awards:  Multiple awards for the DDET White Paper initiative are anticipated. The principal funding and the anticipated awards as a result of this PRDA will start in 4Q FY02, and will be in the form of contracts, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending on the nature of the work proposed. Contractor teaming is encouraged. Individual awards will normally range from 6 to 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $25,000 to $1,000,000 for basic research and prototype development, and $500,000 to $2,000,000 for advanced technology development and integration efforts.  AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA. Deliverables will be technical reports, prototype applications, software and  integrated system enhancements andupgrades.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished using the following criteria: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) offerors capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost and fee realism and reasonableness. In addition, the Government will consider other factors such as, past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the described effort. Experience with, and access to, DDET migration systems will be considered when said migration systems are integral to the proposed work. Criteria 1 through 4 above will also be used to determine whether White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government. White paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submittals/awards under this PRDA. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  No minimum facility clearance, safeguarding capability, or personnel clearances are necessary; however, these could be required based upon the offeror's proposed role and contribution.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit an unclassified original plus (3) copies of their White Papers for the DDET PRDA to AFRL/IFEC, ATTN: Scott Adams, Ref. PRDA 02-08-IFKA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114 no earlier than 17 May 2002. White Papers are limited to a total page count of ten (10) pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. A softcopy of the white paper in Microsoft Word must also be provided. White Papers must contain a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned small, or HUBZone small business, or a Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution. The White Paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their White Papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). Multiple White Papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.  It is recommended that White Papers be received early in each Fiscal Year to maximize the possibility of award. However, White Papers will be accepted at any time, but it is more likely that funding will be available during the early portion of each Fiscal Year. The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA. Those White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award. White Papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  The total value for all awards under this PRDA shall not exceed $24,000,000. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, AFRL/IFKA, ATTN:  Joetta Bernhard, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, New York, 13441-4514, or phone (315) 330-2308 for information if they contemplate responding.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. Routine questions are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be e-mailed directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, at: (315) 330-2308. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Linda W. Reed, Deputy Chief, Contracting Division, AFRL/IFK at (315) 330-7748. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or in the source selection process.  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY02-30 Jun 2002; FY03-30 Jun 2003; FY04-30 Jun 2004.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each fiscal year after the dates cited.  This PRDA is open and effective until 30 September 2004.  A copy of the AFRL/IFK publication, "BAA & PRDA: a Guide For Industry", Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at:  http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  All responsible firms may submit proposals or White Papers, as appropriate, which shall be considered. Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 02-08-IFKA. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

Time set for CBE 5977 is February 6, 2002 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  For the sake of consistency and to avoid confusion, this solicitation will similarly refer to such action as a CBE.

Rather, this solicitation is being conducted under the procedures set forth as FAR Part 15. During the CBE, offerors will provide pricing through submission of electronic offers via software that will be provided by FreeMarkets.  The primary pricing competition for this solicitation will be through the online reverse auction. FreeMarkets will explain this process in detail and train each qualified offeror prior to the CBE.  Offerors will have the ability to submit revised pricing during the CBE in response to prices submitted by other offerors.  The identity of offerors will not be revealed to each other during the CBE.  The final such revision during the CBE will be considered the offeror?s final proposal.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to factors other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  During the CBE, offerors may revise their price proposals through submission of electronic offers during anonymous CBE.  This CBE shall constitute discussions with the offerors.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to suspend or cancel the CBE at any time.  If the Contracting Officer cancels the CBE, Final Proposal Revisions will be requested by an amendment to the solicitation.  Notwithstanding FAR 52.215, offerors will submit pricing only through the online mechanism supplied by FreeMarkets.  Offerors will not submit pricing via any other mechanism including but not limited to post, courier, fax, e-mail or orally unless specifically requested by the Contracting Officer.  At the conclusion of the CBE, UNICOR intends to award the contract, to the eligible, best-valued, responsible offeror.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to award to other than the low-priced offeror or to make no award under the solicitation. Further information about the CBE is provided on UNICOR?s Website.  Offerors may also contact Chris Nonevski, Associate Market Maker, at FreeMarkets at (412) 297-8554 with specific questions about the CBE and forms and attachments.  Interested offerors must register for CBE 5977 at FreeMarkets.com and must accept the online ?Offeror Agreement? in order to participate.  Any amendments hereby issued to this solicitation shall be synopsized in the same manner as this solicitation and must be acknowledged by each offeror.

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors, International Broadcasting Bureau (BBG/IBB), Office of Contracts (M/CON), has a requirement for a single 3.0 MVA, 69 kV / 2.4 kV, 3 phase, 50 Hz, power transformer for the electrical substation at its Thailand Transmitting Station which is located 50 miles north of Bangkok, Thailand.  There will be no installation, on-site supervision, or overseas support services required.  Optional Contract Line Items may include : (a) remote monitoring and control equipment; (b) spare parts; and (c) on-site technical engineering support for a factory trained technician to commission, test, and startup the transformer at the Transmitting Station.  The Contractor shall pack, crate as a complete shipment (no partials), protect all equipment for overseas shipment, and deliver the equipment FOB to the Port of Bangkok, Thailand, consigned to the United States Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand.  The Government will be responsible for all Port and Customs clearing and further shipment to the site near Bangkok.  Note that shipments consigned to the U.S. Embassy are not subject to third party inspections [e.g., Societe Generale de Surveilllance (SGS)].  In addition, there are no local (Thailand) clearing or transportation costs.  The Government will take conditional acceptance of the equipment upon inspection at the Port of Bangkok.  Final acceptance will be upon installation, commissioning, and final testing of the equipment.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: (a) Technical capability of the offered equipment to meet the Government's requirements as stated in the Solicitation (i.e., all equipment shall be rated for 50 Hz operation, be the manufacturer's standard design, and shall comply with all applicable United States criteria, including but not limited to, ANSI, ASTM, IEEE, NEMA, UL, etc.);  (b) past performance (i.e., the manufacturer shall have at least 5 years experience building the type of equipment specified to the basic specification);  and (c) firm-fixed-price including options and proposed shipping price to the Port of Bangkok, Thailand.  Technical and past performance, when combined, are of equal importance when compared to the Offeror's proposed firm-fixed-price.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of option prices shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  The Government intends  to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation for this negotiated firm-fixed-price procurement in April 2002, with a proposal response date of 21 calendar days after the RFP release date.  Per FAR Subpart 5.203 (b), the Contracting Officer has determined this to be a reasonable response time for acquisition of this commercial item.  Offerors interested in receiving a copy of the RFP must respond in writing to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Gary Hosford via facsimile at (202) 260-0855, or E-mail at ghosford@IBB.gov, or via letter to the above-listed address not later than 10 calendar days after the publishing date of this Notice.  Per FAR Subpart 5.203 (a) (1), the Contracting Officer has established a 10 day period for issuance of the Solicitation.  Please reference Solicitation Number BBGCON-3602-S5295 on all correspondence regarding this notice.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate a sole source contract with AeroVironment, Incorporated, Monrovia, California.  This contract is to procure (350) each Dragon Eye Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Lithium Sulfur Di-Oxide (LiSO2) Primary Flight Batteries.  Although the components of the batteries are generally Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items, the battery's component integration (design and weight), and the aircraft to battery interface specifications that enable proper battery operation in the AeroVironment Incorporated Dragon Eye UAV are considered proprietary to AeroVironment Incorporated.   The battery requires specific voltage protection and regulation to meet AeroVironment's Dragon Eye UAV power consumption requirements.  The battery also requires exact placement of the connector and connector type that couples the battery to the AeroVironment Dragon Eye UAV.  The design and placement of the battery also cannot affect the Center of Gravity (CG) of the AeroVironment, Incorporated Dragon Eye UAV.

<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs intends to modify an existing GSA blanket purchase agreement no. OJP-2001-134-BF with Aspen Systems Corporation on a sole source basis.  This modification will include meeting planning and logistical support services necessary to carry out the Drug Courts Program Office (DCPO) National Drug Court Training and Technical Assistance Program for FY02 through November 30, 2002.   This program includes the Drug Court Planning Initiative (DCPI) and the Drug Court Training Initiative (DCTI), a total of 71 events.  This action is taken under the authority of  FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The services required  are estimated at up to 24,605 hours level of effort.  Other direct costs for travel and diem reimbursement, supplies, postage, shipping,  hotel sleeping and meeting rooms, food and beverage, and audio-visual requirements during the 71 events nationwide are estimated to be over fifty percent of the total funding requirement.  These services have been provided to date under contract OJP-99-C-002, National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS), a cost reimbursement contract that expires November 30, 2002.   The contractor, Aspen Systems Corporation, has agreed to provide these same services under the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule blanket purchase agreement (BPA) at a significantly lower total overhead rate to save OJP significant funds.   Many of the hotel subcontracts have already been signed by Aspen Systems and others are being negotiated.  The hotels cannot be changed as the schedule has been announced and invitations have been mailed and attendees have already booked reservations and made travel plans.  This is not a solicitation and no solicitation document will be prepared.  Interested GSA marketing and media schedule vendors may submit a capability statement and/or price quote for these commercial services within 4 working days (March 19) which shall be considered by the agency.  The agency intends to compete the FY03 requirements among four or more GSA schedule 738 vendors before September 30, 2002.

<DESC>The Virginia Contracting Activity, on behalf of the Defense Intelligence Agency/ Missile and Space Intelligence Center (DIA/MSIC), Building 4545, Fowler Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5500 intends to award a purchase order to Mississippi State University.  The objective of the effort is to have the contractor perform a computational aerodynamic analysis of a subsonic missile with side exhaust plumes that interact with tail control surfaces.  The analysis shall be performed using U2NCLE, an unstructured tetrahedral body fitted grid Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code that can model plume exhaust effects.  These simulations are intended to provide insight into the impact of viscous effects, plume interaction, and grid resolution on aerodynamic performance prediction accuracy.  The contractor shall:  a.  construct an unstructured body fitted computational grid with emphasis on capturing the effect of plume characteristics on missile performance; b. determine the optimal grid resolution by performing a grid refinement study; c. perform calculations with and without plume exhaust for one rotation rate, one Mach number, and two angles of attack to be specified by the Government...this will involve a total of four cases; examine the flowfields and visually display relevant parameters influencing aerodynamic performance; quantify the impact of the plume exhaust on aerodynamic performance by determining the forces and moments acting on the missile; d.  document the results of the analysis; discuss the impact of plume exhaust on predicting the aerodynamic performance of subsonic missiles with tail controls and include computational requirements.  This effort will require three 1-day, 1-person trips to Huntsville, Alabama.  The contractor shall have twelve months to perform the requirements of this effort.  All documentation shall be assembled in Microsoft Word or [Acrobat (Portable Document Format) and HTML (HyperText Markup Language)] with graphics, data and text placed together.  The final report shall be in both hardcopy and CD-ROM.  It will also be necessary for the contractor to provide monthly cost and progress reports by email. No solicitations shall be issued other than this notice. Only those proposals received by the MSIC contracts office by March 29, 2002 shall be considered. Direct all contractual questions to Donna Tignor at 256-313-7625.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with the International Wildlife Center (IWC), to expand a previous vessel use survey and to provide technical assistance and expert advice on marine mammal issues.   A vessel use survey requires making observations of vessels and fishing gear which sometimes involves subjective interpretations.  It is important in this type of study to decrease observer error by using the same methodology and personnel from the previous study.  The Contractor will coordinate and facilitate research on vessel uses within SBNMS as well as the possible influences of vessels on marine mammals. These new studies focus on the key issues of vessel speed and acoustic pollution.  The IWC is in a unique position to initiate these studies rapidly and cost effectively by replicating the previous methodology.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Period of performance will be 6/01/02 through 5/30/03 with one year option period.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of  their capability to respond to the requirement by April 12, 2002.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

"B" - All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified below for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer an Ombudsman has been appointed  to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Ms Kim McDonald, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.  "F" - This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017- 3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice.  Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

<DESC>The Chemical and Physical Carcinogenesis Branch (CPCB), Division of Cancer Biology (DCB) of the National Cancer Institute, has a continuing requirement for "The Registry of Tumors in Lower Animals."  The objective of this contract is to continue to build, maintain and disseminate information in the Registry of Tumors in Lower Animals (RTLA), a unique registry on neoplasms in lower animals, which facilitates the study of  neoplasia and related diseases in invertebrate and cold blooded vertebrate animals by providing expert pathologic evaluation of specimens submitted  from all over the world.  The RTLA serves as a clearinghouse and diagnostic center for information on pathology of fishes, other lower vertebrates and invertebrates.  The RTLA not only accessions tumor material representative of the more than 20,000 species of fishes but also makes available slides, tissue blocks and an extensive bibliographic library of research papers dealing with tumors in lower animals for investigators working on the etiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of tumors.  The Registry is in the unique position to identify significant types and clusters of lower animal cancers from among the many specimens donated for diagnosis and archiving.  Through its varied activities the Registry 1) serves to correct or prevent misdiagnoses and misinformation, 2)  find cheaper or more efficient carcinogen bioassays, 3) discover  oncogenic viruses and their vectors, 4) elucidate the function of new or unknown genes found activated in lower animal cancers, 5) help understand the basic mechanisms of neoplastic transformation by studying the behavior of cancer in simpler animal systems, and above all, 6)  advance our understanding of the genetic, cellular, and physiologic mechanisms for cancer development.  For the last five years the RTLA has been operated under contract N01-CB-77021 to the George Washington University Medical Center, Department of Pathology. This acquisition has now been designated as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside under NAICS code No. 541990.  The CPCB plans to award a single, incrementally funded, cost-reimbursement type contract for a five year period.  The anticipated solicitation issue date is approximately 15 days after publication of this notice and proposals will be due approximately 30 days after the issue date.  The RFP may be accessed through the Research Contracts Acquisition Branch Home Page by using the following Internet address:  http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/.  IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.

Description

GSA'S NATIONAL TRAVEL FORUM 2002 EXCELLENCE IN GOVERNMENT TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION.  The National Travel Forum 2002:  Excellence in Government Travel and Transportation  (NTF 2002) will be held June 17-20, 2002, at the Opryland Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee.  NTF 2002 is co-sponsored by the U. S. General Services Administration's Office of Governmentwide Policy, the Interagency Travel Management Committee (a forum of approximately 100 Federal travel, transportation and financial policy managers), and the Government Executive magazine.

NTF 2002's mission is to provide a forum for travel, transportation and other professionals within Federal, State, and local governments, as well as the private sector, to network and explore best practices on travel and transportation issues.  Nearly 1500 attendees will join us at NTF 2002.  Much of this year's focus will be on travel and transportation safety, electronic travel, the Federal Premier Lodging Program and revised travel and relocation rules, e.g., a new law that authorizes Federal employees to retain frequent traveler benefits and other promotional items earned on official travel.  We will also be looking at best practices in Government travel and transportation, including retirement of the Government Bill of Lading (GBL) and adoption of Commercial Bills of Lading (CBLs), implementation of order entry systems and unique numbering systems, as well as a full range of other travel and transportation-related topics.  Participants will explore innovations and continued improvements in travel and transportation.  Additionally, NTF 2002 is providing free space to hold agency-wide meetings.  Don't miss this unique opportunity to attend and exhibit!  To register, visit the web site at www.nationaltravel2002.org.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 5 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR 1 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS WALK-IN FREEZER DESIGNED WITH A BASE THAT IS AN INDEPENDENT LOAD SUPPORTING SYSTEM. MUST BE RATED FOR OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT IN HOUSTON, TX. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions no. 24-36 submitted by potential offerors. Questions and answers 1-23 have been posted under previous amendments.  Question 24.  Regarding the request for bid, I cannot find the size of the walk-in required. Could you please let me know? Answer 24. See item 2a, 2b, and 2c.  A brief summary is as follows:   ·	External dimensions: 20’length (L) maximum, 10’width (W) maximum, and 9’height (H) maximum. ·	Internal dimensions: 17’L minimum X 8’W minimum X 7’H minimum. ·	Interior storage capacity: Unobstructed space of 952 cubic feet, minimum Question 25.  We can furnish the box and the refrigeration complete with delivery and installation.  If this is possible, how do I get a complete copy of the specifications and modifications? Answer 25. Yes.  The specifications are located at: LINK:   http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=   Solicitation BH13-78-02-47P Response Due:  March 22, 2002 Title HAZARDOUS MATERIALS WALK-IN FREEZER DESIGNED WITH A BASE THAT IS AN INDEPENDENT LOAD SUPPORTING SYSTEM. MUST BE RATED FOR OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT IN HOUSTON, TX. Question 26.  We are attempting to bid your Houston project but have not been able to locate the 'drawings' referred to in the Specification.  Could you please assist us so that we might have the opportunity to present a bid? Answer Yes.  The specification posted on March 7, 2002, has been updated to include the referenced drawing.  The specifications are located at: LINK:   http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin   Question 27.  We have looked all over the referenced Specifications and in each of the attached files, but cannot find any drawings as referred to in the Specifications (i.e - figure 1, figure 2, etc...)  Can you advise? Answer 27.  Figure 1 & Figure 2 are referring to the same figure.   Somehow these diagrams were lost during the posting process.  The specification posted on March 7, 2002, has been updated to include the referenced specification.   Question 28.  The factory ran a heat load test for this freezer and calculated a 15 HP compressor is required for this application. To ship a pre-assembled package, the condensing cannot be roof mounted. They propose to position it along 1 nominal 10' wall this would require locating 1 door on the nom 20' wall. Will this be acceptable to you? Answer 28. The door may be located on the length side (see Figure), however it is preferred to be located on the opposite width-end of freezer.  See item 4a.   If an additional “footprint” is needed, then the manufacturer may separate conditioning system, temperature recorders, etc… into different units from the basic structure that is limited to fitting within these external dimensions.  See item 2a.   Question 29.  The factory suggests that NASA should have specked 2 refrigeration systems to provide redundancy and back up. Should this be quoted as an alternate? Answer 29. Yes.  Items 1 to 24 in the specifications sheet are the basic requirements that must be fulfilled.  Please itemize the quote to illustrate the price of meeting the basic requirements and a separate list of the cost of each optional item.   Question 30.  The 15 HP condensing unit requires 100 amps @ 230/3 phase.  The power to be provided is 30 amps. Can this be increased? Answer 30. No these four circuits are the only circuit available in the designated location.  See item 23.a.   Question 31.  If the factory provides one-point power connections, do they need to have an electrician on site?  Will Grounding connection be provided? Answer 31. No, NASA will make site utility connection, including connecting up the specified grounding lug.  Keep in mind the bid submittal requirements (items 24.a, 24.b., 24.c., and 24.d.).  These will assist our technicians in setting up the freezer.   Question 32.  Is there a prevailing wage scale available and do workers need to be union? What type of safety courses do they need to attend? Answer 32. We will set the freezer up.   Question 33.  (Item 13) Spec is asking for "explosion proof", yet calling out electric defrost.  Is this correct?  I suppose this could be accomplished (at great cost) but what is wrong with hot gas defrost which does not involve any electrical connections? Answer 33. Explosion proof is an option.  See item 27.  Keep in mind to itemize the quote to illustrate the price of meeting the basic requirements and a separate list of the cost of each optional item (including changes in the basic requirements, See item 24.d.) Question 34.  (Item 12) Spec is calling out a "product" load of 5,000 #/day with a specific heat of 1.  If, in fact this is actually a liquid and it needs to be frozen (to -20ºC), the refrigeration required would be about 20 tons (rather than the spec estimate of 5 tons), If the "product" is something else (and does not "freeze" then the 5 tons is close.  Anyway, it would be nice to know what the product is. Answer 34. Large batteries.  Lithium Ion and Lithium Manganese Dioxide.  In the future, different battery chemistries will be stored.   Question 35.  Item 17 - Please clarify the specific requirements to be submitted. (ex: max ref. pressure, max cooling water pressure, etc.) Answer 35. Maximum design pressure and maximum/minimum design temperature for each fluid leg of each pressure system.  The intent of this is to provide information so that the NASA Pressure Systems Engineer can determine if the system meets NASA JSC Pressure Systems requirements.  See related item 24.c. Question 36.  Item 26 (Option 2) is not clear.  If only 1 pound of CO2 is vented (in 6 seconds) this results in about a 250± scfm "surge". Is this requirement simply an increase flow rate for the dry air purge of Option 1? Answer 36. This is in addition to the normal pressure equalization capacity.  Keep in mind to itemize the quote to illustrate the price of meeting the basic requirements and a separate list of the cost of each optional item (See item 24.d.) The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on February 27, 2002. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>Solicitation SP0900-02-R-X203  This notification is to provide potential sources a list of candidate items that may be offered under the subject solicitation. This list is not intended to limit in any way the content of proposals offered under this solicitation. The intent is to provide some assistance in solving the most common dilemma faced by potential sources, which is to identify commercial parts managed by DSCC-S9E that have a national stock number assigned. The list provided is only intended to assist in identifying potential candidate items. Spreadsheets consisting of FSC 5935 and FSC 5930 items managed by DSCC-S9E have been compiled. The spreadsheets provide the NSN, approved CAGE and part number, historical demand quantities, past source, and most recent price paid. The spreadsheet is available on the Internet at the URL identified below.  Hard copies of this spreadsheet are not available. This notice does not change any of the provisions of the solicitation. The government intends to provide additional candidates by Federal Supply Class (FSC) on an on going basis.---------------------         

A synopsis of this project is provided to reacquaint sources to this effort: The government intends to evaluate proposals immediately upon receipt; in the order they are received, in lieu of waiting until after the closing date. The contracts awarded under this solicitation, if any, are expected to be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery Type contracts. The contract period will be for 18 months with Firm-Fixed-Pricing for the entire contract period. This procurement is unrestricted, full and open competition, all responsible offers will be considered. Inspection and acceptance will be at destination. Shipping/transportation will be priced as FOB destination. In order to allow more specific pricing for shipping/transportation, two zones have been identified to allow separate pricing. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. 
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES: DLA?s vision is to be the Best Value provider for their customers, the Armed Forces of the United States. Their goal is ?Right Item, Right Time, Right Place, Right Price?. To achieve this, DLA plans to radically reengineer their logistics process by shifting to commercial practices. The government can no longer afford to invest large sums of money on inventory, but must instead leverage existing private sector capabilities, while at the same time satisfy the Warfighter?s requirements. The Defense supply Center Columbus (DSCC) ? Commodities (Electronics), currently manages 1.2 million items in theses Federal Supply Classes (FSC?s): 1210, 1220, 1240, 1250, 1260, 1265, 1285, 1287, 1290, 1420, 1430, 1440, 5810, 5811, 5820, 5825, 5840, 5845, 5850, 5855, 5860, 5865, 5895, 5905, 5910, 5915, 5920, 5925, 5930, 5935, 5945, 5950,5955, 5960, 5961, 5962, 5963, 5965, 5980, 5985, 5990, 5996, 5998, 5999, 6004, 6005, 6006, 6007, 6008, 6010, 6015, 6020, 6021, 6025, 6026, 6029, 6030, 6031, 6032, 6033, 6034, 6035, 6040, 6050, 6060, 6070, 6080, 6099, 6145,6625. Commodities processes over 2 million requisitions and over 60,000 awards annually in support of more than 1200 weapon systems. Approximately 45 percent of the awards are processed by an automated system, while the remaining awards are done manually. Over half of the manual awards are under $2,500, and have an average administrative lead-time over 70 days. A large percentage of the items procured by Commodities are expected to be commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items.  
In an effort to reduce logistics response time, reduce inventory levels, and increase readiness, of COTS items, DSCC intends to establish Distributor Partnerships with suppliers capable of providing COTS items within 3 days for high priority items and within 10 days for allother items. Therefore, offerors are invited to submit a list of up to 1000 electronic COTS items which can be delivered within the time frame stated above. In order to facilitate the administrative effort necessary to process multiple proposals, each vendor will be restricted to submitting a maximum of 1000 items per proposal. Multiple proposals may be submitted for evaluation, however; only one proposal will be accepted during a 180-day period. This will allow all vendors to submit proposals and be considered for award on a first come first served basis. The government intends to evaluate proposals upon receipt, in the order they are received. If a proposal is not accepted for award, the contracting officer will notify the offeror in writing. At that time a new proposal may be submitted without regard to the 180-day limitation. Each acceptable proposal will be reviewed, in the order they are received, for evaluation. It is conceivable there will be more than one basic award allowing for the possibility of awarding duplicate NSNs.  Each proposed item must have a corresponding, current and active, National Stock Number (NSN) currently managed by the Commodities Directorate. (Offerors who wish to propose items managed by DLA but which are not managed by the Commodities Directorate should contact the POC. Consideration will be given to expanding the scope to include other DLA inventory control points.) Offerors will not be evaluated against each other. The government will determine whether or not to make an award based upon each individual proposal evaluation. All responsible offerors will be eligible to receive an award of their proposed items that meet the technical, delivery, and price requirements as stated in the solicitation. Proposals will be evaluated as stated in the solicitation. In the event more than one acceptable proposal is received for the same item(s), the offeror, whose proposal was received the earliest by DSCC, will receive the delivery orders under $2,500 for that item(s). If an individual order for the duplicate NSN(s) totals over $2,500, the government will evaluate the offerors against all other valid contracts and award the order to the offeror representing the best value to the Government as defined by the Method of Evaluation in this solicitation unless at the time of order an exception as defined in FAR 16.505(b)(2) exists or if one of the duplicate offerors is a small business concern. If one of the offerors is a small business concern and the order is between $2,500 and $25,000, the award will go to the small business concern without further best value evaluation. All orders over $25,000 will utilize the best value determination. (Proposals received by facsimile will not be accepted.) If, during the contract period, that awardee fails to perform in accordance with the contract requirements for that particular item(s), the government may stop issuing delivery orders for that item(s) to the initial awardee, and begin issuing delivery orders for that item(s) to the offeror whose proposal for that item was received the next earliest. Each contract will have a minimum guarantee of 10% of the estimated contract dollar value at time of award or a minimum guarantee to be (no less than $1,000) negotiated at time of award. Without knowing which items will be proposed, the government, at this time, cannot estimate the dollar amounts of the contact(s). Likewise, the estimated quantity the government will order during the contract period is unknown.  However, vendors are encouraged to request a preliminary scrub of their items in order to obtain estimated requirements prior to submission of their proposal by contacting John Rouse at 614-692-2043. Contractual estimates and maximums will be established and agreed to prior to award. All delivery orders will be for direct delivery shipments to the using activity. Delivery orders will be issued by DSCC using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). Successful offerors must have EDI capabilities. At some point, the government may choose to place orders through the use of a credit card purchases directly by the customers.

The following engineering services are listed in the order of the amount of work anticipated for this contract.  The work includes performance of Environmental Baseline Surveys (EBS) to determine if the site(s) is/are suitable for the real property action (e.g. license lease, easement or transfer).  An EBS is a fence-to-fence, comprehensive, environmental survey of the site.  Its purpose is to collect data, document the existing environmental condition of the base, and identify areas of environmental concern (areas contaminated by past and current operations and practices).  Sampling and analysis may be required depending on the project requirements and its scope.  The EBS should include, but should not be limited to, the following topics:  (1) Above and below ground storage tanks, (2) Asbestos, (3) Hazardous materials/waste management sites, (4) Sites potentially contaminated from past operations/practices, (5) Lead-based paint, (6) Medical/biohazardous waste, (7) Ordnance, (8) Pesticide management, (9) Polychlorinated biphenyls, (10) Radon, (11) Radioactive/mixed wastes, (12) Waste water, (13) Potable water, (14) Air pollution.  Work may include follow up documentation such as Finding of Suitability to Lease (FOSL), Finding of Suitability to an Easement (FOSE), or Finding of Suitability to Transfer (FOST) which summarizes the EBS and recommends lease or deed restrictions for the real property action as required.  Other engineering services also include solid waste engineering services to prepare solid waste management plans, permit applications, annual reports, and management, operation and closure plans for various solid waste management facilities.  The

Many military areas of work anticipated under this contract will not allow the entry of aliens.  The field crew of the A-E shall be composed of U. S. citizens who can qualify for access to these areas.  If asbestos or hazardous materials exist, the A-E contractor shall identify them and provide for their disposal in the required documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous materials.  The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days of the meeting.  The contract will be an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery type where the work will be required on an as-needed basis during the life of the contract providing the Government and contractor agree on the amount.  Each project contract will be a firm-fixed price A-E Task Order.  The Government will determine the task order amount by using rates negotiated and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.  The contract shall not exceed twelve months or a maximum of $1,000,000 total fee, whichever, comes first.  The Government guarantees a minimum amount of $10,000 for the contract.  Should an impasse on the price occur over the initial or subsequent projects, the Government will apply the dollar value of the Government estimate for that project or projects toward the minimum guarantee.  The Government reserves the option to extend the contract for an additional four years for a total of five years, with a maximum fee of $1,000,000 per year.  There will be no future synopsis in the event the options included into the contract are exercised.  Estimated date of contract award is July 2002.

<SUBJECT>A -- Autonomous Pathogendetection System (APDS)
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE AUTONOMOUS PATHOGENDETECTION SYSTEM (APDS). 

Announcement: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's Autonomous Pathogen Detection System (APDS).

Scientists at LLNL have invented a stand-alone system for rapid, continuous monitoring of multiple airborne biological threat agents in the environment. This system, the autonomous pathogen detection system (APDS), acts as a "biosmoke alarm" and is targeted for domestic applications in which the public is at high risk to exposure to covert releases of bioagent (such as mass transit, office complexes, and convention centers), and as part of a monitoring network for urban areas and major gatherings (inaugurations, Olympics, etc.). The APDS is completely automated, offering aerosol sampling, in-line sample preparation fluidics, multiplex flow cytometer detection and identification assays, and orthogonal, flow-through PCR (nucleic acid) amplification and detection. This system has several key advantages over competing technologies: (1) the ability to measure up to 100 different agents and controls in a single sample, (2) the flexibility and ease with which new bead-based assays can be developed and integrated into the system, (3) extremely low false positive and false negative detection due to the presence of two orthogonal detection methods, (4) the ability to use the same basic system components for multiple deployment architectures, and (5) the relatively low cost per assay and minimal consumables. LLNL is in the process of patenting this invention.  In the meantime, LLNL is seeking industrial partners to commercialize the invention. LLNL is also looking for collaborative research and development to improve the invention and to explore other usages of the invention. 

Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Autonomous Pathogen Detection System (APDS) should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology. Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is printed to ensure consideration of your response. Written responses should be directed to:
