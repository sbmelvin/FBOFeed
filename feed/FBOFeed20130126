All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing via email to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Vicki Supler, at Vicki.supler@la.usda.gov. A formal site showing will be conducted for this requirement. For advance planning purposes, the date and time of the site showing is as follows:</p>
<p>DATE:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;February 13, 2013<br />TIME:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10:00 a.m.<br />LOCATION: Bob's Bayou Black Marina<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 251 Marina Drive<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gibson, LA 70356</p>
<p>All Offerors are required to bring their own boat transportation for site viewing purposes and are responsible for the payment of any marina fees. All parties shall contact the Contracting Officer with confirmation of their attendance at least two (2) days prior to the site showing date.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK: The TE-43 GIWW project consists of the construction of a composite rock dike structure along the banks of the GIWW. Works consists of clearing and grubbing, pollution control, construction surveys, driving sheet piling, excavation, rockfill-lightweight aggregate (estimated 15,000 cy), rock riprap (estimated 50,300 tons), metal fabrication &amp; installation, placement of geotextile (estimated 40,650 sy), identification markers and plaques and quality control and other incidental work as specified in the specifications and as indicated on the drawing.</p>
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: All Offerors will be required to submit a separate Technical and Cost Proposal for consideration for this requirement which demonstrates their qualifications and technical capability to successfully execute the firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the proposals in accordance with the selection criteria that is described in Section M of the solicitation and intends to award one firm fixed price contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the best value to the Government by using the trade-off process described in FAR Part 15. This process permits tradeoffs between price and technical capability/quality and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced offer or other than the highest technically rated offer. The award decision will be based on a comparative assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation. <br />The following evaluation (rating) criteria listed below shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals:</p>
<p>VOLUME 1: Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Factor 1. Past Performance<br />Factor 2. Technical Approach<br />Factor 3. Key Personnel and Project Management Plan</p>
<p>VOLUME 2: Cost Proposal</p>
<p>Factor 4. Price</p>
<p>Factors 1 and 3 are approximately equal in importance and are significantly less important when compared to Factor 2. Factor 4 is significantly less important than Factors 1, 2 and 3. <br /><br />Factor 4, which is Price, may become more significant in contributing to the source selection decision if competing proposals offer comparatively equal Past Performance and Technical Approaches and due consideration is given to Key Personnel and Management Plan.<br /><br />The Government is concerned with striking the most advantageous balance between Technical Capability (i.e. quality and timeliness) and cost to the Government (price). Where competing technical proposals are determined to be substantially equal, price will become the controlling factor.</p>

Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
