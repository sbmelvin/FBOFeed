Recent (within the past 5 years), relevant performance in preparing projects valued between $100,000 and $1,000,000 may result in a higher rating and should be addressed accordingly. Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less qualified. The primary factor for selection shall be the most qualified firm.

The effectiveness of the proposed project team (management structure and coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors) is also considered. <br />(3) Capacity: The firm's available capacity of key disciplines and experience with similar size projects is evaluated. This evaluation may be based upon the amount of other work currently being performed by the A-E and the overall size of the firm.<br />(4) Past Performance: Past performance on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. References and letters of commendation are also evaluated.

<p>Solicitation Number: FA875010D0042</p>
<p>This is a Presolicitation Synopsis. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This serves as a "Notice of Intent" of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate's intent to issue a modification to increase the maximum ordering amount of the basic contract FA8750-10-D-0042, titled "Tactical Targeting Network Technology Development (TTNTD)" on a sole source basis. The current contract maximum ordering amount is $49.9M and the contemplated maximum ordering amount increase is $35.5M for a new maximum ordering amount of $85.4M. This contract is being performed by Rockwell Collins Incorporated, Government Systems, CAGE Code: 13499. The Air Force plans to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), to increase the maximum ordering amount of the TTNTD contract.</p>
<p>Worldwide urgent needs and contingency operations have created contractual demands that exceed the current TTNTD maximum ordering amount. The services provided by Rockwell Collins Incorporated that must continue without interruption include TTNT Terminal builds, upgrades, refurbishment, maintenance, and training to support urgent contingency operations, software configuration management of TTNT waveform software, continued development and qualification testing of TTNT Waveform version 7 software, TTNT Terminal interoperability testing with Quint Networking Technology (QNT) terminals, troubleshooting software and hardware problems, and on-going exercise and demonstration support. Without the capability to obtain these highly specialized services, contingency operations will be jeopardized and TTNT and QNT users will quickly experience mission performance degradation, and possible mission stoppage. The Air Force believes that Rockwell Collins is the only responsible source for continued development of highly specialized TTNT equipment and software for the immediate need of the warfighter, and that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs (which could not be recovered through competition). Technical questions should be directed to the Laboratory Program Manager, Michael Hartnett at (315) 330-4514, email: Michael.Hartnett@rl.af.mil, or Michael Gudaitis at (315) 330-4478, email: Michael.Gudaitis@rl.af.mil.</p>
<p>Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days after the publication date of this notice of contract action. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541712. Responses and inquiries can be mailed to the Contract Specialist, Karl VanDenTop, AFRL/RIKD, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441 or e-mailed to Karl.VanDenTop@rl.af.mil. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE WILL BE ADVERTISED AS A NONCOMPETITIVE SOLE SOURCE SOLICITATION.   As provided under FAR 6.302-1, this requirement will be solicited on a noncompetitive basis as "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements".
Requirement: The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder Canyon Operation Office (BCOO), Boulder City, Nevada (Reclamation) has a requirement for annual user maintenance and support as well as annual upgrades and enhancements for RiverWare.  (Product Service Code: D302 - Advanced Data Processing (ADP) Systems Development and NAICS Code 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services).   It is Reclamation's intent to award a five (5) year, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Type contract, on a sole source basis to the University of Colorado's, Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems (CADSWES), 3100 Marine Street, Room 481, Boulder City, CO 80309-0572 to support this requirement.  This contract will have a guaranteed minimum award dollar value of $180,000 and a maximum award dollar value that shall not exceed $1,000,000 over the five year performance period.  
Since 1993, Reclamation, the Tennessee Valley Authority and CADSWES have participated in a collaborative research and development program to develop decision support tools for water management.  Riverware is a major application that was developed from this program.  RiverWare plays an integral role in the daily scheduling and monitoring of water deliveries along the Lower Colorado River System.  The scheduling and monitoring of this volume of water via a system of dams, powerplants and diversion canals requires that RiverWare be operational at all times.  To remain operational, annual user support, software upgrades and enhancements are required.  Professional software standards are applied to maintain a reliable, robust, version-controlled software product that is exclusively licensed through the University of Colorado Technology Transfer Office.  RiverWare is proprietary software that is exclusively maintained, supported developed and enhanced by CADSWES.  The support, development and enhancements required by Reclamation are identified annually and require changes to the RiverWare source code to implement.  These changes can only be accomplished by CADSWES.  As there are no known commercially available applications that can meet the specific needs of Reclamation, the Government intends to solicit this requirement on a noncompetitive basis.   
This procurement will be awarded using Commercial - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Award is anticipated to be made in mid June 2011 and run for a five year period ending in June 2016.   The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price type.  
The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source for this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.   
The contract award information will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (FBO) at (www.fedbizopps.gov).  The Justification and Approval for using noncompetitive procedures will be posted after an award is made at the following address: http://www.usbr.gov/mso/aamd/doing-business-acquisitions-noncompetitive.html 
The point of contact for this acquisition is Liz Bailey eebailey@usbr.gov  or call 702-293-8460.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science, intends to award a sole source contract to TECAN U.S., P.O. Box 13953, Research Triangle, N.C. 27709 for the Acquisition of the EVO 200 Pipetting Workstation. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 423450, Medical, Dental and Hospital Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers.
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to aquire instrumentation EVO200 Pipetting Workstation Dual LiHa, MCA96 system including software, printer which is needed to maintain continuity of our methods, research projects and ongoing studies related to the aliquoting of human blood samples. These samples are evaluated for the required measurement of Acrylamide and Glycidamide adducts in blood for the CDC NHANES biomonitoring project mandated to assess dietary exposure to acrylamide to address this critical public health need. TECAN U.S. will also provide services such as installation, (5) day training workshop and a service waranty for one year. Additionally, services include the removal of the older Tecan Genesis Freedom 200 multipipetting liquid handling workstation.</p>
<p>TECAN U.S. liquid handlers uses patented dual LiHa MCA96 Configuration technologies for exact liquid transfer that is not available by any other manufacturer. This type of liquid transfer assures the highest degree of accuracy, percision, and safety with regards to sensitive scientific work processes, contributing to the excellence and total quality for CDC continuity in ongoing NHANES research and high throughout. Furthermore, using instruments from the same manufacturer would greatly reduce the time necessary to modify a method on a different type of instrument. This would include additional training, method development, and method characterization which could take 1-4 months in revalidating the methods, reprogramming software and continuity in instrument sensitivity by each instrument when compared to others. TECAN U.S. is the manufacturer and also distribute this patented pipetting dual arm workstation and is the only known source that completely satisfies the government reqiurements. TECAN U.S. technicians and engineers will perform the installation, service and continuous monitoring and provisions of services as requested for the patented instumentation. TECAN U.S. is the only source capable of providing trained and qualified technical and scientific staff with prior knowledge and experience with the ability to promptly respond to any logged complaints.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the TECAN. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfi3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2011-91983 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN March 10, 2011.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>Notice Type: <br />Pre-solicitation
<p>Synopsis: <br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue, on a sole source basis, a solicitation to procure the "State Estimate of Workers' Compensation Costs" to the&nbsp;National Academy of Social Insurance. The "State Estimate of Workers' Compensation Costs" will provide CMS the workers' compensation premiums earned in 2009 (base year), as well as medical and cash benefits paid and incurred for injuries occurring in 2009 for each state.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation notice is hereby posted in accordance with FAR 5.2. CMS reserves the right and anticipates making a single contract award.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued in accordance with FAR Part 15. CMS plans to issue the solicitation on a sole source basis.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: <br />The National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) are estimates of health spending for the United States produced by the National Health Statistics Group (NHSG) in the Office of the Actuary. The NHEA is a matrix designed health spending account that summarizes health spending by major health service categories as well as the major sources of funding for each service category. Included in the source of funds for the NHEA are estimates for health spending under workers' compensation programs. For purposes of more fully developing workers' compensation data for the NHEA and evaluating the inclusion of workers' compensation data for the SHEA, the NHSG would like to purchase a state-level database of workers' compensation premiums and benefit expenditures. <br />The anticipated award date of the contract is expected to be by June 1, 2011<br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The Government will not evaluate responses or accept phone calls in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>This project will be for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Construction. A unique feature of Dept of Veterans Affairs Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract(s) for Construction is the use of a published Unit Price Book (UPB) to establish the direct material, labor, and equipment price for the specific work to be performed for each individual construction project. After reaching a negotiated agreement as to which UPB line items and quantities meet the task order requirements, the indirect costs, overhead, and profit are then included by multiplying the UPB raw costs by the appropriate coefficient factor established for the contract. This will result in a definitive firm fixed price for the specific project task order. 

The contract will consist of a one year Base ordering period with a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000.00 for all task orders and will also have two Option ordering periods of one year each, with a dollar limit of $3,000,000.00 for each Option period. If all options are exercised, the maximum potential dollar amount of contract will be $9,000,000.00. The total contract completion time shall not exceed three years.

The minimum amount for any individual task orders issued for each contract will be $20,000 (unless the selected firm is an Emerging Small Business) and the maximum amount for any individual task order will not exceed $500,000.00.

Minimum Obligation. In accordance with FAR 16.504(a) the Contracting Officer has determined that the minimum obligation for the IDIQ contract awarded under this solicitation will be ($20,000.00). This minimum obligation falls within the size limits for individual orders. Therefore, the minimum obligation will be met by the issuance of one or more task orders. This minimum obligation amount applies to the entire contract, even if the options for up to two additional one-year ordering periods are exercised.

This Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Construction will be located at:  
1.	Ralph H. Johnson VAMC, 109 Bee Street, Charleston, SC 29401-5799
2.	Community Based Outpatient Centers and Vet Centers located in:
a.	North Charleston, SC
b.	Savannah, GA
c.	Myrtle Beach, SC
3.	Beaufort National Cemetery

The general scope of work is for construction, maintenance, repair, and alteration of existing real property facilities and assets, including site and utility work, located at the VA Medical Center and supported facilities. Work will be issued by individually negotiated task orders. The contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, tools, equipment, transportation, and qualified supervision necessary to accomplish these Task Orders. All construction services shall be provided in accordance with the technical plans and specifications provided for each project task order, and shall comply with applicable building codes and environmental/safety regulations.  

	(2) The type of construction services includes, but is not limited to: 

		- Demolition (including Lead/Asbestos removal and Disposal); 
		- Concrete; 
		- Masonry; 
		- Metalwork; 
		- Carpentry; 
		- Thermal and Moisture Protection; 
		- Doors and Windows; 
		- Interior & Exterior Finishes; 
		- Specialties (including Equipment & Furnishings); 
		- Fire Suppression; 
		- Plumbing; 
		- HVAC (including Testing and Balancing); 
		- Electrical (including Communications & Security); and 
		- Exterior Site Improvements.

In order to provide timely response to new task order requirements, the contractor shall be able to respond to requests for on-site meetings within no less than two and one-half (2-1/2) hours. This requirement can be met by operating out of the contractors home office, if it is located close enough to the given VA Medical Facility.  

As an alternative, the contractor may choose to operate out of an established satellite office, provided it is close enough to meet the response time and is staffed by the contractors principal representative authorized to engage in binding negotiations. However the requirement is met, for the entire duration of the contract, the contractor must comply with the 2-1/2 hour response time during normal business hours from 8:00 am to 4:30 pm, Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. 

Consideration is limited to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses, and the solicitation will be issued as a Sealed Bid.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 236220 and the Small Business Size Standard is $33.5M.  This notice is issued subject to the availability of funds and is not a request for proposal.  The solicitation will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities Website on or about April 26, 2011.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Midstates Area Procurement Office intends to issue on a sole source basis with Pinnacle Towers LLC, 2000 Corporate Dr, Canonsburg, PA 15317.  This acquisition is for lease of antenna space located near Tyler, TX, Lubbock, TX, and Oklahoma City, OK.

Pinnacle Towers LLC has proprietary rights to this antenna site.    

The resulting purchase order will be for a one year period, with a period of performance from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:jonathan.nadig@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Tulsa</a>
<DESC>Building 416 is a 422,500 square foot facility that houses material for the Air Force.  The roof replacement is 10 acres.  Government, Contracted Hires, and Union Employees work in this facility on a 24 hour schedule.  This project received funding based on a Risk Assessment Code (RAC) 1 safety rating.  Risk Assessment Codes range from 1 to 3 with RAC 1 as the highest potential for risk, RAC 2 is significant risk, and RAC 3 is marginal risk.  The current roof system is a RAC 1 which prohibits access onto the roof of the facility since the risk of roof failure and falling through is imminent.  Repairs to the roof or the mechanical equipment on the roof are prohibited.  Safety netting has been installed in certain areas inside the warehouse to protect the workers from falling material.  Workers must wear hard hats in the facility at all times. <br><br>Unique Project Elements: <br>a. Restrictions/Phasing: In addition, to the current safety issues associated with this project, the construction phase will require a Contractor experienced with scheduling and phasing work to maintain a productive schedule. There will be at least 3 active construction projects ongoing within the facility during this roof replacement: Racking Project, Ventilation Upgrade, and Fire Sprinkler Upgrades. Each of these projects will require coordination and care so as not to damage newly installed items or impact access to perform work. <br><br>b. Occupied Facility: The facility will remain occupied and functional during this project. Union and non-union workers are present in this facility.  Any impact to the functionally or access to the facility requires high level and early coordination for Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to alert/negotiate with labor unions. <br><br>c. RAC Rating: The contractor will need to have a health & safety program to properly schedule/phase this work to protect their worker and building occupants. <br><br>The Roof demolition/repair of Building 416 located on Tinker Air Force Base (AFB) is scheduled for an unrestricted solicitation as a 100% Designed construction project in the middle of April 2011.   This project is scheduled for award in late June or early July 2011.<br><br>The entire roofing system will be removed with additional structure added to raise the roof systems to accommodate a revised/updated Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system for better conditioning of the facility.  The new roof will consist of new metal decking with a built up 3-ply roof system with cap sheet.  The Building Ventilation System will also be upgraded to eliminate dead spots and areas of poor air circulation within the building.  This will require new and additional mechanical equipment both on the roof as well as modifications to the walls of the warehouse to allow additional ventilation.  In addition, a minimum energy savings of approximately 30% over the existing system shall be obtained.<br><br>The magnitude of this project's price is estimated between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. <br><br>The point of contact for this announcement is Jonathan Nadig, jonathan.nadig@usace.army.mil, 918-669-7041.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.<br><br><br>This Is A Request For Information Announcement For Purposes Of Conducting Market Research Only.  There Is No Solicitation Available At This Time.  Requests For A Solicitation Will Not Receive A Response.  <br><br>The U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is conducting market research to identify flame resistant fabric materials that meet or exceed criteria defined in NFPA 1977-2005, Standard on Protective Clothing and Equipment for Wildland Fire Fighting and are suitable for use in a wild land fire fighter uniform.  The National Protection Center (NPC), NSRDEC, is conducting this effort on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate.  The objective of this program is to develop a new wild land fire fighter uniform that will improve the current level of flame and heat protection while decreasing the heat stress of the wearer during fire fighting operations.  This information will be used to select a uniform material for this application.<br><br>All materials must meet the requirements of NFPA 1977-2005 and the following levels of protection and comfort, as determined by the following test methods:<br><br>1.	Physical Characteristics<br>a.	Tearing Strength, per ASTM D 1424 - 5 lb. min. <br>b.	Dimensional Stability, AATCC 135 - 5.0 max<br><br>2.	Comfort - <br>a.	Total Heat Loss (THL), per ASTM F 1868 - THL shall be 500 or greater.<br>b.	Air permeability, per ASTM D 737 - No specific performance level is required.<br><br>3.	Protection - <br>a.	Radiant Protective Performance (RPP), per ASTM 1939 - RPP shall be 10 or greater.<br>b.	Thermal Shrinkage, per NFPA 1977-2005 - 10% max<br>c.	Flame Resistance (FR), per ASTM F 6413. <br>i.	After flame - 2 seconds max<br>ii.	Char length - 4 inches max<br>iii.	Melt/drip - none<br><br>Technical testing data for the above criteria must be included in your response.  Data should include the test results, who performed the testing, and when it was performed.  Complete testing reports are not required.  <br><br>This information will be evaluated by the program office.  Based on the technical data provided by each respondent, the program office will determine if materials require additional test and evaluation.  The results of this program will be used by California Wild Land Fire Fighters to make decisions regarding the selection of materials for next generation duty uniforms.   <br><br>Because this material is not intended for a Department of Defense or a Department of Homeland Security application nor is the procurement of a wild land fire fighter duty uniform subject to FEMA grant funding, this survey is open to all sources of textile material, both foreign and domestic, to include small businesses.  The sourcing of material will need to be identified since individual state and local agencies may or may not have procurement rules or regulations pertaining to sourcing of materials or garments. <br><br>Respondents to this request for information shall submit: <br>1.	A physical description of the material, including weight per square yard.<br>2.	Test data, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above, to characterize the comfort and performance of the material. <br>3.	Indicate whether additional material is available for purchase and the lead time required for purchase.  <br>4.	Identify the sourcing (foreign or domestic) of the material.<br>5.	Identify the cost of the material ($ USD/square yard).<br>6.	Any information of prior use of this material in another uniform application.<br>7.	Any attachments shall be in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format.<br><br>The Government will not reimburse any business concern for any information submitted in response to this sources sought request.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  This is a sources sought notice for market research purposes only.  The US Army Contracting Command - Rock Island is planning an acquisition for the requirements of the Program Management Support Services-Three (PMSS-3) staff augmentation program. PMSS-3 is a follow-on to the current PMSS-2 Contract which expires 20 June 2014. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify qualified sources that can meet the Army's support services requirements. The PMSS-3 program is managed by the Program Executive Office, Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), Operations  Directorate (OD), Contracts Compliance and Management Division (CACD), Ft Belvoir, VA 22060. The purpose of PMSS-3 is to provide the full range of information technology-related program management support services, to include advisory and acquisition consulting services, required by PEO EIS headquarters, directorates, program/project/product offices, and PEO EIS related organizations in support of various missions and of command, control, and communications activities.  The PMSS-3 acquisition will provide the requiring offices with the means to acquire and select from new sources of assets and capabilities to support their program management support services requirements.  For more information about the PEO EIS organization, see the following website: www.eis.army.mil <br> <br>Statement of Need.  Successful PMSS-3 contractors shall ensure that a broad range of expertise is available in many disciplines and specifically in the functional areas of Program/Project/Product Management; Business Process Reengineering (BPR); Information Systems Security; Contingency Planning; Physical Security; Enterprise Design, Integration, and Consolidation; Systems Operation and Maintenance; Integrated Logistics Support; Acquisition Management Support and other Information Technology-related Services for the life cycle activities that are required by the organizations.  <br><br>Capability Statement. An interested source may provide a corporate capability statement. The statement shall explain why the source believes that it has the technical capability to meet the Government's requirements to include experience of personnel, organizational history on meeting this or similar requirements, corporate acumen in managing multiple government contracts of the same or similar nature, ability to expand its workforce to perform multiple, concurrent, high-value task orders, e.g. through teaming, hiring, internal reassignment, etc.  The statement should also include an example in which it has succeeded in rapidly expanding its personnel capacity.  The statement shall include the source's website address; most relevant Government or corporate client (one client reference only) and POC for this client; business size and applicable NAICS codes; socio-economic status; number of employees; and annual revenue for the last three Government fiscal years. This statement shall not exceed 7 pages. The page limit does not apply to advertising material such as company brochures and catalogs. <br><br>Acquisition Strategy.  The Government intends to award five, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.  Three of the contracts will be awarded on the basis of full and open competition, and two awards will be reserved for small business.  However, the Government reserves the right to award less than five contracts.  Issuance of Task Orders will be limited to PEO EIS components.  The geographic scope of the contract will include CONUS and OCONUS, and onsite work may be required in hazardous locations, such as Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan. The contracts and task orders will be performance-based. Task orders will be competed on a fair opportunity basis among all PMSS-3 contractors. The contract life will be 3 years.  The applicable NAICS code is 541611. The applicable PSC is R408. <br><br>Pricing Strategy. The Government intends to utilize multiple contract types for PMSS-3 contracts e.g. Firm-Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Fixed Price Level of Effort, Time & Material and Labor Hour Task Orders. <br><br>Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs). Interested sources are advised that the provisions of FAR Subpart 9.5 concerning OCIs will govern Task Orders issued under the PMSS-3 contract and that potential OCIs with current and future procurements and programs may exist, in accordance with FAR 9.505-1 through 9.505-4, because of the tasks in the PWS, such as requirements management, specification development, program oversight, independent testing, etc. Consequently, the PMSS-3 contractors will be excluded from participating in these procurements and programs. It is anticipated that at a minimum all current ITES2S prime contractors may be excluded from participating in the PMSS-3 competition. <br><br>Due Diligence. A draft solicitation, pre-solicitation conference, and pre-proposal conference are not planned.  A best value evaluation will be performed IAW FAR Part 15. The Government will select the proposals that are determined to be the most advantageous to the Government. The evaluation factors under consideration include, but not limited to, corporate capabilities, price, past performance, technical/management and small business participation. <br><br>Schedule. The Government plans on releasing the PMSS-3 solicitation in the third quarter of CY 2011.  At the appropriate time an additional solicitation synopsis will be issued and the solicitation will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site.  <br><br>Response Format.  Responses shall be single-spaced, 12-point font, and not less than 1 inch margins.

<DESC>The Contracting Activity is the General Services Administration, Heartland Supply Operations Center (HSOC), Kansas City, Missouri.  The HSOC was officially created in July 2004, as the Heartland Global Supply.  In May 2009, the Center's name was officially changed to Heartland Supply Operations Center.  However, the general functions have been performed in some manner since GSA's inception in 1949.  In 2006, the Office of General Supplies and Services (GSS) was established within the FAS organization. GSS consolidated the legacy Federal Supply Service organizations of Commercial Acquisition and Global Supply.  The creation of GSS also changed the reporting structure for the offices within its portfolio.  As such, Heartland Supply Operations Center is considered a national organization that reports directly to Central Office with reduced influence from the Regional Commissioner and Regional Administrator.<br />
<p>GSA is a Federal agency that provides logistics support for the missions of the military and civilian Government agencies.  In support of GSA's mission, the HSOC performs the engineering/technical, purchasing, customer service, and inventory management of items within several Federal Stock Classes (FSCs) including, but not limited to, 5120 Hand Tools, 5130 Power Tools, 5210 Measuring Devices, 5180 Tool Kits, 8010 Paints and Paint Supplies, 8030 Sealants, and 8040 Adhesives.</p>
<p>The Heartland Supply Operations Center was established as a trusted and reliable supply source in the acquisition of special orders and stock replenishment.  We provide support for agencies within the federal government who wish to procure products that are found through the Facilities Management and Hardware Acquisition Center (FMHAC), formerly the Center for Facilities Maintenance and Hardware (CFMH) acquisition center with a special focus on national stock numbered (NSN) items that are consistent with the DoD Standardization Act.  Our procurement professionals implement new contracts and issue task orders against multiple award schedules that provide the federal community with expedited access to industry experts.</p>
<p>FSC 5180, Tool Kits, has historically been a strong area of interest for customers and vendors.  The market trend in the last decade has been a customer push towards vendor managed tool kits with tool kit requirements, oftentimes being specific to a customer agency or to a specific customer.  In addition, there has been a strong emphasis on item placement within the kit, fitted framing to hold each item in the kit, and a need for quality boxes/packaging as oftentimes these kits are used in a war zone or in support of contingency operations.</p>
<p>Definition: Sourcing 1) The process of identifying sources that could provide needed products or services for the acquiring organization; 2) The term used to reflect the entire purchasing process or cycle.<br />Source: http://www.ism.ws ISM Glossary of Key Supply Management Terms</p>
<p>The Government intends to establish multiple blanket purchase agreements using FAR 13.5 Test Procedures and FAR 13.303 Blanket Purchase Agreements for tool kit product lifecycle management including sourcing and acquisition of the tool kits (supplies with ancillary services).  The length of this acquisition vehicle would be for five years.  Over its life, as GSA or customers identify tool kits that are in need of detailed descriptions being written, warranty issues, sourcing, and other product lifecycle management issues GSA would have the option of using this BPA to fulfill these requirements.  This is not a mandatory use vehicle for tool kit purchasing within the Center, and is only a tool available to contracting officers to fulfill requirements as they arise.</p>
<p>The multiple blanket purchase agreements would be established based off of an initial full and open competition (or restricted depending on the results of this sources sought and market survey, to include the possibility of setting aside some awards and not others) using a relatively small number of tool kits, around 20 with varying numbers of components, requirements, and demands.  Subsequent requests for quote for the same or similar requirements will be sent only to the initial BPA holders.  The intent as of the time of this sources sought and market survey is to make between 2 and 5 awards - to between 2 and 5 suppliers.  More than one award will not be made to the same company as part of the multiple awards - representing itself, in a partnership, or other arrangement.</p>
<p>Initial award factors will likely be focused on quality, sourcing capabilities (to include rapid sourcing capabilities), ability to manage the lifecycle of the items over an extended period of time, past performance, and price.  Price is likely to be significantly less important than all of the other factors combined.  All prices provided will be expected to be fair and reasonable and a determination will be made by a contracting officer for each kit and every component in the kit using competition and other market information available to them prior to any awards being made.</p>
<p>In addition to the awards made for each tool kit, awards will also be made for every component in the kit.  As part of managing the lifecycle of the tool kits, suppliers will be required to ensure that kits are modernized and meeting the standards and requirements of GSA and the customers, to include item placement and fitted framing within the kits, and quality boxes and packaging.</p>
<p>This approach may change depending on the results of the market survey and other factors.</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this sources sought using the format provided below.  As an attachment (.rtf or .doc) to an email, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Name of Company<br />2. DUNS Number<br />3. Contact information of authorized agent(s), no more than two (name, phone, and email)<br />4. Size of business for NAICS: 332212<br />5. Other socio-economic status that is verifiable<br />6. Statement of capability for sourcing tool kits and components<br />7. Statement of capability for lifecycle management of tool kits<br />8. Comments or questions regarding an initial multiple award and subsequent requests for quote to the agreement holders<br />9. Comments regarding proposed evaluation factors<br />10.  Other comments or questions</p>
<p>The subject line of the email response must be in the following format: "(Company Name), QSDM-H9-110034 SOI".  Please send the email to Nathan Stewart (nathan.stewart@gsa.gov) by 1:00 PM Central Time on April 13th, 2011.  I will not accept statements of interest from interested parties in any other format.

<DESC>This partnering synopsis solicits potential partners to participate in developing aproposal addressing the goals and objectives of NASA Research Announcement (NRA)NNH11ZUA001N, NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC).  The NRA can be accessed at: http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/solicitations.do?method=open&stack=push Participation in this partnering synopsis is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S.organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions,the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. GovernmentAgencies.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other MinorityUniversities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned smallbusinesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses,and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply.  Participation bynon-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds,in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs.Under the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC), the NRA solicits multiple studies,each of which will investigate an architecture, mission, or system concept that has thepotential to change the possible in aeronautics or space. NASA Innovative AdvancedConcepts (NIAC) is also part of the Office of Chief Technologist (OCT). Concepts proposedfor NIAC Phase I studies must be innovative and visionary, technically substantiated, andvery early in development (10+ years out; Technology Readiness Level 1, 2, or early 3).Focused technology maturation and incremental improvement are explicitly not of interestin this program. In response to the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NNH11ZUA001N, NASA InnovativeAdvanced Concepts (NIAC) partners are sought to demonstrate concepts for planetaryexploration using autonomous robotic swarms. Exploration of remote planetary surfaces hasbeen limited to few humans and singular robotic vehicles thus severely limiting the rangeand duration of expeditions. NASA has proposed an exploratory airplane for MARS thatwould extend the range but removes the robot from surface contact and still presents asingular view. A flying swarm of a large number of smaller vehicles, operatingautonomously yet cooperatively, could extend the exploration range while maintainingdirect surface contact as the swarm hops from point to point. Such a design has theadded benefit that individual failure would not condemn the mission to fail (e.g., 80% ofindividuals could fail with 100% mission success). A swarm design presents new problemssuch as how the swarm will effectively fly in formation and how the swarm will determinecourse of action. Because much the environment is unknown, the swarm must adapt tounforeseen situations. Centralized control and predetermined script execution is likelynot practical. Without directions from a central controller, individual members of theswarm are limited to local observations and communication with neighboring members. Fromthese observations, individuals must make autonomous decisions and take individualaction. From these actions, a behavior emerges. Thus, the challenge is to design theswarm for desired emergent behavior. NASA seeks a demonstration of true autonomy information flying of a swarm and in decisions on actions of the swarm to complete anexploratory mission. A successful demonstration will not have the swarm directed by acentral controller but will exhibit swarm action emerging from combined action ofautonomous individuals.In particular NASA LaRC is seeking potential partners having demonstrated experience andexpertise in application of autonomy and cognition to robotic systems. Such experiencemust go beyond conventional automatic operation, where robots move and act independentlyby executing predetermined scripts. The experience must facilitate action by autonomousrobots to assess their environment and make cognitive decisions to adapt to unforeseencircumstances.Teaming with providers of and leveraging emerging technologies, such as current andrecent Small Business Innovative Research awards(http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.fov/SBIR/awards.htm), is of special interest.If selected through this synopsis, it is expected that the selected partner(s) will workwith NASA LaRC scientists and engineers to jointly develop the proposal.  If the proposalis selected, NASA LaRC anticipates issuing grants, cooperative agreements, intra or interagency transfers or contracts to the selected partner(s) for performance of the proposedtasks.This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts orother agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for theinformation solicited.	It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at nocost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules, andcost estimates. Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria in the followingorder of importance:(1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, key personnelavailability, and demonstration of development of autonomous and cognitive roboticsystems. This criterion evaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, pastperformance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform thedevelopment, and key personnel available to support the development.  Substantiveevidence of successful participation in similar developments should be included.(2) Cost and schedule control.	This criterion evaluates the proposers ability tocontrol both cost and schedule.  The proposer should provide evidence of successfullycontrolling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence ofmanagement processes in this area.(3) Facilities.  This criterion evaluates the proposers facilities (development,testing, and analysis) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability/access and the ability to meet theproposed objectives.RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to 8 pagesin not less than 12-point font.  Responses must address the aforementioned evaluationcriteria.  All responses shall be submitted to LaRC electronically via email by 5:00pmEST on April 11, 2011 to Kennie Jones (k.h.jones@nasa.gov) and Brad Gardner(Robert.B.Gardner@nasa.gov). Technical and Programmatic questions should be directed to Kennie Jones(k.h.jones@nasa.gov).  Procurement questions should be directed to Brad Gardner(Robert.B.Gardner@nasa.gov).

Exploration of remote planetarysurfaces has been limited to few humans and singular robotic vehicles thus severelylimiting the range and duration of expeditions. NASA has proposed an exploratory airplanefor MARS that would extend the range but removes the robot from surface contact and stillpresents a singular view. A sensor network, a distribution of a large number ofconnected, capable devices distributed over a region, could extend the range ofexploration without the requirement for mobility. Conventional sensor network design islimited to a sense and send scenario where individual devices periodically sense theenvironment and send information through a multi-hop network of others to the centralcontroller. However, a much more complex mission could be accomplished by a virtualswarm over the distribution. While the individual devices remain fixed, the applicationcould move around the network as required to complete the mission. To take full advantageof the architecture and achieve maximum success, the application must adapt to unforeseencircumstances presented by the environment. A successful demonstration will exhibitcommunication among a fixed set of devices that directs where and when observations aretaken and what actions will be taken to complete a mission. Devices must not be directedby a central controller or a predetermined script but must exhibit adaptive behavior to anon-deterministic scenario.In particular NASA LaRC is seeking potential partners having demonstrated experience andexpertise in application of autonomy and cognition to robotic systems.

<DESC>This SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT is a Market Survey for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation, to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement.  

The Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme, CA is seeking new technologies that convert waste to clean energy (WTCE).
 It is a market survey to identify potential commercially available and near commercially available WTCE technology packages for processing one or more of the existing waste streams at the military installations. The waste includes, but is not limited to, municipal solid waste, green waste, and food waste. The energy output includes, but is not limited to, electricity and synthetic gas.  WTCE technologies will be required to meet proposed state-level environmental legislative and regulatory regulations which may have an impact on Department Of Defense operations in 50 states, District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.  Interested sources should respond with brief documentation showing the companys ability to fulfill the requirements described below.
  

Interested sources will indicate whether they offer the technology for meeting local and state legislation and regulations, particularly in southern California.  Interested sources will briefly describe their technology, in particular acceptable waste streams, feedstock preprocessing equipment, WTCE equipment, pollution control equipment, and estimated efficiency out (e.g., Kwh/ton). It is desirable that the WTCE system is a modular unit which is capable of handling 10 tons per day to 100 tons per day and is scalable to handle a larger load.

The principal recipients of the new technologies are military activities of the Navy and Marine Corps. In order to assist the activity manager in evaluating the cost/benefit of the candidate WTCE technology, the following information will be desirable for each WTCE technology: required infrastructure (land area), estimated capital cost (e.g., $/ton), estimated operation and maintenance costs, and return-on-investment calculation depending upon the best financial options.

Interested sources must submit any information relating to this announcement in writing via e-mail to lynn.torres@navy.mil  and richard.lee1@navy.mil.
  The deadline for receiving responses is 30 April 2011.  Responses received after this deadline may not be considered.   Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants.

  The BFTT system provides Commanding Officers, Battle Group Commanders and the Afloat Training Group (ATG) with the ability to conduct coordinated, realistic, high stress, combat system team training while inport and at-sea.  BFTT supports both individual unit level and integrated force level training including joint, as well as providing an organic training capability to support requirements defined in the Surface Force Training Manual.
  Additionally, the installation of a realistic shipboard team training capability supports infrastructure to the ships.
  
  The BFTT system is a highly flexible, interactive simulation/stimulation tactical combat training system.  It addresses all warfare areas and provides through an open architecture, scenario generation and control, simulation of friendly and enemy forces and stimulation of organic shipboard sensors, data acquisition, reconstruction, and operator/unit performance feedback, and connectivity with external scenario control and communication.  

  PEO IWS 7C requires ITS/BFTT systems for installation on naval vessels and selected shore sites. 

  The production effort will include the procurement of parts and components, and the assembly, integration, testing, labeling, storage, and delivery of ITS/BFTT.
  A limited number of pre-manufactured components procured from other vendors will be supplied as Government-Furnished Material (GFM) for integration and installation into ITS/BFTT.  

  An ITS/BFTT unit consists of three militarized 19-inch standard equipment racks, populated with various Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and GFM components, as follows:  One (1) BFTT Operator Processor Console (BOPC) rack, one (1) populated Equipment Rack 1 (ER 1), and one (1) populated Equipment Rack 2 (ER 2).    

  Additional information to consider when responding to this request for information:
	The Government will provide production level drawings and 3-D models in SolidWorks  format as GFI.
	The Government will provide system specifications, documentation, part numbers and system operational test procedures.
	The completed systems must meet US Navy requirements for shipboard installation including environment and shock.
	Additional technical support services such as production engineering, system design, and logistical expertise will be required.
	Production requirements may vary from one (1) unit to twenty-four (24) unit per year.

  Interested firms should identify and describe in sufficient detail their experience in parts procurement, logistics or supply chain management, assembling, integrating and testing shipboard or other similar electronic rack mounted equipment; and ability to provide the additional technical support services required and identified above.

  Your response may be evaluated by non-government Contractor Support Personnel who have signed non-disclosure agreements.
  NAVSEA will accept submissions marked Business Sensitive.  NAVSEA will only accept e-mail requests for additional information sent to David.Krute@navy.mil.  NAVSEA will not accept telephone communications for additional information.

  NAVSEA makes no commitment to issue a solicitation, award a contract or be responsible to pay for any information provided and no basis for claims against the Government shall arise for any monies expended by any interested parties in responding to this market research. 

  If a decision to proceed is made by NAVSEA the estimated timeframe is as follows: Solicitation Release  July 2011; Award  March 2012; FAT  July 2012; FRP  October 2012.  Note:  These are estimates only and subject to change.

  Interested firms are requested to submit a capabilities statement of no more than 6 pages in length, including any photographs or drawings, within 15 days of the date of this posting.
 Submissions must include company name, size classification, address, point-of-contact, as well as any unique qualifiers identified below. 

  Capability statements must be submitted electronically in Microsoft Word format (Office 2007 or earlier) or Portable Document Format (PDF) to the following email address: David.Krute@navy.mil  

  The NAICS classification for this potential requirement is 334511 which has an employment size standard of 750 employees average over one (1) year.  Small business concerns that comply with the aforementioned size classification are encouraged to respond, indicating their status under the subordinate subcategories, if applicable, e.g., as small disadvantaged small business, women-owned small business, disabled veteran-owned small business, etc.

<DESC>THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL NOTICE ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE PROGRAM SUPPORT (PSC) TASK ORDERS.


	The purpose of this program is to maintain a comprehensive understanding and awareness of current and impending innovations and technology trends related to health information technology (HIT). 
	
	An increasingly vibrant industry is developing a range of innovative technological approaches.  Some of these will quickly disappear from the marketplace; others will precipitate modest changes; a few will have revolutionary impact.  One thing in this field is certain: the technology of 2015 will be very different from that available today.  
	
	With the Federal government making multi-billion dollar investments supporting health technology, it is imperative that programs and policies align with and take full advantage of technological advancement.
	
This program will facilitate information exchange between the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), key subject-matter experts, and HIT innovators and developers.  

This exchange will furnish ONC and other HHS agencies, including CMS and AHRQ, with continual updates on the development of the most promising HIT innovations that may support the achievement of meaningful use and the adoption of health IT, as well as key programmatic efforts that will be affected by technological advances. 

This exchange will enable the systematic identification of HIT innovations addressing areas of care delivery where critical problems are not being addressed as well as the early identification of emerging, breakthrough advances that may shape policy and technology initiatives.

<DESC>The Program Support Center, division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Dixie Butler of Butler Consulting.
<p>Statement of Work</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Division of Community Programs (DCP) is a component of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the lead Federal agency providing substance abuse and mental health services. DCP is a part of SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) which provides national leadership in the Federal effort to prevent alcohol, tobacco, and other drug problems. CSAP's mission is to improve the accessibility and quality of substance abuse prevention services nationwide. CSAP discretionary grant programs and services to communities are intended to strengthen the quality and availability of prevention services throughout the nation. <br /><br />OBJECTIVE<br />The objective of this purchase order is to obtain administrative and data support for DCP's discretionary grant activities of the Drug Free Communities (DFC) Support Program to enable timely completion of the 2011 grants process. DCP seeks assistance in data-related activities of extracting information from grant applications and data systems to prepare documents and reports sent to ONDCP and congressional staff; data entry; and performing quality control checks of data and information.</p>
<p>The Drug Free Communities (DFC) Support Program is a complex grant program which has unique requirements beyond Federal SAMHSA grant program requirements. It is a large program that receives and processes a high volume of grant applications and must meet the quick turnaround mandatory deadlines of the Federal HHS grant process to issue grant awards in a timely manner. In addition, since the DFC is an ONDCP program which is jointly managed by ONDCP and SAMHSA, it also has unique quick turnaround reporting requirements, mandatory deadlines and sudden shifting deadlines to meet ONDCP and Congressional staff time frames. The objective of this purchase order is to obtain a consultant who has knowledge of the processes, requirements and challenges of the DFC program and expertise in using SAMHSA's Grants Information Management System (SGIMS). <br />LOCATION</p>

<DESC>***FOR A BETTER FORMAT VIEW, PLEASE SEE ATTACHMENT ENTITLED 2011 BAA ANNOUNCEMENT AFCEEBAA-11-002***
<p>Broad Agency Announcement for Innovative Technologies and Methodologies for Reducing Various Environmental Problems<br />General Information<br />Document Type: Re-posting<br />Solicitation Number: AFCEEBAA-11-002<br /><br />Reference: AFCEEBAA-11-001 dated November 2, 2010<br />Refrence: AFCEEBAA-08-001 dated March 27, 2008<br />Posted Date: 29 Mar 11</p>
<p>Notes:<br />This is the second solicitation to FY11 BAA announcement based off the previous announcement AFCECCBAA-11-001 dated November 2, 2010. If an Offeror would like to be reconsidered under this announcement, please re-submit a new or revised white paper as stated below.</p>
<p>Synopsis/Announcement:<br />This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Technical Division (TD), Technology Transfer Program under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to accelerated closure of environmental sites across the Air Force, eliminate or reduce hazardous material use and environmental release, and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Restoration, Compliance Restoration, Pollution Prevention, and Military Munitions Response Programs. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field (i.e. a service). The areas of need for this announcement are:<br /><br />1. Restoration Program:<br /><br />a. Emerging Contaminants: Proposals should include innovative treatment technologies such as applied in situ bioremediation, chemical oxidation, chemical reduction, or other innovative technologies that specifically address emerging contaminants. Emerging contaminants can be considered those chemicals currently on the Department of Defense Chemical and Material Risk Management Directorate's Emerging Contaminants Action and Watch lists, USEPA's Candidate Contaminant List, and other contaminants that have potential Air Force implications pending future regulations. Specific needs relate to emerging contaminant exposure pathways, emerging contaminant treatment technologies, and the assessment of Air Force-wide impacts from future, or changing regulations regarding the detection of emerging contaminants in soils and groundwater. Example emerging contaminants of interest include but are not limited to: 1,4-dioxane, perfluorinated compounds, and hexavalent chromium.<br /><br />b. Clorinated Pesticides: Proposals should include innovative in situ treatment technologies for surface/shallow soil systems that specifically address chlorinated pesticides. Example chlorinated pesticides include: chlordane, aldrin, and dieldrin.</p>
<p>2. Pollution Prevention Program:<br /><br />a. Air Quality: Proposals should identify new or innovative technologies or control methodologies which are expected to generate feasible but substantial reductions in air pollutants of concern. Typical proposals have focused on material substitutions, process modifications, control technologies, and equipment modifications or substitutions. Additionally, proposals may address monitoring or emission quantification methods in a manner which can reduce the frequency at which monitoring is required, or the level of AF response. Proposals should not be limited to traditional CAA criteria and hazardous air pollutants and should provide additional considerations for the reduction of greenhouse gases and emerging contaminants.<br /><br />b. Hazardous Materials: Proposals should identify opportunities to eliminate or reduce the release of hazardous chemicals or minimize the regulatory burden and cost associated with the use and life-cycle management of hazardous materials. Proposals should include quantifiable measurement for either reduced chemical use or release, achievement of Executive Order 13514 goals, and total process operational cost. Specific needs relate to chemical releases reported under EPCRA Toxic Release Inventory requirements and hazardous waste stream reduction opportunities. These include, but are not limited to the reduction of air emissions from coal during plating operations, the reduction in nitrate releases from wastewater treatment operations, the use of hazardous materials and the generation of waste during painting, depainting, and plating operations. Proposals involving Air Force Weapon Systems may be considered ONLY if compatible with existing technical order and specification requirements for targeted systems/component. The BAA process is not intended to otherwise replace technical qualification to weapon system specifications. Rather, for Air Force Weapon Systems, it is meant to transition qualified technologies for demonstration and validation to further quantify hazardous material reductions and process efficiencies.<br /><br />c. Water Quality: Proposals should identify new or innovative technologies for drinking water treatment / distribution, wastewater treatment / collection, and stormwater pollutant controls. Items of specific interest for military public water systems include early contaminant detection and isolation, disinfection optimization controls / methods, detection levels of emerging contaminants, point-of-use fluoridation, and emergency water supply technologies. For wastewater, technologies that use low energy and significantly reduced maintenance to recycle grey water for building landscape irrigation are needed. For stormwater, the Air Force is interested in proposals that use energy efficient low maintenance technologies to reuse stormwater from roofs, parking lots, runways and other impervious surfaces. Compliance approaches and techniques to satisfy the Energy Independence and Security Act Section 438 requirements that do not build retention and detention systems for both the project and federal property level.</p>
<p>Eligible Offeror/Applicants: This requirement is restricted to US companies only. Foreign participants and/or individuals may participate as subcontractors to the extent that such participants comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Control Laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Acquisition Overview: The BAA process includes two phases of submittals:</p>
<p>Phase I - submit a 2 page online form (white paper/pre-proposal) at <br />http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa</p>
<p>Phase II - if invited, submit a full proposal that details the technology, the demonstration, and validation approach, and the costs for the proposed effort.</p>
<p>Relevant forms, samples and guides are found on FedBizOps and the AFCEE BAA Website. Evaluation criteria for Phase I are included in the proposal instruction document provided in this announcement. The anticipated award of AFCEEBAA-11-002 is Fiscal Year 11, 4 Quarter.</p>
<p>How to Apply: All Phase I white papers must be submitted as an online form and can be accessed through AFCEE's website (http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa.) Each electronic submission shall address only one area of need and shall be in accordance with this announcement. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 20 APRIL 2011. Phase I submittals received after 20 April 2011 will be handled according to the rules under FAR52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>Evaluation/Notification: Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the selection criteria included with the proposal instructions. It is critical that proposals convey the requested information accurately and concisely to facilitate their review. Offerors whose proposals are judged innovative and that meet Air Force needs (as indicated in the Phase I evaluation criteria) are notified electronically via email to submit a proposal to Phase II (request for proposal); those not selected are notified accordingly. Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are sent a Request for Proposal Package in an electronic notification (sent to the Key Personnel Contact listed in Phase I) by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted. To be eligible for an award, submission of Phase I is required. Award may be made with or without discussion.<br /><br />Please direct all question of a contracting and technical nature to the Point of Contacts below to help facilitate better coordination.

Test operate the engines after overhaul using the ship's dockside hotel load for a period not less than two hours. Test all alarm and shutdown systems prior to starting. Ship's force will line up and start engines and engage the generators on the ship's main bus. Operate engines at no-load until normal no-load operating temperatures are reached, then increase load incrementally up to full load and operate for one hour. Provide technicians to observe operation, verify joints are leak-free, make adjustments, and record teat data. <br />3.7.2 Temperatures and pressures shall be monitored and compared to manufacturer's recommended limits. If a temperature or pressure exceeds or falls below manufacturer's recommended upper or lower limits, testing shall be stopped and the cause determined and corrected before continuing. <br />3.7.3 Record the following information near the end of the full-load test; provide test instruments as required: <br />a. cylinder exhaust temperatures<br />b. lube oil temperatures<br />c. water temperatures<br />d. fuel oil pressure<br />e. lube oil pressure<br />f. electrical load on generator prime mover<br />g. turbo outlet air pressure <br />3.7.4 Submit a report of all test data collected. Report shall include manufacturer's recommended limits for each parameter measured. <br />3.8 Final Adjustments and Tune-up. <br />3.8.1 After satisfactory completion of operational testing, reset valves and accomplish final adjustments and tune-ups as required to provide smooth, efficient, and reliable operation. <br />3.9 Notes. <br />3.9.1 American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) inspection of 10,000 hour overhauls is required for credit toward the ship's Continuous Machinery Survey. Contractor shall inform ABS of progress and arrange for inspections as required by the local office. Government will pay for ABS fees associated with the inspections under a separate purchase order. <br />3.9.2 Ship's force is available to provide shipboard crane service during normal working hours (M-F 0830-1530) to lift parts between the pier and the ship's aft deck. 24 hours advance notice is required. Actual rigging of parts and moving parts to/from the aft deck and generator room shall be the responsibility of the contractor. <br />3.9.2 Reference 2.1 will be available for review during scheduled pre-bid inspection and during the performance period of the contract. References 2.2 through 2.4 shall be contractor furnished. Reference 2.5 follows this specification as an attachment. <br />END OF SPECIFICATION <br />Reference 2.5 GENERATOR ALIGNMENT PROCEDURE <br />The Contractor shall take the following readings before disassembly: <br />a. generator fan angular deflection, <br />b. generator shaft runout (TIR), <br />c. crankshaft end play, <br />d. crankshaft deflection. <br />Above readings shall be taken again upon reassembly, after the generator to engine alignment relationships have been re-established. <br />Record all results on condition reports and report the results to the attending NOAA Port Engineer, or assigned representative.</p>
<p>Before performing the parallel and angular alignment checks, ensure that the natural clearance between the base and its foundation is properly gapped with shims at all mounting locations and check that all base-to-foundation bolts are tightened to their final torque. If deflection of the base is noted, loosen base-to-foundation bolts at affected locations, shim as necessary to eliminate deflection, and re-tighten base-to-foundation bolts to their final torque.</p>
<p>Inability to attain repeatability of readings may be due to cocking of the flywheel by the turning tool. An end-supporting turning tool has proven to be superior to free-gear types for taking these particular reading. If an end-supported tool is not available, good results are attainable with a free-gear type if tooth engagement is reduced to the bare minimum necessary to turn the flywheel. <br />The deflection dial indicator must not have a leash attached since it may change readings.</p>
<p>PARALLEL ALIGNMENT (SHAFT RUNOUT) <br />Ensure that the generator shaft surface, which is to be measured with the dial indicator, is clean. Solvent and or light sanding with emery cloth should remove any dirt or rust accumulation. <br />Place the base of a dial indicator on the uppermost generator adaptor frame rib and position the indicator finger, which requires extensions, on the generator shaft. Preliminary readings can be taken on the coupling; final readings will be taken on the shaft only. Zero the dial indicator at the 12 o'clock position. It is essential to ensure that the dial indicator base does not move during the run-out check. Any movement will result in erroneous readings. <br />Rotate the shaft one revolution starting at the 12 o'clock position, checking and recording the dial indicator readings every 90 degrees. To validate the readings, at the completion of the revolution, the dial indicator must return to 0 at the original 12 o'clock starting position. In order to ensure accuracy, repeatability of the readings must be obtained for two consecutive revolutions of the shaft. Desired reading is 0.000 inch. Total indicator readings shall not exceed .005 inches. Adjust drive flex plate pack (discs) to flywheel installation as necessary to bring parallel alignment into tolerance. <br />Adjustment is accomplished by changing the diesel engine flywheel to generator drive flex plate pack relationship. If total indicator readings exceed 0.005 inches, adjustment is accomplished by removing the drive flex plate pack to flywheel bolts and turning the engine flywheel with the turning gear. The generator can be prevented from rotating with the engine by installing a capscrew in the generator coupling and then holding the generator with a 36" long pinch bar or angle iron placed on the capscrew and generator web. The engine to flywheel relationship is changed one or more bolt holes at a time. Reinstall the drive flex plate pack to flywheel bolts and take runout readings. Adjust as necessary to bring TIR readings into tolerance.</p>
<p>GENERATOR ANGULAR ALIGNMENT <br />Place a deflection dial indicator at the 12 o'clock position between the forward face of the fan and the drive flex plate at a point as far away as possible from the centerline of the shaft. The contact points for the deflection dial indicator fingers should be lightly punch marked. <br />Starting at the 12 o'clock position, rotate the shaft one revolution checking and recording readings every 90 degrees. To validate readings, at the completion of the revolution, the deflection dial indicator must return to zero at the 12 o'clock starting position. In order to ensure accuracy, repeatability of the readings must be obtained for two consecutive revolutions of the shaft. <br />Desired generator angular alignment readings are as follows: <br />12 O'CLOCK: 0.000 (starting point) 3 O'CLOCK: 0.000 TO +0.004 6 O'CLOCK: 0.000 TO +0.008 9 O'CLOCK: 0.000 TO +0.004 12 O'CLOCK: 0.000 (original starting point) <br />Adjust as necessary to bring angularity readings into compliance with paragraph 3 above. If adjustment is effected, a final set of angularity readings must be obtained after all bolts securing the generator to the engine and the generator to base are tightened to their final torque. <br />CRANKSHAFT DEFLECTION <br />Measure between faces of connecting rod throws of the crankshaft next to the center main bearing #4 and within .250 in. of the counterweight in accordance with Caterpillar Instructions. Record readings.</p>
<p>CRANKSHAFT END PLAY <br />Measure crankshaft end play in accordance with Caterpillar instructions. Record readings.</p>
<p>OBSERVANCE OF LEGAL HOLIDAYS AND SITE CLOSURE INFORMATION<br />The Contractor hereby agrees to observe the following Federal holidays, plus any other day off work designated by Federal Statute, by Executive Order, or by Presidential proclamation:<br />New Year's Day Labor Day<br />Martin Luther King's Birthday Columbus Day<br />President's Day Veteran's Day<br />Memorial Day Thanksgiving Day<br />Independence Day Christmas Day</p>
<p>When any holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday is observed; when any holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday is observed. All personnel assigned to this contract shall limit their observation of holidays to those set forth above.</p>
<p>In each instance, the Contractor agrees to continue to provide sufficient personnel to perform requirements of any critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be guided by the instructions issued by the Contracting Officer or the MIC. In the event of a site dismissal or closure due to weather, emergency or other circumstances, the contractor is instructed to contact the MIC or Alternate MIC for guidance.</p>
<p>The Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) requirements of Clause 1352.239-72 do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OFDA's Office of the Director assists the Director and Deputy Director with tracking trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field, recommends strategies for action, and maintains global relationships with USAID implementing partners and other donors. OFDA's Humanitarian Policy and Multi-lateral Affairs team comprises senior Humanitarian Advisors located in Brussels, Geneva, New York and Rome coordinated by OFDA/Washington's Office of the Director. Currently, OFDA operates a small office in Geneva, Switzerland which is responsible for working closely with United Nations (UN) agencies, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) / International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), nongovernmental organization (NGO) fora, and donors on a range of humanitarian issues. As one of the critical "humanitarian capitals of the world," Geneva is the venue for key discussions on policy issues directly related to OFDA's activities, such as reform of the international humanitarian system, best practices in financing humanitarian programs and disaster management as well as for donor initiatives on improving the effectiveness of humanitarian aid. USAID/OFDA is seen within the Geneva-based international community as a leader in the field of humanitarian affairs based on its expertise in policy and delivery of assistance, an extensive field network, large humanitarian budget, and its engagement with a wide variety of international and local partners.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Humanitarian Advisor based at USUN in Geneva, Switzerland to provide support to USUN and ensure that USAID objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting on humanitarian issues, and situational analysis on humanitarian policy issues are met and coordinated closely.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Advisor serves as a key source of information on humanitarian issues and humanitarian policy for USUN Geneva. He/She will help plan USUN strategies and responses to humanitarian crises, actively lobby members of UN delegations on U.S. positions on humanitarian issues, provide effective liaison with the UN offices in Geneva, and anticipate and prepare documents and briefing memos on humanitarian issues for important meetings and events. The Humanitarian Advisor will also raise critical issues with the UN on behalf of OFDA, DCHA offices and other U.S. Government (USG) agencies and must have the ability to multi-task. The assignment involves providing expert analytical and advisory support on humanitarian issues for the planning, development and execution of U.S. foreign policy within a broad and complex geographic or functional specialty area. The work requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data and the Humanitarian Advisor will receive general guidance but will be expected to execute independent judgment and analysis.</p>
<p>Contacts will be within the USG, as well as personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in UN and other agencies, experts, and representatives of non-governmental organizations. The role requires significant interaction with foreign delegates, demanding strong diplomatic and communication skills to accurately represent U.S. positions in a complex multilateral setting, based on guidance from Washington. Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings, including open meetings, conferences, and negotiating sessions, where the Humanitarian Advisor may be called upon to explain and defend U.S. positions on humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>The position requires extensive experience with and a thorough understanding of the international humanitarian assistance environment, operations, related policies, regulations, and inter-relationships between the USG, donor and other international organizations.</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Advisor will work out of the USUN Mission in Geneva, Switzerland and will report to OFDA's Senior Humanitarian Policy Advisor in OFDA/Washington as well as the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) in Geneva. The Humanitarian Advisor will serve as USAID's principal in-country point of contact for humanitarian issues in Geneva. The Humanitarian Advisor's duties and responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide leadership for the identification, research, analysis and development of recommendations on all issues and matters relating to humanitarian affairs and anticipate the need for such policy analysis.<br />&bull; Represent USAID at donor meetings covering a broad range of humanitarian issues and provide DCHA Bureau with analysis and guidance on relations with the UN system.<br />&bull; As part of an interagency team working on humanitarian issues in the Office of Refugees and Migration Affairs (RMA) Section at USUN Geneva, interact with State Department colleagues on developing strategies and policies toward UN agencies and issues.<br />&bull; Anticipate the needs at USUN Geneva regarding developments in the areas of humanitarian affairs and prepare analyses, briefings, documents and meetings as required.<br />&bull; Attend various UN, USUN, UN Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) Donor Support Group (ODSG), Humanitarian Liaison Working Group (HLWG) and other meetings and provide authoritative information and views to formulate humanitarian policies and coordinate strategies on policy issues.<br />&bull; Initiate and maintain strong working relationships with other diplomatic missions in order to promote humanitarian principles and coordinate disaster response activities.<br />&bull; Develop and maintain cooperative working relationships with other USUN components and relevant USG offices and serve as an expert point of contact for these groups in the area of humanitarian affairs. Typical contacts are the Chief of Mission, high level officials of the UN agencies and senior representatives of foreign governments. The incumbent will influence policy.<br />&bull; Represent DCHA on specific humanitarian issues of concern with UN agencies in Geneva and convey demarche messages as needed.<br />&bull; Represent USAID at meetings with the UN, international organizations, and other donors and other conferences sponsored by members of the international community, and provides guidance and advice on USG positions, negotiating strategies, and, in consultation with USAID/Washington, conducts negotiations with the donor community and make recommendations to the appropriate officials in USAID.<br />&bull; Work with counterparts in other donor organizations in Geneva at the most senior levels, particularly those represented in the Humanitarian Liaison Working Group, to exchange information, establish meetings on specific donor issues, solicit publications, and collect information on training opportunities; coordinate these activities with relevant USAID officers.<br />&bull; Disseminate relevant USAID/OFDA guidelines and information and act as OFDA's general point of contact for international donor appeals and other documentation from the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Federation of the Red Cross and other agencies based in Geneva. Respond to inquiries and be familiar with their operational procedures.<br />&bull; Advise USAID/OFDA staff on issues regarding donations and requests for USG support and information sharing from private and public interest groups, including those formed on an ad hoc basis during disaster assistance operations.<br />&bull; Serve on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and represent USAID in field visits and assessments as appropriate and when requested by USAID/OFDA.<br />&bull; Act as a liaison between the USUN Mission and other offices within DCHA including the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on food security and maternal child health nutrition issues for emergency, non-emergency and developmental relief activities.<br />&bull; Provide informational updates and analysis as necessary on activities undertaken by WHO, OCHA, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and ICRC on food security issues which have a humanitarian focus that will drive policy debates in the USG interagency arena.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Humanitarian Advisor at USUN is part of the Humanitarian Policy and Multi-lateral Affairs Team in the Office of the OFDA Director and will report to the OFDA/Washington Senior Humanitarian Policy Advisor. The Geneva-based position will also concurrently report to the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) and be located in the RMA Section at USUN. For many activities, the Humanitarian Advisor will also coordinate closely with USG personnel in Geneva. The Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will concurrently be through USAID/Washington and the USUN Mission, but the Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The OFDA/OD Senior Humanitarian Policy Advisor in Washington will provide direction in terms of policy guidance, program goals and objectives to ensure consistent guidance on humanitarian issues across other USUN Missions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p><br />*** 29 March 2011 ***</p>
<p>Revised Purchase Description, REV. 1 has also been posted to the site.</p>
<p>Questions/Comments and Responses</p>
<p>The Scope states the Press will be used to calibrate scales with capacities of 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 and 60,000 lbf from 10% to 100% of capacity. This implies the minimum force required to be applied will be 500 lbf. Paragraph 2.2 and 3.1 require the Press shall have a continuous operating range of 0 - 60,000 lbf minimum. It is not possible to build a hydraulic press that will meet the requirements of the Purchase Description when working at very low forces. Since the minimum force at which the Press will be used is 500 lbf (10% of a 5,000 lbf load cell) should the operating range be 500 - 60,000 lbf?</p>
<p><br />RESPONSE: The press must be able to be continuously operated from 0 to 60,000 lbf, while the accuracy is required from 500 to 60,000 lbf. There is no error.</p>
<p><br />Paragraph 2.3.1.1.1 requires the load cells be calibrated in accordance with ASTM E74-06 including zero. Paragraph 7.2.1 of ASTM E74-06 states, "In no case should the smallest force applied be below the theoretical lower limit of the instrument as defined by the values: 400 x resolution for Class A loading range and 2000 x resolution for Class AA." This excludes zero from being included in calibration and analysis of data according to ASTM E74-06.</p>
<p>The two most recognized and used force calibration procedures are ASTM E74 and ISO 376 both exclude zero as a calibrated force. These procedures are written and reviewed by experts in the field of force calibration, including scientists from National Metrology Laboratories, such as NIST-USA and PTB- Germany. Neither ASTM E74 or ISO 376 permit the use of an instrument below the lowest non zero force applied at the time of calibration. This requirement is based on calibrating a load cell at forces less than 10% of its rated capacity assures the fitting of the calibration equation when the load cell is used below 10%.</p>
<p>Another problem with using zero in the calibration equation is how zero is treated. According to Paragraph 8.1 of ASTM E74 deflection is defined as the difference between the reading under applied force and the average zero-force reading . Deflection is a net value and the zero-force reading will be a perfect zero for all three calibration runs. This will tend to artificially lower the standard deviation of the load cell.</p>
<p>Based on internationally recognized force calibration procedures it is not appropriate to include zero-force readings in the calculation and analysis of data and the calculation of the standard deviation of the load cell.</p>
<p><br />RESPONSE: The load cells shall be calibrated with a zero. The applicable calibration points must meet the requirements listed in your applicable uncertainty analysis. This document is not stating that the 0 must meet a specific requirement, but it will be used during calibration. No change will be made to the PD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paragraph 2.3.1.2.1 requires the temperature effect on the load cell's zero for a change of 1 degree C and paragraph 2.3.1.3.1 requires the temperature effect on the load cell's actual rated output for a change of 1 degree C be included in the uncertainty analysis. Paragraph 4.3.1 states the Press will be operated in an ambient temperature of 67 to 79 degrees F. Since most force calibrations are referenced to a temperature of 23 degrees C the temperature will vary from 23 by -3.6 degrees C to +3.1 degrees C. Since the environment in which the press operates varies by more than 1 degree C the contribution to the uncertainty due to changes in temperature effect on zero and rated output should be based on a change of 3.6 degrees C.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Uncertainty budget shall be changed to reflect a maximum change of 3.6 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paragraph 2.4 requires the display shall be in pounds force. Many displays use a multiple point linearization to convert the load cell output to read in pounds force. Paragraph 2.3.1.1.3 requires the utilization of a second or third degree polynomial fit. The Purchase Description should require the displayed value be pounds force calculated using coefficients determined from the force and deflection values obtained in the calibration and the calibration equation for the proper degree of polynomial used to determine the standard deviation.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: You are correct. If the cells are calibrated without an indicating device at the primary lab, then a second or third degree polynomial will be used. Then an additional error shall be included in the uncertainty analysis for using selected points from the polynomial calculation.</p>
<p><br />Paragraph 3.3.1 refer to "Shift Test IAW NIST Handbook 44's Section 3". Section 3 of 2010 Handbook 44 deals with Liquid-Measuring Devices. What is the correct reference for the "Shift Test"?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: This is a typographical error; it should say Shift Test in Section 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paragraph 3.4.1 requires a mounting fixture and indicator be supplied with each unit to verify perpendicularity. It further states the indicator will be used with an Air Force owned 18 inch Granite Square. Does each destination have a granite square?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Yes, each testing laboratory has an 18 inch Granite square.</p>
<p><br />Paragraph 4.1.3 includes a requirement for decreasing force. No reference to decreasing force is made elsewhere in the Purchase Description.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: This is an error. There should only be a requirement for an increasing force. This was only meant as a status, but due to the use of the equipment, the words have been removed from the PD.</p>
<p><br />Paragraph 4.1.5.2.1 refers to Brand Name or equal ECS Composites Part Number 00017529 revision B. These cases are extremely expensive. Are Pelican Cases satisfactory?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Offerors are allowed to submit cases that are Brand Name or equal but must provide supporting documentation showing the case meets specifications of the Brand Name ECS Composites Part Number 00017529 revision B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a requirement for a 5 year warranty. We can offer five years on the frame, but not on the hydraulic seals or electronics.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: There will be no change to the warranty. The 5 year warranty is required for all items in the system.</p>

<SUBJECT>84--Requirement clarifications for the PVS-23 Helmet Mount for PASGT helmet.
<SOLNBR>W15P7T11RH442
<ARCHDATE>03282012
<CONTACT>Terry Beth Clark, 443-861-4670

<a href="mailto:terry.beth.clark@us.army.mil">CECOM Contracting Center (CECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>Question #1: Regards solicitation W15P7T-11-R-H442, I assume you may have had some questions on this, but allow me to also ask what you are actually looking for on this solicitation? Appears from the SOW, that you want helmet mounts for AN/PVS-23, however, the part number identified as 3256368 does not support the AN/PVS-23. It does support the AN/PVS-7 (and AN/PVS-14).The AN/PVS-23 is a binocular night vision system and is supported at the helmet mount with a different mount. The correct part number for the helmet mount assembly for the AN/PVS-23 is 273270-1 (for ACH helmets) or 274742-1 (for PASGT helmets). <br><br>Answer # 1: The procurement is for 30 each PVS-23 helmet mount for the PASGT helmet.<br><br>Question # 2: The SOW ends at section 3.8 although the table of contents list ends at 3.11. Were 3.9 to 3.11 omitted intentionally?<br><br>Answer # 2: This was an error and the new SOW sections 3.9-3.11 has been removed because we are only buying helmet mounts.<br><br>Question# 3: The solicitation calls for: "Rugged Helmet Mount to support AN/PVS- 23 to the US PASGT Helmet". Nevertheless, there are so many variations of helmet mounts, and we don't know what the customer currently has on their helmets.  For instance, it's possible that they already have the receiving plate/shroud attached to their helmets and all they need is the front mount that attaches to the plate/shroud.  It could also be that they don't have anything on their helmets and require the complete Ratchet Strap Shroud & Mount.   <br><br>Answer #3: We are buying the whole package which includes Strap Assembly for PASGT helmet and Helmet Mount for the AN/PVS-23 that attaches to the Strap Assembly.   <br><br><br> <br>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer questions from contractors interested in this procurement and to provide answers to these questions.  There will also be two (2) attachments to this modification.  The questions and answers are the following:<br><br>Question 1: Drawing RHINO-SM-5001 sheet 1 of 4 on note 3 makes reference to "silk screen white per drawing K5051.  I do not see this drawing.  Also, note 2 makes reference to overspray being allowed on internal service which I take to mean that only the outside surface of the box is painted.  Is this assumption correct?  Answer:  Yes, only the outside of the box needs painted  Overspray is allowed on the inside of the box except for the grounding terminal location (Loc. 2B "NO PAINT INSIDE").  Drawing K5051 has already been attached to the previous modification for this solicitation.<br><br>Question 2:  I have read your response stating a weekly production rate of 25/100 per month.  How many days are allowed between contract award and the first 25 units to be delivered.  Also, will the 400 minimum units be ordered at one time or IDIQ'd over 12 months.  Answer:  After the first article testing 30 days for delivery of the first 25 the Government would need 25 a week for the next 4 months. 100/month for 4 months @ 25/week.<br><br>Question 3:  The drawings has one semi-assembled part shown and 3 parts (Front, Back & Top).  No Bottom part.  Answer:  Page 4 of 4 shows both top and bottom.<br><br>Question 4:  The CLINS indicate 5 items and we cannot identify the 5th item.  The part numbers in the description are all thle same, but from the assembly drawing there appears to be only four parts: Front, Back, Bottom & Top.  Please identify the 5th part.  Answer:  CLINS 0001 through 4001 does not mean there are five parts.  CLIN 0001 = Base Year, CLIN 1001 = Option Year One, CLIN 2001 = Option Year two, CLIN 3001 = Option Year three, CLIN 4001 = Option Year Four.  This designates the years of the contract.  Additionally, there are 4 fabricataed parts (Front, Rear, Base & Lid) and two purchased parts (NAS1919B05-04, Blind Rivet & 94648A340 #8-32 Captive Nut).  If we are missing something, please let us know.<br><br>Question 5:  The solicitation indicates a base year and option years, but no minimum or maximum quantities are identified for eacy of the options/years.  Answer:  The minimum for the base and four option years are  100 each and the maximum for the base and four option years are 2,500 each.<br><br>Question 6:  We also note that the Minimum and maximum quantities are not listed in the table.  Answer:  Again, the minimum quantities for the base and four option years are 100 each and the maximum quantities for the base and four option years are 2,500 each.  <br><br>A comment from the requiring activity is as follows:<br><br>It was noticed that the original paint prep note was incorrect.  It called for liquid paint option to be finished per 4.1, "5.1.1" (or 5.2).  5.1.1 is actually dippable zinc phosphate for steel.  It should actually be 7.3.1 which is a dippable alodine pretreat.  As mentioned above, attached is a revised drawing and a sheet that is used at Letterkenny which shows what the numbers represent.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Amendment #1
Questions submitted by vendor for solicitation 11-001592. Answers supplied by the government.

A.Base Notice/Solicitation Description Question

1.The solicitation states:
The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 812210 with a size standard size of $7.0 Million. SBA Defines the objective for the imposition of size standards as follows:
Size standards are critical in the government-contracting process because they ensure a level playing field for competition among small businesses of varying sizes. 
http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/contracting/contracting-officials/size-standards//

SBA SOP 90 01 4 entitled Size Determination Program and Review of Size Standards (http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/serv_tools_sop_90014.pdf) defines the process of firm revenue size determination as follows: (Chapter 5, Paragraph 3, Page 29)

How Do I Calculate Average Annual Receipts?
You must calculate average annual receipts by using the firms and its affiliates (bold and underline provided by writer) Federal income tax returns for the last 3 completed fiscal years divided by three.  Receipts mean gross or total income plus the cost of goods sold.  This includes receipts from rents, fees commissions, and other income.

a.Similar to the banking industry (which is used as an example in this publication), the funeral service industry is going through a transition of firm mergers, acquisitions, vertical integrations and consolidations.  Will the government utilize the above SOP defined aggregate receipt total for making bid eligibility determinations for this solicitation? 

ANSWER: THE OFFEROR MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR )AS A SMALL BUSINESS UNDER 812210.

	
B.Statement of Work Questions

1.Preparation of the Body:

The contractor shall pick-up the body within eight hours from the time of CC request.

a.Will the government include a provision to allow the contractor to request an extension to this time period due to Acts of God (e.g., a major snowstorm in the metropolitan Washington area)? 

ANSWER: YES. IF THE SPECIFIED TIMEFRAME CANNOT BE MET, THE CONTRACTOR MUST INFORM THE GOVERNMENT AND REQUEST AN EXTENSION TO THE TIME PERIOD.	

The contractor shall complete the preparation of the body within two (2) business days from the time of CC request unless religious and/or cultural traditions dictate a shorter timeframe.

b.The above statement is also included in paragraph 6 on page 2 under Scenario II.: Patient expires at the NIH Clinical Center and his/her remains are prepared and then transported to his/her home state/country.
 
c.Does this two (2) business day timeframe apply to overseas shipments which require the contractor to contact the recipient foreign embassy to schedule casket banding by their personnel prior to shipment?

ANSWER: THE SPECIFIED TIMEFRAME APPLIES, UNLESS THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAKE THAT TIMEFRAME IMPOSSIBLE (SUCH AS LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS). IF THE SPECIFIED TIMEFRAME CANNOT BE MET, THE CONTRACTOR MUST INFORM THE GOVERNMENT AND REQUEST AN EXTENSION TO THE TIME PERIOD.

Scenario I; Patient expires at the NIH Clinical Center and mortuary services are provided in the DC Metro Area

#3. Local Interment: (SOW page 2, paragraphs 3-5) there appears to be no mention of a headstone, identification or permanent gravesite marker for the deceased.

d.Does the government intend that a gravesite identification marker be supplied by the contractor? 

ANSWER: THIS WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SOW AND HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONSIDERED. THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED IN THE FUTURE AND MAY BE NEGOTIATED WITH THE AWARDEE.

e.If a gravesite marker is required, will the government require uniform identification, i.e., that the marker be engraved with the persons name, year of birth and year of death consistent with the cremation urn markings referenced in #4?  

ANSWER: THIS WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SOW AND HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONSIDERED. THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED IN THE FUTURE AND MAY BE NEGOTIATED WITH THE AWARDEE.


f.If a marker is required, what style (i.e. flat or upright, concrete or granite, size and specifications of the marker) must be supplied by the contractor and placed at the gravesite? 

ANSWER: THIS WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SOW AND HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONSIDERED. THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED IN THE FUTURE AND MAY BE NEGOTIATED WITH THE AWARDEE.

#4. Cremation (with Funeral Home Viewing Services, if requested):

Disposition of unclaimed cremains:  It would appear that the government would desire a procedure to treat unclaimed cremains in concert with those of a traditional body burial and also be consistent with the stated standards for polished metal etc.

A government defined final disposition of all cremains is essential to relieve the contractor of the liability for final disposition or perpetual storage of the cremains
  
g.Will the government define the final disposition of cremains in the contractors possession that have not been requested to be returned to the next of kin? 

ANSWER: YES. THE GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE REGARDING THE FINAL DISPOSITION OF CREMAINS IN THE CONTRACTORS POSSESSION THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REQUESTED TO BE RETURNED TO THE NEXT OF KIN TO THE AWARDEE UPON AWARD OF THE CONTRACT.

h.Will the government consider it appropriate to utilize a traditional burial or columbarium (niche) placement with external memorialization that includes the persons name, year of birth and year of death?  

ANSWER: NO

2.Scenario II; Patient expires at the NIH Clinical Center and his/her remains are prepared and transported to his/her home state/country:

a.Same question asked in 1 c. above.

ANSWER: THE SPECIFIED TIMEFRAME APPLIES, UNLESS THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAKE THAT TIMEFRAME IMPOSSIBLE (SUCH AS LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS). IF THE SPECIFIED TIMEFRAME CANNOT BE MET, THE CONTRACTOR MUST INFORM THE GOVERNMENT AND REQUEST AN EXTENSION TO THE TIME PERIOD.

How would you define an eligible survey respondent?

         Any business employing substantial numbers of Veterans

Can the Department of Veteran Affairs be identified as the sponsor of the research?

         Yes

What survey length should be assumed for pricing?

         It should be comprehensive

How many open-ended questions do you anticipate in the survey?

         Yes. VA will help to identify individuals and seek their participation.

         There should be plain English and technical components. Length is less 	   	   important than the comprehensive nature of the report.
 
The solicitation did not provide guidelines for proposal submission, for example, the not to exceed page limit for technical and cost proposals, the proposal evaluation methods. Can you provide this information?

	The proposal should be brief but comprehensive. There are no formal page limits. 

Does the VA have a list of companies they would like to participate in the study and survey specifically or is the VA looking for the contractor to provide this information?

	The contractor should provide this information.

Is there a not to exceed budget for this contract?  If so, what is the not to exceed amount?

	There is no "not to exceed" amount. 

Regarding past performance, are three references within the proposal sufficient or is there a form references need to complete?

How does the VA define small, mid-size and large?
	The definition of small businesses is well established. Large businesses might be defined 	by the 	contractor as Fortune 500 or Fortune 1000 companies or something equivalent. 	Mid-sized would be in-between.
Does the VA want to be able to analyze the results by size of company?
	If possible.

	Senior HR managers would be very appropriate as informants.
 Is the VA thinking of multiple people within the same company?

	Yes, but public sector employers should not be the majority of those included

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Intermittent, Washington, D.C.-based</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Program Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Program Advisor position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned. The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD), the Senior Transition Program Advisor will:</p>

When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;<br />&bull; Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;<br />&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;<br />&bull; Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials.<br />&bull; Identify or seek out non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, United States Government (USG) agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;<br />&bull; Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations; <br />&bull; Advise Senior Management and Team Leaders on budget processes and reviews, preparing justification documentation when necessary;<br />&bull; Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;<br />&bull; Serve as a liaison with other Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;<br />&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;<br />&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>

<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a</p>
<p>Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>EVALUATION and SELECTION CRITERIA: Submissions of completed Standard Forms 330 (SF-330) received in response to this notice will be evaluated by a government selection board in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks Act) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36 to determine the most highly qualified firms. Recent (within the past 5 years), relevant performance in preparing projects valued between $100,000 and $1,000,000 may result in a higher rating and should be addressed accordingly. Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less qualified. The primary factor for selection shall be the most qualified firm. The following is a detailed list of evaluation criteria.<br />(1) Professional Qualifications: Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance as demonstrated by education, experience, registration and management ability of personnel assigned to this contract and any applicable outside consultants.

The effectiveness of the proposed project team (management structure and coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors) is also considered. <br />(3) Capacity: The firm's available capacity of key disciplines and experience with similar size projects is evaluated. This evaluation may be based upon the amount of other work currently being performed by the A-E and the overall size of the firm.<br />(4) Past Performance: Past performance on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. References and letters of commendation are also evaluated.

This includes evaluation of a firm's ability to accurately project construction costs of project designs within established cost parameters. <br />(9). Design Capability: This includes evaluation of a firm's description of their quality control processes and a description of the management approach the firm would use on the contract if they were the successful offeror.</p>
<p>(10). Volume of Work: The firm's available capacity to handle work. This evaluation may be based upon the amount of other work currently being performed by the A-E and the overall size of the firm.</p>
<p>A-E firms, which meet the requirements described in this announcement, are invited to submit completed Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualification (required for this project). All information relating to the firms qualifications must be contained in the Standard Form. Inclusion by reference to other materials is not acceptable.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible firms capable of performing Design/Bid/Build construction services for ST 09-0339, Waterfront Repairs, Naval Submarine Base New London, Groton, Connecticut. 

This solicitation is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about April 11, 2011 with a proposal due date of approximately May 11, 2011 and an award date of approximately June 30, 2011.

The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, tools, parts supplies and transportation to perform all work described below.

Project description:  
This waterfront project provides restoration of the Marginal Wharf and portions of Pier 15 at the Naval Submarine Base in New London, Groton, Connecticut.
  The repairs will restore these structures to the original design load capacities and eliminate further deterioration of the wharf and pier.  The site consists of approximately 15,400 lf of marginal wharf which encompasses the entire waters edge of the Base.  The construction site is an active waterfront with numerous controls to limit accesses due to the nature of the submarine base security.  A limited lay-down area will be available to the contractor and therefore will require the contractor to use floating, access, storage and plant. 
The scope of work includes:

The 15,400 lf of Marginal Wharf provides the interface between the water and land and consist of various types of construction including pile supported (steel pipe, H and concrete piles) reinforced concrete deck relieving platforms, and steel sheet pile bulkheads.
  The project includes restoration of the structural elements including foundations.

Pier 15 is located perpendicular to the Marginal Wharf and provides support to the Bases floating dry-dock.  Structural restoration of the pier included both partial and full pile encasements and the installation of a new induced current cathodic protection system. The existing structure is posted for limited vehicular access and therefore will require waterside access for equipment and materials.
The Marginal Wharf also provides support to a utility trench system that parallels the edge of the Marginal Wharf.  Portions of the utility trench system require installation of new foundation piles and construction of a new reinforced concrete deck.
  Other sections of the utility trenches require replacement of their reinforced concrete trench covers. 
Other Waterfront Repairs will be include: concrete deck and beam restoration; structural and non structural pile encasements; recoating of bulkheads and other concrete and steel structural members; repair and or replacement of mooring hardware, and fender systems both timber and composite types; concrete deck sealing, pavement repairs; and repairs to deteriorated steel sheet pile bulkheads.  Work includes restoration of above and below water structures and will require the ability of performing work underwater. 
The period of performance for this construction project is 754 days from date of award.

The magnitude of this construction project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000 IAW DFARS 236.204.
  The RFP will be issued to obtain contractor qualifications for which a contract, by means of negotiated firm fixed-price procurement, will be awarded. 

The Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990.

The application of a scale of words will be used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for criteria evaluation. For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives. Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level. If at any level of indentation an Offer's submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for a criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory), the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation. Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level. The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<br><br>(i) Outstanding - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards. The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated. Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government. The offeror's qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government. The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract. Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements. There is a very high probability of success.<br><br>(ii) Above Average - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to exceed performance or capability standards. Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government. The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality. The offeror's qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements. The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government. The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements. Disadvantages are minimal. There is a high probability of success.<br><br>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral) - Information submitted demonstrate offeror's potential to meet performance or capability standards. The information represents an acceptable solution. Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas. A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved. The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements. No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral. There is a good probability of success.<br><br>(iv) Marginal - The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement. The offeror's interpretation of the Government's requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient. The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall submittal rating. The offeror's qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government. There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable. There are significant disadvantages.<br><br>(v) Unsatisfactory - The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards. Unacceptable. Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal. There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved. The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Government's requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements.

The application of a scale of words will be used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for a criteria evaluation factor. For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives. Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level. If at any level of indentation an Offers submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for the criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory),the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation. Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level. The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<br><br>(i) Outstanding - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards. The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated. Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government. The offeror's qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government. The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract. Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements. There is a very high probability of success.<br><br>(ii) Above Average - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to exceed performance or capability standards. Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government. The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality. The offeror's qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements. The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government. The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements. Disadvantages are minimal. There is a high probability of success.<br><br>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral) - Information submitted demonstrate offeror's potential to meet performance or capability standards. The information represents an acceptable solution. Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas. A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved. The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements. No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral. There is a good probability of success.<br><br>(iv) Marginal - The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement. The offeror's interpretation of the Governments requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient. The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement requirements. The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall project. The offeror's qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government. There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable. There are significant disadvantages.<br><br>(v) Unsatisfactory - The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards. Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal. There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved. The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Governments requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. There are very significant disadvantages.<br><br>5.

<AWARDEE>ManTech Security & Mission Assurance Corporation, 7799 Leesburg Pike Suite 700S
, Falls Church, VA 22043 US
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ negotiated on a non-competitive basis with MANTECH Security &amp; Mission Assurance Corporation, 7799 Leesburg Pike, STE 700S, Falls Church, VA 22043-2436 for Program Management Security Support Services for the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JSFPO). The Government procured the above service under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1, to ensure there will not be a break in the services required, while a competitive Seaport-e Task Order is being put in place. The period of performance on this procurement will be six months from date of award, with two (2) three-month option periods.
<p>The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) (F-35) program is a joint DoD ACAT 1D major acquisition program that includes the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps. JSF also includes eight foreign partner countries formally identified as Cooperative Partner Participants (CPP) along with two other countries called Security Cooperative Participants (SCP). Because of the international nature of the program, combined with the highly sensitive technologies being designed into the total air system, consolidated security support to ensure proper technology protection and dissemination is paramount in the execution of the JSF program. MANTECH Security &amp; Mission Assurance Corporation is currently supplying the support services for this requirement. It is in the Government's best interest to issue a new contract to MANTECH for a continuation of services. This will insure there will not be a break in the services required, which would be detrimental to the JSF Program. The impact of failing to award this continued support for the JSF program is both operational and financial. Protection of the critical technologies that distinguish the combat effectiveness of the JSF from legacy programs is essential to the security of the program and essential that the current support be maintained to continue to protect those technologies throughout the entire program life cycle, including deployment and sustainment. Any interruption to these services would cause the entire program to cease operations. Furthermore, there is a financial impact to disrupting the JSFPO Operations because a restart after a stoppage will lead to duplication of costs that will not be recovered.</p>
<p>This contract was awarded solely for the purpose to insure continuity of services to avoid interruption of program support. There is a competitive SEAPORT-e package in process for the contractor support service requirements. This sole source action is a temporary bridge for the continuation of services until the SEAPORT-e Task Order is in place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue an award under other than full and open competition and should not be considered a request for competitive proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The determination of the Government not to open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW <span style="COLOR: black">10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1):<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span>the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications: <br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" />Mark Logic Corporation is the only contractor capable of providing services of a comparable nature to those required under the unique circumstances of this contract action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The unique nature of a schema-less repository does not currently exist on the Global Information Grid. Mark Logic technical engineering support will provide the expertise necessary to complete the development and integration required for the operational utility assessment scheduled for June. A change to the technical engineering would adversely affect this milestone and negatively ripple to other enterprise services. This ripple would subsequently cost the government additional dollars to complete this task. The existing contract HC1047-09-P-4076 will expire on 29 March 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Mark Logic Server is already installed at the set demonstration site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Award to sources other than Mark Logic Corporation will require additional time to obtain the necessary specialized training, or certifications, and familiarity with Mark Logic Service software/ systems and product support, and will result in unacceptable delay in fulfilling the VCJCS's requirements.<br /><br />Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by providing detailed information of their capabilities and certifications to clearly meet the requirements stated above. The period of performance is 29 March 2011 through 15 May 2011 .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Response(s) may be via email on company letterhead: include company's name, point of contact, address, phone number, DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax ID, and business size.
