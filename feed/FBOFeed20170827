<p>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF INTENT</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />PURSUANT TO FAR Subpart 5.2-Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT TO ACTION.</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support Contracts and Simplified Acquisitions Branch (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order for Circadian Rhythm Tracking and Data Analysis.</p>
<p>EXTENT OF COMPETITION</p>
<p>This acquisition is full and open with no set-aside restrictions.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541990 -- All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services with associated business size standard $15,000,000.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-94,2005-95 / 01-19-2017.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures at an amount not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold inclusive of options.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>Project Description<br />The Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms' aim is to understand the development and role of atypical mammalian photoreceptors, melanosin-containing retinal ganglion cells, in non-image forming (NIF) visual functions. These functions include circadian photoentrainment, pupillary light reflex, sleep, and direct light effects on behavior. We will also explore the effects of light on learning, memory, and mood and the mechanism by which light activiates the melanopsin-containing cells. The main common tool used in all these studies is genetically mutated animal lines.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of this acquisition is to procure thirty (30) animal lines as double or triple mutant lines to record circadian rhythmic data retrieved from animal specimens based on their behaviors when exposed to both light and dark environments. These services are needed to directly replicate certain aspects of our existing research. We are currently unable to perform the services being requested due to the lack of laboratory and facility space in addition to constraints on the number of animals and the housing of these specimens would require to fulfill specific aspects in support of our research.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall:<br />1. Provide the husbandry and breeding service for 30 double or triple mutant animal lines.<br />2. Conduct genotyping for 30 double or triple mutant animal lines. The cost of PCR reagents will be included in this service order.<br />3. Precisely control and manage special lighting conditions as directed by the NIH.<br />4. Collect mouse wheel-running and body temperature data from 30 mutant lines under each special lighting condition designed for different circadian experiment.<br />5. Conduct multiple behavioral tests using 30 mutant animal lines under special lighting conditions as directed by the NIH. <br />6. Collect actogram data sets and animal specimens from each support task performed for further analysis.<br />7. Conduct routine immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and sequencing procedures on the animal specimens collected from these support task performed. The contractor shall provide for all reagents (for example antibodies, fluorescent probes, et al.) associated with this requirement.</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />The anticipated period of performance for this requirement will be effective on or around September 30, 2017 through September 29, 2018. The Government contemplates a firm fixed price purchase order.</p>
<p>CLOSING STATEMENT</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued on or about 09/08/2017 and bids or proposals will be tentatively due about 7 days after the solicitation release date.</p>
<p>Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from the Contract Specialist, Zenab Chowdhry, electronically at and must reference the solicitation number HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-PSOL-2017-736 on your electronic request. FAX requests are not accepted.</p>

NAICS 238990 applies, the small business size standard is $15 million.  The contractor shall Contractor shall provide and install camera servers and fiber cables and switches to ensure that our camera server and core are on new IT standards within 90 days ARO
Choosing another contractor to install this additional capability to the security system would result in additional administrative and  contractual costs that would almost certainly not  be offset by competition due to the re-work and learning curve of a new contractor.  Additionally, awarding to a different contractor at this point would result in increased risk to the VA due to the contractor being able to point to the initial system and server installation as the issue for any malfunctions that they might have.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  It is not a solicitation or request for offers.  No solicitation package is available.  A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  Responses must be received NLT 3:30 EST on 8/29/2017.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Amendment-000001

NOTE: Per issuance of this Solicitation Amendment, the hour and date specified for receipt of quotes IS NOT extended. Quotes submitted in response to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation P17PS02750 are due by 08/30/2017 at 1300 hours MDT. Contractor acknowledgement of this Amendment is required. 

1. The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the following information into Solicitation P17PS02750. 

a. Solicitation Related Questions Submitted by Contractors and Corresponding Answers: 

i. Question: "The Part Number you have listed (Model TC 460DD) here is for a Dealer Demo unit. I just want to confirm this is what you are asking for and not a new unit."

Answer: The Park Service is requesting a TriCaster 460. The product may either be a new model, or a dealer demo model, provided the unit has a full warranty and is in like new condition.
 
ii. Question: "Also the Gator Case is not the most durable case and we have a better alternative. Will you accept a substitute of equal or better quality?"

Answer: The storage case does not have to be a 'Gator Case' as previously outlined. The case must be a durable (e.g., 'hard') case, that provides secure storage and safe, effective transportation of the equipment for short distances. The Control Surface does not need to fit inside the case.

2. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
