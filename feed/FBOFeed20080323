<DESC>THIS  IS  NOT  A  REQUEST  FOR  PROPOSAL.  Business sources are currently being sought for a custom-built, interactive audio/visual system for the Naval Ophthalmic Support and Training Activity (NOSTRA) located at the Naval Weapons Station in Yorktown, Virginia. NOSTRA would like to have the capability to display pertinent information to its personnel throughout its 41,000 square foot building and seeks an interactive audio/visual system meeting the following specifications:    1.  Have the ability to display separate presentations on any given monitor or group of monitors.    2.  Support both DVD and PC-based presentations at the same time.      3.  Designed to receive real-time data from other sources such as networked servers and PCs.    4.  Have the capability for cable television.    5.  Be ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliant to accommodate NOSTRA?s hearing-impaired employees and include speech recognition based, real time         captioning capability.     6.  Be able to withstand a factory setting with airborne polish dust and other fine particles.    7.  Support multiple operating modes and the capability to move seamlessly from one operating mode to another.          a.  Unattended Operating Mode               (1)  The system should be designed so that information will be displayed in a manner such that once information is displayed, it will repeat the       information until a user or administrator makes changes to the presentation, at which point, the system will update and continue to operate in the                     unattended mode.                (2)  Multiple mounted plasma or LCD monitors of different sizes with ceiling-mounted speakers to reinforce the audio to the viewers shall be             located throughout the building, mounted with tilt capability to allow different viewing angles.                (3)  The system should be able to display presentations from DVD, PC (PowerPoint, video, slideshows, etc.) in a looping mode.                (4)  The system automation and management program should include automated startup, shutdown, and play listing.         b.  Presentation Operating Mode:              (1)  The system should be designed to allow for the audio/visual system to be used in an intimate presentation setting, where a speaker could present to a large group of personnel.  This operating mode will allow a presenter to access the information of a networked PC, laptop interface, or a dedicated VCR/DVD player.  Specifically this mode should have the capability for a    source select for the presentation and a destination select for the monitor or group of monitors.             (2)  Audio levels should be able to be increased, decreased, or muted.             (3)  The system automation and management program should include automated startup, shutdown, and play listing. Vendors able to provide and install such an interactive audio/visual system should send informational brochures and company name, address, POC, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, small business classification, and DUNS number/CAGE code to the following address:   Naval Ophthalmic Support and Training Activity, Attention Steven Hostetler, 160 Main Road, Suite 350, Naval Weapons Station, Yorktown, VA  23691.  Vendors who would like to make a presentation on their equipment or schedule a tour of NOSTRA?s facilites may make an appointment with Steven Hostetler by calling 757-887-7562 .  Please note that any presentations or tours will be at the vendor?s expense.
