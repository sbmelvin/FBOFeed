In addition, time constraints and extensive costs for the replacement of this software would jeopardize mission schedules. 3. Market research was conducted and it has been determined that this is a<br />sole source requirement. These reasons justify procuring the required services exclusively from 4DSP LLC.

The work identified is to be provided by means of a combination Firm-Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity type of contract.   Source Selection procedures will be used to select the proposal that provides the lowest price and is technically acceptable to the government. Offerors will be evaluated using the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Method.  In order to permit efficient competition, the Navy will utilize the following methodology:  Proposals will initially be screened for price and placed in order of price (lowest price to highest price).
  The Navy will then evaluate the technical factors of the three (3) lowest priced proposals.  The Navy will make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal from among the three (3) lowest priced proposals.  However, if no proposals are found to be technically acceptable within the first group of proposals, the Navy, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to increase the number of proposals it will review, until the Government identifies a technically acceptable proposal.  Accordingly, under this methodology, the technical factors of some proposals may not be evaluated by the Navy.  If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both technical and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range.
  Proposers are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms.

<DESC>The Buffalo District is currently preparing a solicitation to award a contract to enhance aquatic habitat within the Buffalo River and by extension habitat in Lake Erie.
<p>The Buffalo River drains a 447 square mile watershed, emptying into the eastern end of Lake Erie at the City of Buffalo. The banks of the lower Buffalo River are beset with urban/industrial use facilities that modified and hardened river banks. Aquatic habitat is limited throughout this part of the river. The urban/industrial use of the river has greatly declined over the years as the amount of heavy industry in the region has declined. Many adjacent urban/industrial use facilities were abandoned and are now being revitalized for new proposes. In many of these areas modified and hardened shorelines are no longer needed and are candidates for improvement and/or restoration under the USEPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) Program. Improvements to habitat in the lower Buffalo River are directly linked to restoration initiatives for Lake Erie.</p>
<p>The project site, Ellicott, is located within the city of Buffalo, in the Buffalo River located at river mile (RM) 1.2 (figure provided as attachment). The site is located on the right descending bank of the river and consists of the shallow water areas between the shorelines and the edge of the navigation channel.</p>
<p>Specific work to be performed will include removal a wood debris and bulkhead, the installation of in&#8208;water structure features such as locked logs and rootwads, and the planting of submerged and emergent vegetation.</p>
<p>Design for this project is modeled after the actions proposed by Buffalo Niagara River Keeper for the River Fest Park/BMGC and Blue Tower Turning Basin In&#8208;water and Shoreline Habitat Restoration Project.</p>
<p>This project is one of a number of projects seeking to reestablish habitat in the Lower Buffalo River. All projects in the vicinity will require monitoring after completion. Responsibility for monitoring is expected to fall under the jurisdiction of USEPA. Specific to this project, the contract requirements will include a one year warranty on plantings.</p>
<p>This project is funded through the USEPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) Program, and is being accomplished for USEPA under the authority of the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) by the USACE.<br /><br />Note: a response is not required at this time.</p>

In accordance with FAR 36.209   Construction Contracts with A-E Firms and 36.606 (c), all interested contractors are hereby put on notice that no construction contract may be awarded to the firm that ultimately designs this requirement.

Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f) and 52.215-1(c).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission.
Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.
To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as  unreadable  pursuant to FAR Part and FAR 15.207(c ). 
Password protecting your SF-330 is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated Government individuals.

The selection of the most qualified contractor will follow the guidance provided in FAR 36.6   Architect-Engineer Services.  Additionally, this solicitation is also issued in accordance with Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare Information and Technology Act of 2006, Sections 502 and 503, as a set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) contractors. Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to SDVOSB construction firms, as there is a reasonable expectation that two or more offers from SDVOSB contractors will be received under this solicitation. 

Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status and ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz.gov at the time SF-330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal/SF-330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The estimated magnitude for construction (not design) of this project is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.  

Contract Award Procedure: At time of award, the contractor must be certified by VetBiz and registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. Register via the SAM internet site at www.sam.gov. Failure of an SDVOSB to be VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE in VetBiz shall result in elimination from consideration as a potential contract awardee. Failure of a SDVOSB to be registered in SAM at the time of contract award shall result in elimination from consideration as a proposed contract awardee. The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. 
The review/design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work shall be accomplished by architects or engineers registered in a State or possession of the United States, or in Puerto Rico or in the District of Columbia.
The project drawings/design shall be in compliance with applicable standards and codes described in VA Program Guides and design materials. Master Construction Specifications Index, VA Construction Standards Index, VA Standards Index, and Criteria are available in the Technical Information Library (TIL) on VA Website address: http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/.

The awarded A-E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A-E to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541310 with a small business size of $7.5 million.

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systems Access and Security Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A/B MAC contractors access/use numerous CMS Medicare FFS systems to perform Medicare program functions. The contractor will not only access/read data in these CMS systems; the contractor will also (as specified by its SOW, the Medicare program manuals, and in CMS technical direction letters) create, revise, update, store, and archive Medicare program data, including Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) on Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare providers, primary and supplementary payers, and other entities.&nbsp; Some of the CMS systems that the JF, J8 and JH A/B MAC contractors will utilize (to access, create, revise, update, store and archive data) include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Federal Intermediary Standard System (FISS) system for processing Medicare claims from institutional providers (e.g., hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, etc.).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Medical Claims System (MCS) for processing Medicare claims from practitioners and suppliers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Common Working File system, for additional processing and authorization of all claim types.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Common Edit Module (CEM), which the A/B MAC will integrate into its electronic claims receipt capability.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Provider Enrollment Chain and Ownership System (PECOS) for processing Medicare provider enrollment applications, which also interfaces to numerous other systems in order to deliver its functionality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) to post and maintain Medicare accounts payable and receivable, and to support other fiscal and accounting functions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The System for Tracking Audit and Reimbursement (STAR) system, to manage and control Medicare provider audit and reimbursement workload.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Medicare Appeals System (MAS), to manage and control its claims appeals workload.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Integrated Data Repository, to support the A/B MAC's data analytics responsibilities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Contractor Reporting of Operational and Workload Data (CROWD) system, for reporting of A/B MAC claims and other workload data, and other CMS reporting systems.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CMS may create additional IT systems in the future to support the ongoing development of the Medicare FFS program, and the A/B MAC contractor may be required to develop processes and/or interfaces with such additional CMS systems to perform its duties (historically, these scenarios are one of many causes for SOW revisions&nbsp; post-award).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to serving as a user of numerous CMS systems, the A/B MAC contractor will itself provide additional IT systems and capabilities, particularly systems and capabilities to support its Medicare provider customer service program responsibilities, that will process and store PHI and PII.&nbsp; Generally, existing software will be modified or enhanced. These contractor-provided IT systems and capabilities (for instance, Medicare provider portals) must conform with CMS IT architecture and security requirements, and receive CMS approval before being put into production.&nbsp; Any Medicare data housed in contractor-furnished systems remain CMS program data. All MAC-provided IT is required to be compliant with Section 508.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Due to their enormous responsibilities as custodians of Medicare data, Medicare law (at Section 1874A(e) of the Act) specifically applies the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and related government-wide systems security requirements to the MACs.&nbsp; The Department and CMS have also applied many additional information security and critical infrastructure directives to the MACs, including Homeland Security Presidential Directive No. 12 (HSPD-12).</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">HQ/OIT/DITO aims to provide secure and reliable IT in innovative ways to improve health care delivery and quality, enhance access to care, reduce medical errors, and modernize administrative functions. The IHS OIT provides critical support for the IHS, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) health care facilities that care for more than two million American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people across the Indian Health system. The IHS provides the technology infrastructure for a nationwide health care system, including a secure wide area network, email and unified communication services, two national data centers, and regional and national Help Desk support for approximately 20,000 users.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">HQ/OIT/DITO, manages technology deployed for use across the agency, and touches the lives of everyone who interacts digitally with the IHS. From the emails sent and received to the web pages that provide information to the people users call for help, IT Operations brings IHS information technology services to IHS.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">HQ/OIT/DITO services include: </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&bull;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Network Operations - Led by the IHS Network Engineer, this group of federal and contract personnel manage the IHS Wide Area network connecting Federal, Tribal, and Urban facilities that utilize the IHS network. This group also manages the IHS use of the Network contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&bull;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) - Led by the ETS manager, this group maintains servers and services provided on an enterprise wide level. They also manage the OIT Data Center located in Albuquerque.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&bull;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Web Services - Led by the IHS Web Services Manager, this group develops and maintains the IHS web presence to the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&bull;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>National Service Desk - an enterprise service desk located in Albuquerque, NM which provides Tier 3 support for Federal, Tribal, and Urban facilities.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Additionally, IHS also operates semi-independent Services Desks at Regional Offices referred to as Areas whom support a unique physical region of the United States. It is important to note that these Regional Offices provide Tier 2 support to IHS Areas which are home to countless Hospitals, Health Care Centers, and Clinics and do not administratively and operational report to HQ/OIT/DITO.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">However, HQ/OIT/DITO is responsible for Tier 3 Infrastructure, Office Automation and Telecommunications (IOAT) support for the IHS enterprise via a tiered Service Desk to these Areas, defined as:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&bull;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tier 1 = Local site support at the Hospitals, Health Care Centers, and Clinics</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&bull;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tier 2 = Regional Areas provide support to their location and to the Hospitals, Health Care Centers, and Clinics assigned to their region</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&bull;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tier 3 = Within HQ/OIT/DITO located at headquarters offices provide support to the Regional Areas as well as their own local area network.</span></p>

<CONTACT>Stephanie Kelly, Phone 2024827876, Email stephanie.kelly@nist.gov
<DESC>Request for Information<br />Revolving Loan Fund Portfolio Management System<br />December 20, 2016<br />DESCRIPTION<br />1.1 The Department of Commerce (DOC), Economic Development Administration (EDA) is seeking information on how an interested respondee could provide an existing electronic application with proven functionality as a service for program oversight and risk management of grant recipients' loan portfolio summary information data in support of the Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) Program.<br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. <br />BACKGROUND<br />2.1 Mission <br />The Department of Commerce (DOC), Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides the U.S. with economic programs and grants to develop economic opportunities. The Economic Development Administration was established under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3121), as amended, to generate jobs, help retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas of the United States. EDA assistance is available to rural and urban areas of the Nation experiencing high unemployment, low income, or other severe economic distress. EDA is guided by the basic principle that distressed communities must be empowered to develop and implement their own economic development and revitalization strategies. Additional information about EDA and its programs can be found at www.eda.gov.<br />EDA plays a critical role in driving economic development in communities across the nation. Through the agency's diverse and flexible programs, EDA makes grants for a broad portfolio of construction, technical assistance, financing, and economic development planning that local and regional entities can use to support their communities' unique economic development goals. EDA works with communities nationwide through its six regional offices, located in Atlanta (GA), Austin (TX), Chicago (IL), Denver (CO), Philadelphia (PA), and Seattle (WA).<br />2.2 RLF Program<br />EDA's Economic Adjustment Assistance program provides grant funding to assists state and local interests in designing and implementing strategies to adjust or bring about change to an economy. Under Economic Adjustment, EDA administers its Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) Program, which supplies small businesses and entrepreneurs with the gap financing needed to start or expand their business. Throughout the United States, there are about 550 RLF Recipients with a combined portfolio of approximately $850 million.<br />In addition to the terms and conditions of the grant, RLF Recipients are required to create and update an RLF Plan that establishes its strategy, policies and operational procedures. The RLF Plan is submitted to EDA for its review and approval. The plan contains metrics for performance and risk assessment.<br />The RLF Program has five categories of program stakeholders, each of which have distinct user roles.<br />&bull; RLF Recipient - Grantee that manages RLF according to its EDA-approved RLF Plan.<br />&bull; RLF Administrator - EDA employees who administers a portfolio of RLFs in a regional office.<br />&bull; RLF Coordinator - EDA employee who coordinates policy and program information at EDA Headquarters.<br />&bull; EDA Regional Office - EDA employees in regional offices that also interact with RLF Recipients.<br />&bull; EDA Headquarters - EDA employees in Washington, D.C. that maintain policy, guidance, and regulations.<br />OBJECTIVES<br />3.1 The RLF Program is implementing new risk management regulations, policies, and procedures to support improved governance of the grant program and oversight of the RLF Recipients' management of their revolving loan portfolios. Because of the nature of the RLF program, EDA seeks to leverage established and proven industry tools and functionality for risk management and oversight of similar financial information for the target RLF System. The system will facilitate RLF reporting, audit review, risk scoring and oversight of compliance actions as well as enable RLF Recipients to update or prepare their RLF Plan. Through reporting, RLF Recipients will submit loan summary information for their loan portfolio.<br />(Note: The target system will not serve grant management functions, which will be managed through a separate electronic grants management system.)<br />3.2 EDA is seeking to obtain an existing application with proven functionality as a service for risk management and program oversight of grant and loan summary information data in support of the RLF Program. The service platform shall provide secure access for all RLF program stakeholders to participate in the RLF Program governance and oversight-leveraging those established tools for portfolio and risk management. A supplier-hosted service platform will reduce the burden on EDA to build and maintain infrastructure to support the RLF Program. Leveraging tools that have been designed for and used in industry to support grant and loan programs will provide best practices and lessons learned for that type of data and information and service operations.<br />3.3 The functionality and tools that EDA seeks to provide through this system should enable RLF Recipients to streamline and improve reporting on their loan programs, improve loan servicing processes, and improve the efficiency of managing their loan portfolios, while also easing program management functions for EDA staff and providing EDA staff with an effective tool for risk analysis and program monitoring and oversight. <br />REQUIREMENTS
<p>4.1 Brief Overview of System Requirements</p>

If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a quote as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, and if subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of the effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large business subcontractors will be used.

<DESC>Sources Sought Robotic Arm System
This Sources Sought is a request for information  only, and is not a solicitation for offers.
VA  Pittsburgh Healthcare System/HERL is seeking sources for a robotic arm (manipulator).  The requested   Brand Name  Kinova , JACO 6 DOF No Gripper Robotic Arm System and accessories,  or  Equal  will be used for collaborative research as a testing apparatus.  A JACO is a light-weight (5.2kg) manipulator composed of six inter-linked carbon fiber segments  and a three fingered hand.  It is typically mounted to the side of a powered wheelchair seat frame allowing it to follow the tilt movement of the seat.  The intended use is to identify a list of functional tasks and a set of commercial / custom adapters that allow a JACO arm to assist the completion of these tasks, investigate the validity of a validated assessment tool (ARMET), and determine the effectiveness of a JACO arm in real-world use and examine its potential benefits.  
Please respond via email to Cheryl.purpura@va.gov by 4:00pm, 12/20/2016 if you are an authorized distributor and source for a robotic arm with accessories  that can assist veterans who use powered mobility devices who experience functional limitations in reaching and handling that are basic activities of daily living.  Provide sufficient information in your response concerning the product and the contractor s capabilities.

<DESC>Emerging Technology Solutions to Identify, Locate and Mitigate the Impact of Jamming
<p>A. INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) is hosting the 2017 First Responder Electronic Jamming Exercise to assess the effectiveness of jamming mitigation technologies and techniques, tactics and procedures. The 2017 exercise will take place from July 17 - 22, 2017, at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls, Idaho. The 2017 exercise directly builds off of the findings of the 2016 First Responder Electronic Jamming Exercise, which validated the hypothesis that commercially available illegal jammers can impede public safety communications and first responders' ability to successfully complete their mission.</p>
<p>DHS S&amp;T is seeking to evaluate technology solutions that identify, locate and mitigate the impact of jamming of communications and position, navigation and timing systems used by law enforcement and public safety organizations (i.e., GPS, land mobile radio systems [VHF, UHF, 700/800 MHz] and commercial wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi or cellular systems). These technology solutions should make existing public safety communications systems more resilient in the presence of jammers and spectral interference. DHS S&amp;T invites industry, academia, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers and other Government organizations to submit applications addressing innovative technology solutions for testing and evaluation during the 2017 First Responder Electronic Jamming Exercise.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information for Participation (RFI) only and the Government will not award a contract on the basis of this RFI. Respondents who are selected will be asked to enter into a Limited Purpose Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (LP-CRADA) with DHS S&amp;T in order to participate in the 2017 exercise. Responses should be focused on jamming identification, localization and/or mitigation, and solutions must be Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or above. Organizations that respond will not be paid for the information submitted and the Government will not pay for any submission preparation or related costs.</p>
<p>Documents submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. The Government is under no obligation to provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government invitation to participate in the 2017 First Responder Electronic Jamming Exercise. The Government may or may not use any responses to this RFI as a basis for a subsequent project.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>During the 2017 exercise, DHS S&amp;T will test and evaluate the selected technology solutions in a live-jamming environment with active public safety communications systems. DHS S&amp;T is looking to assess the current state of jamming identification, localization and mitigation technologies and determine if solutions are viable in a variety of jamming conditions, or if additional research and development is needed. Industry participants will not only have the opportunity to validate their technology solutions in a rare open-air jamming test environment - which is illegal in the United States except under controlled and authorized conditions such as this exercise - but will also test compatibility with first responder equipment and gather feedback directly from the first responder community. Law enforcement and public safety organizations are seeking solutions to jamming threats, and this exercise will allow industry to better determine possible solutions.</p>
<p>The 2017 First Responder Electronic Jamming Exercise will also provide federal, state and local law enforcement and public safety organizations with exposure to jamming environments, allowing them to better understand the threats they face from illegal jamming. Participating responders will help test both the technology solutions and the techniques, tactics and procedures that will enable them to identify, locate and mitigate the impact of jammers. Responder participants will also bring representative communications systems to help create the test environment (i.e., LTE deployable networks and cellular systems, land mobile radio systems [HF, VHF, UHF, 700/800 MHz; P25 conventional and trunking], GPS systems, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi systems, etc.). During the exercise, technology solutions capable of counteracting illegal jamming will be linked to active public-safety communications systems provided by state and local first responders to be tested under a variety of live-jamming conditions.</p>
<p>As an outcome of this exercise, DHS S&amp;T will provide clear recommendations to federal, state and local law enforcement and public safety organizations on technologies and tactics, techniques and procedures to identify, locate, and mitigate the impact of jammers. As organizations across the Homeland Security Enterprise become more aware of jamming threats, they become more prepared to recognize, respond, report, and resolve jamming incidents, which makes the nation more resilient.</p>
<p>After review of the technology solution applications, the Government may invite candidates to test and evaluate their technologies during the 2017 First Responder Electronic Jamming Exercise. As stated above, participating organizations will be required to enter into an LP-CRADA that defines the conditions of participation, including intellectual property rights and security parameters for sharing information. DHS S&amp;T will provide the test environment and each selected participant will use it and share data in return. Industry participation in the 2017 exercise does not suggest or imply that the Government will endorse, procure, or purchase equipment.</p>

<DESC>Introduction

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for market research and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  

The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.

Background

The VA is the second largest Federal agency in the United States (US) and delivers health care, benefits, and services to the nation's Veterans. As one of three administrations within VA, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest US integrated health care system consisting of 153 hospitals, nearly 1,400 community-based outpatient clinics, community living centers, Vet Centers and Domiciliary rehabilitation centers. 

As an organization, VA has made a strong commitment to advancing the quality of care as well as improving the Veteran experience.  In support of VHA's number one strategic goal, "to provide personalized, proactive, patient driven healthcare," a number of facilities have adopted an innovative approach to delivery of care within inpatient units using Interactive Patient Care Systems (IPCS).  This approach is based on the premise that the more engaged, empowered, and stimulated Veterans are in their own healthcare, the better their experience and outcomes. 

The Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT) in support of its core strategy to improve the patient experience, meet VHA goals, and "hardwire" cultural change, began supporting the planning and implementation of inpatient bedside IPCS technology at the Birmingham VA Medical Center (VAMC) in fiscal year 2011. Subsequently, approximately 32 VA facilities that have either deployed or are in the process of deploying IPCS products within the VHA's electronic health care record, which is a system of systems that has 100+ medical and business applications, e.g., laboratory, nutrition, surgery, accounting, purchasing.  The system is entitled Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA), http://www.ehealth.va.gov/VistA_Monograph.aspIt.  




Requirements 

The VA requires virtualized IPCS solutions to improve the Veteran's experience, meet VHA goals, and "hardwire" cultural change that provides a product that can engage, empower and educate Veterans. This includes the following:

a)	Places Veterans at the center of their care with tools that proactively engage them and their families. 
b)	Provides ready access to education and targeted skill-building resources to better manage patients' health.
c)	Fosters continuing communication and intervention between patients and staff.
d)	Personalizes the health management experience according to Veteran preferences, needs and goals.
e)	Enhances the healthcare team experience with resources and tools that: 
i.	Improves Veteran's access to care; 
ii.	Enhances health care delivery and provider-to-Veteran coordination; 
iii.	Ensures continuity of care to provide advanced healthcare outcomes for Veterans.
f)	Collects Veteran feedback on health status, satisfaction with experience, and perceptions of quality.
g)	Promotes linkage with My HealtheVet (MHV) and other Connected Health tools (mobile applications both provider and Veteran facing).
h)	Promotes broadcast opportunities with IP Cameras (such as those used in IP video security) that can be used in various locations. (e.g., chapel and/or auditorium - the service can be broadcast as "virtual channel" while simultaneously recording for later access via the patient interface).

The IPCS products offered shall be considered medical devices suitable for a medical environment, e.g., electrical/shock safety standards and clean ability (special coatings that contain antibacterial coating and may be easily cleanable and disinfected), tablets, servers, hardware and peripherals, to include mounting hardware and touch screen monitors, networking appliances , software, cable, etc.  VA may purchase a single feature such as basic entertainment (live television, on-demand movies, and relaxation), patient education specific to the Veteran's diagnosis or education need, or complete VistA interfaced IPCS solutions.  All features and technical functionality shall be available for purchase by any VA facility or a combination of VA facilities.  No leasing is contemplated.  As VHA's patient centered care program continues to evolve, changes and/or updates to the IPCS products offered may be necessary to ensure compliance with VA's Enterprise Architecture approved initiatives.  These changes and updates will be incorporated into the IPCS National Contract through Technology Refresh and/or Technology Insertion.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information (RFI)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LTE Technologies for Tactical Environments</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) requests submissions that address leveraging the increased data capacity available in 4G LTE-Advanced or 4G LTE-Advanced Pro communications architectures to improving tactical command, control and communications capability at the maneuver Brigade level and below.</p>
<p><strong>2. Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to solicit information and suggestions from industry, including network service providers, operators, infrastructure providers, equipment manufacturers, system integrators, consultants, and others, pertaining to a viable LTE in Tactical Environments (LiTE) solution.</p>
<p><strong>3. Key Action Dates</strong></p>
<p>Submissions shall be received within 60 calendar days of RFI release, no later than 1159am on 20 February 2017.</p>
<p><strong>4. Requirements</strong></p>
<p>4.1 Submissions may address all or part of these requirements as described in the "Scope of Responses" section.</p>
<p>4.2 Submissions shall be compatible with commercial smartphone technology for data display and user application processing. Any modification required to User Equipment (UE) should be addressed.</p>
<p>4.3 Submissions shall address augmenting the military's radios' over-the-air link with effective, tactically-relevant LTE capabilities that are suitable for use at Company and below in the context of maneuver Brigades and multiple divisions.</p>
<p>4.4 Submissions shall subscribe to the following tenets of LTE deployment into Tactical Environments:</p>
<p>- Leverage the LTE ecosystem and economies of scale to deliver affordable solutions</p>
<p>- Leverage LTE investments in highly integrated chipsets to deliver best performance</p>
<p>- Translate the LTE "user experience" to military tactical environment (i.e. continuity of service across the battlespace, ease of network entry, etc.)</p>
<p>- Use modular architecture to allow rapid technology insertion (i.e. allow for new antennas, new chipsets, new User Equipment (UE), etc.)</p>
<p>- No modification to UE internal and external interfaces to preserve economies of scale and prevent point solutions</p>
<p>- Push the computational burden to the eNodeB instead of UE whenever possible to manage system size, weight, and power (SWaP)</p>
<p>4.5 Submissions shall address electromagnetic hardening of commercial technology to support military operations in contested environment against near-peer adversaries that have the capability to disrupt access to the communication channels. The objective of this request is to seek submissions of technology that harden the eNodeB and the smartphone/UE to maintain overall performance in the presence of multiple active jammers.</p>
<p>4.6 Submissions shall address the technology used to harden the UE. Preference is given to solutions that have a clean hardware abstraction layer to allow for rapid technology insertion, including upgrading the UE to subsequent generation smart phones and/or upgrading the hardening solution without disturbing the UE. Submissions need to clearly define the system level approach and assumptions or constraints on the eNodeB, UE, and supporting elements needed to accomplish the above objective.</p>
<p>4.7 Submissions shall address anti-jamming capabilities at the eNodeB. Effective anti-jamming may be accomplished via an appliqu&eacute; (external hardware and software) or via standard-compliant mechanisms such as beamforming, or through a combination of the two. As above, submissions need to clearly define the system level approach and assumptions or constraints on the eNodeB, UE, and supporting elements needed to accomplish the above objective. If standard-compliant mechanisms (e.g., "custom beamforming") mechanisms are submitted, the submitter must document specific performance claims (including range, data rate, J/S performance, number of UEs supported, etc.). Interfaces for software and hardware integration with other components must be clearly defined and shall conform to existing standards where possible.</p>
<p>4.8 Submissions shall specify the minimum LTE Release required, bands supported, the spectrum requirements, and the details of any anti-jamming frequency hopping among bands. Solutions may operate across multiple LTE bands and may use LTE Carrier Aggregation as a means to avoid jamming. Any requirements, assumptions, or constraints on eNodeBs and UEs must be clearly identified.<br /><br />4.9 Submissions shall include information regarding the number of simultaneously active users (see below), the ability to maintain uninterrupted voice calls when transiting from one area of the battlespace to another, and ability to retain the same IP address and security associations when moving throughout the battlespace.</p>
<p>4.10 Submissions shall address how on-the-move eNodeBs manage support of UEs and any use of Self Organizing Network (SON) capabilities to detect and avoid hostile interference. Solutions may use LTE-standard support capabilities, such as SON to support the interactions among UEs and eNodeBs and among eNodeBs.</p>
<p>4.11 Submissions shall address how unintended interference with adjacent eNodeBs while on the move in varying terrain is mitigated. Solutions must account for the fact that eNodeBs will, primarily, be mounted on vehicles and will be operating on the move, at times in the proximity of other vehicles carrying eNodeBs. Solutions that allow vehicular antennas that do not require stowage while on the move are preferred.</p>
<p>4.12 Submissions shall address how EnodeBs will operate in the presence of other friendly-force communications, radar, and electronic warfare equipment. Solutions shall identify the means whereby operational flexibility is maintained while spectrum is dynamically sensed, coordinated, and deconflicted, with minimal requirement for operator interaction. The coordination mechanism may be external to the LRW communication systems; solutions should be prepared to interface with external sources of C2.</p>
<p>4.13 Submissions shall address whether and how portions of the LTE network may be partitioned from other portions. If any eNodeB or subset of eNodeBs is partitioned from other eNodeBs and the rest of the tactical network, calls and connections from UEs must continue to be accepted and serviced. Traffic must continue to be routed according to network policies. This may require the distribution of essential Enhanced Packet Core (EPC) capabilities and caching of key database content among eNodeB systems. Calls and connections that are capable of continuing when the network becomes partitioned (such as a connection between two UEs served by the same eNodeB, or a connection between UEs connected to eNodeBs that have mutual connectivity but are no longer connected to the rest of the network) must continue without interruption when the rest of the network becomes partitioned, and must continue when the partition is "healed." Submissions shall provide details of the provisioning mechanisms required to enable UEs to access the network, as well as mechanisms for revoking access to potentially lost UEs across the distributed network.</p>
<p>4.14 Submissions shall address the possibility, particularly at lower echelons, that Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) resources may not be available for backhaul. Accordingly, SCO is interested in solutions that provide backhaul via "in-band" methods such as described in (Favraud &amp; Nikaein, 2015).</p>
<p>4.15 Submissions shall address whether the use of LTE Proximity Services (ProSe) to provide device-to-device service to military users that are otherwise isolated from the LTE network due to distance or interference is used with an explanation of why or why not, and the specific LTE release on which these capabilities depend.</p>
<p><strong>5. Scope of Responses</strong></p>
<p>5.1 The information obtained may be used to finalize requirements for the LiTE project and determine if viable products exist. Your thoughtful responses and your time to assist SCO by responding to this RFI is appreciated.</p>
<p>5.2 Providers shall include a cover page that identifies: company name, company mailing address, point of contact information (e-mail and phone numbers).</p>
<p>5.3 Submitters may offer technology for any of the following: the UE, the eNodeB, the Self-Organizing Network capability, the Enhanced Packet Core, wireless mesh backhauling, or other system support elements. For all of these possibilities, submissions shall clearly define the system level approach and assumptions or constraints on each of the system elements in order to accomplish the above objectives.</p>
<p>5.4 <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All submissions shall be limited to a maximum of twenty (20) pages. Respondents shall submit one (1) electronic version (PDF) by the date listed in the Key Action Dates and must be submitted via e-mail to SCO.RFI@sco.mil. Responses should be unclassified, or at most secret collateral. Classified submissions must be coordinated with SCO Security (SCO.Security@sco.mil) prior to submission.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>6. System Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Solutions shall identify the applicable capabilities in the table, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">which is provided in Section 6 of the attachment to this&nbsp;RFI (titled "SCO RFI_LTE - with table"), and complete the system requirements matrix for those applicable capabilities (please complete separate entries for vehicular-mounted, UAS-mounted, and dismounted/manpack systems). Assume 24- and 72-hour mission times, always-on, 80% receive and 20% transmit for UEs. Indicate intended power source in "Power Consumption" cell as well as wattage requirements.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Key system characteristics</strong></p>
<p>Submitters shall define the key characteristics of their proposed solutions in sufficient detail that SCO can determine both the efficacy of the proposed solution, but also the potential interactions with other proposed solutions. Care should be taken to provide as thorough a description of the capabilities as possible. The lists of key system characteristics and system requirements are not exhaustive, and submitters shall expand upon these lists as appropriate.</p>
<p>- Protection against different types of jammers (submitter must specify the types of jammers for which protection is provided)</p>
<p>- J/S performance for 1 jammers (submitter must specify the types of jammers and test conditions)</p>
<p>- J/S performance for N jammers (N&gt;1, submitter must specify the maximum value of N supported by the proposed solution): free space, rural, and dense-urban propagation environments.</p>
<p>- Operating range in presence of N jammers (free space, rural, dense-urban environments)</p>
<p>- Effective Data rate / Packet-Error-Rate in presence of N jammers (free space, rural, dense-urban environments)</p>
<p>- Frequency diversity (ability to operable across wideband): LTE (and possibly non-LTE) bands supported, and maximum and minimum total and instantaneous bandwidth.</p>
<p>- Frequency hopping (ability to periodically change operational frequency bands): Frequency bands supported, hopping rates, channels affected, etc.</p>
<p>- Network Size: Number of UEs and eNodeBs simultaneously supported, plus any constraints on numbers of UEs per eNodeB, topological and interconnectivity requirements, etc. Note: Minimum 2500 UEs and 200 eNodeBs.</p>
<p>- External requirements, such as a reliance on GPS for timing and/or positioning information of eNodeBs.</p>

The TRB of the National Academies has been promoting and coordinating a new annual TRB Minority Student Fellows Pilot Program.  The  program has helped to support the travel, lodging, and subsistence expenses for minority students from a selected group of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) and other minority-serving institutions to attend the TRB Annual Meeting and to present a student-authored research paper at a session at the meeting., Each of the eligible institutions participating in the program is invited to select one student from an underrepresented minority group from among its graduate students or advanced undergraduates in a transportation-related curriculum to participate in the program, and also to designate a faculty member to oversee the work of the student and to accompany the student to the TRB Annual Meeting.  <br />Under the program, stipends are provided to both the student and their faculty sponsor in the amount of $2,000 to $2,500, depending on the distance of their location from Washington, DC, where the TRB Annual Meeting is held; the total cost for a donor organization to sponsor one Fellow and their faculty sponsor is $5,000 annually.  At inception of the pilot, TRB funded 4 students under this program from their own pockets.  The FHWA is the first Federal agency to serve as a donor organization and has sponsored a student from 2013 to the present.  FHWA wishes to continue to participate and help this program be successful.

<RESPDATE>122216
<CONTACT>Julie Ann Wyandt, Phone 3042563285, Email wyandt.julie@dol.gov
<DESC>The Department of Labor, Mine Safety &amp; Health Administration, intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of U.S.C.253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1) - Soliciting from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, to Quality Systems International, 545 Island Road, Suite 2-C, Ramsey, NJ 07446 for maintenance of the Mine Safety and Health Administrations' Technical Support WINLIMS system.
<p>The Pittsburgh Safety and Health Technology Center and National Air and Dust Laboratory (NADL) are responsible for the analysis and reporting of Coal and Metal/Nonmetal enforcement samples. The results of these samples have a critical impact on the health and safety of miners. These results are used to issue citations and prioritize future sampling inspections.<br />In order to provide timely results, Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) must be operational at all times. This system is a custom database used to track all samples from their receipt at the lab through the analysis process and reporting of data.  It is used to index and archive all information and data associated with sample analyses, and is the source of electronic files which are uploaded into MSHA's health database in Denver and for the data that is formatted into reports for samples collected at individual mines.  Both the Pittsburgh and NADL laboratories use this system under a multiple site licensing agreement.</p>
<p>Both laboratories are accredited based on ISO 17025 international standards.   As part of this accreditation, the laboratory must record receipt of all samples, give the sample a unique identification, and document the custody of samples from collection through transportation, receipt, preservation, storage, analysis, retention and reporting of data. These mandatory activities are accomplished through use of the QSI WINLIMS system.</p>
<p>QSI will maintain a multi-site Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) in good working order. Technical Support laboratories will be licensed to utilize this for calendar years 2017-2019. Support will include telephone, remote and internet support along with "bug" fixes and software upgrades as they become available. This covers both core license and customer (user) licenses.</p>
<p>Quality Systems International Corporation (QSI) is the manufacturer of the LIMS system used by MSHA Technical Support. The software is customized by QSI. The program software was designed to meet the specifications of MSHA. LIMS interacts with many other laboratory programs and instruments to provide data to enforcement personnel. It was designed to calculate industrial hygiene samples, assign appropriate MSHA contaminant codes and transmit data files to the MSIS system. The programs are written in code and therefore unable to be changed except by QSI programmers.</p>
<p>This action will result in a firm fixed price contract for a base year plus two optional year periods.  The period of performance will commence on or about January 1, 2017 for a base year of a twelve (12) month period and then two optional year periods with a ending date on or about December 31, 2019.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541512 with a size standard of $27.5 million.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals.  There is no solicitation document.  No RFP will be available for competitive proposals.  Phone calls will not be accepted.  The point of contact for this action is Purchasing Agent Julie Wyandt, who can be reached at Wyandt.julie@dol.gov .  Please reference "Special Notice 17-MSHA-OTS-NAT-0027" in the subject line of any e-mails.  Interested parties may express their interest and provide a capabilities statement NLT Thursday, December 22, 2016 at 2:00 p.m. EST.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.<br /><br />This is a notification that the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to extend contract services currently performed by CSRA, LLC 3170 Fairview Park Dr., Falls Church, VA 22042-4516 under a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract HQ0147-16-0045. The contract was previously awarded on a sole source basis under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency Requirements. MDA intends to execute a contract modification to create two (2), three-month options to provide uninterrupted, high-quality continuity of operations in facilities and infrastructure sustainment. The current option period expires on February 22, 2017. The additional options will extend services through August 22, 2017. The basis of the intended contract modification is statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency Requirements.
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541614 with a size standard of $15M for subcontracting opportunities. <br />This notice is not a request for proposals.

<p>&bull; Assess the current marketplace and existing industry capabilities to fulfill all or portions of the GMD scope of work;<br />&bull; Obtain recommendations from industry on the contract duration/period of performance, acquisition strategies and approaches (including contract and incentive structures) that are available to support the GMD scope of work;<br />&bull; Identify and assess the major risks to the acquisition; <br />&bull; Identify and mitigate any potential barriers to competition;<br />&bull; Determine industry data/information needs to support proposal preparations; and<br />&bull; Identify areas that could be set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>This is a market research announcement for informational planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by MDA. Information submitted will be considered as an exchange of capabilities and may be used as part of future RFP(s), either as a single contract activity or under multiple contract actions. MDA will not accept any responses submitted as classified information. Any proprietary information provided should be properly marked. No RFP/solicitation will be issued at this time. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no costs incurred or obligations made on behalf of MDA. MDA is in no way bound by the information obtained through this RFI should an RFP/solicitation be issued at a later date. Responses to this notice will not be construed as an offer and will not be accepted by MDA to form a binding contract.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Modification for TFDM Software Operations and Sustainment
<SOLNBR>HM0476-15-C-0009
<RESPDATE>010417
<CONTACT>Bradley R. Austin, Contract Specialist, Phone 5715579854, Email bradley.r.austin@nga.mil
<DESC>1.	Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to issue a sole source modification to existing contract HM0476-15-C-0009 with Freedom Consulting Group, 9881 Broken Land Parkway, Suite 300, Columbia, MD, 21046-1157, to continue operations and sustainment for the Topographic Feature Data Management (TFDM) software baseline, continued development to incorporate automated workflows that facilitate the ingestion of large quantities of topographic data, maintenance of the topographic data model, and improvements to the web-based data export application. The period of performance for the existing contract will be extended for 12 months to March 13, 2018.
<p>2.	The sole source modification to the existing contract will provide operation and sustainment for the TFDM software baseline under terms consistent with the current requirements of the contract. All maintenance (preventive and scheduled), performance monitoring and issue resolution, discrepancy report (DR) work-off efforts, help desk support, and usage analysis are included in this effort. Transition planning and decommissioning will be included in this extension to facilitate a smooth transition to a longer-term development and sustainment contract following this extension period.</p>
<p>3.	Freedom Consulting Group is the only vendor who can provide the required level of support necessary to avoid operational impacts to the vast user community. Freedom Consulting's familiarity with the TFDM software baseline, architecture, operations, user community, and roadmap make them the most risk averse and cost effective solution for this extension period. Any change in developer prior to award of a follow-on contract would delay the delivery of the remaining TFDM capabilities. Furthermore, a change in developer would create a disruption that would unnecessarily introduce additional risk to our customer base and degrade their operational effectiveness.</p>
<p>4.	This notice of intent is being published in accordance with FAR 5.2 requiring the dissemination of information on proposed contract actions. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source modification to an existing contract. The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. There is a reasonable basis to conclude that the highly specialized supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Further, award of this requirement to a different source would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirements and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>5.	This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability in response to the requirement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>6.	The Government will issue a Justification and Approval to support the need for a sole source award.</p>

<RESPDATE>010417
<CONTACT>Edward Jimenez, Email esjimen@sandia.gov
<DESC><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background Information:<br /><br /></strong></span>Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) is a leading Federally Funded Research &amp; Development Center and scientific innovator that aims to provide exceptional service in the national interest. With more than 70 years of research and development expertise, SNL's scientists are viewed as experts in their respective fields. As one of the nation's premiere scientific laboratories, SNL's research and development teams are equipped with state of the art research tools, equipment, and test facilities. As part of the technology transfer mission at SNL, collaboration with industry is encouraged and supported by the Department of Energy.<br /><br />SNL has made an initial investment in the research and development of an energy efficient irregular computed tomography (CT) reconstruction algorithm for large-scale datasets using multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). This technology is described in part in various scientific publications for industrial applications such as high-resolution Nano-CT as well as wide field-of-view component inspection. SNL is seeking commercial partners who are interested in investing in the further development of this technology to create a product that could be deployed by the industrial and medical communities. SNL is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Opportunity Description: <br /><br /></strong></span>SNL is seeking a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with an industrial partner that has proven experience in the design, development, and deployment of non-destructive evaluation software. The objective of this collaboration would be the joint development of a GUI-based CT reconstruction program capable of reconstructing up to 4 trillion volumetric pixels in less than 24 hours. Collaborators will work with SNL on the continued development and testing of the CT reconstruction program and will provide a clear path to commercialization/deployment of the technology through refined product design, optimization, and quality assurance.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Little Rock District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:
<p>Design-Build, to the Keller Army Community Hospital Renewal, Phase II at West Point, NY</p>
<p>This project is to repair the failing infrastructure that is in critical condition and could impact the life, health and safety of the patients, staff, and visitors to Keller Army Community Hospital, West Point, NY. The building's Heating, Ventilations and Air-Conditioning must maintain proper air flow conditions that meet infection control air exchange rates and indoor air quality standards. This design build project is to implement Phase 2 Renewal to modernize the remaining spaces in Bldg. 900, primarily the second, third and fourth floors to include a working Dining Facility (DFAC). The Design Build contractor is to design and renovate the four (4) designated areas, identified as the second, third, and fourth floors to include the DFAC for Building 900, that is when combined an approximately 66,000 SF for the Phase 2. Continuation of operations for all services is critical during the implementation of Phase 2 modernization. The DB Contractor is responsible and must identify how to mitigate any and all disruptions in a working medical facility to include ensuring the operating room suite remains open with complete functionality during Phase II construction.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: $25M-100M</p>
<p>Category of Construction Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, North American Industry Classification System code for this procurement is 236220, which has a small business size standard of $36.5 Million.</p>
<p>The Standard Industrial Code is 1542-General Contractors-Nonresidential Buildings, Other than Industrial Buildings and Warehouses.</p>
<p>The PSC is Z2DA-Repair or Alteration of Hospitals and Infirmaries</p>
<p>Estimated duration, deadline and complexity: 1,200 calendar days, Award NLT Dec 2017 and med range complexity.</p>
<p>Trades expected to be employed on this project: The expected trades for this project include but are not limited to, architectural, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, fire protection, windows, and roofing.</p>
<p>Some of the areas that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br />b. The complexity of the project. <br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area. <br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above areas, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the USACE Little Rock District are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>Q1.) Do you have knowledge that a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? *If so, please provide supporting documentation.</p>
<p>Q2.) Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? *If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>Q3.) Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the reference project should be completed? *If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>Q4.) Indentify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>Q5.) Indentify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>Q6.) Please indentify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>Q7.) Please indentify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the reference project.</p>
<p>Additional Questions of interest that may be answered if applicable:<br />1. What market share does union labor have in the geographic area for this project or type of construction?</p>
<p>2. Does the local market contain the sufficient number of available skilled workers for this project? <br />o Are the other projects in the vicinity going to limit the pool of skill labor available for your project?</p>
<p>3. What investments have been made to support registered apprenticeship programs?</p>
<p>4. Have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by the public or private sector in this geographic region?</p>
<p>5. Have PLAs been used on this type of project in other regions?</p>
<p>6. Which CBAs are likely to expire during the course of the project under consideration that might cause delays? (local building trades and contractors can provide information)</p>
<p>7. How do open shop and union wage rates influence prevailing wage rates in the local market and compare to Davis Bacon rates?<br />o What impact does unionization in the local market have on wages?</p>
<p>8. Could a PLA contribute to cost savings in any of the following ways?<br />o Harmonization of shifts and holidays between the trades to cut labor costs?<br />o Minimizing disruptions that may arise due expiration of CBA?<br />o Availability of trained, registered apprentices, efficient for highly skilled workforce?<br />o Allowing for changes in apprentice to journeyman ratio.<br />o Serving as a management tool that ensures highly skilled workers from multiple trades are coordinated in the most efficient way?<br />o Other?</p>
<p>9. Could a PLA minimize risk and contribute to greater efficiency in any of the following ways?<br />o Mechanisms to avoid delays<br />o Complying with Davis Bacon and other labor standards, safety rules and EEO and OFCCP laws.<br />o Ensuring a steady supply of skilled labor in markets with low supply or high competition for workers.</p>
<p>10. Are there ways in which a PLA might increase costs on this particular project?</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitations announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>

<p>CLIN 0001: Design Study for Disc Holder for PHI 660</p>
<p>(vi) Description of requirements:</p>
<p>The Government requires a preliminary design study for a custom sample insertion chamber, transfer mechanism and measurement stage for the PHI 660 Auger Microscope (PHI 660 shown in Fig.2). The contractor shall provide the preliminary design study with sufficient detail to determine cost and delivery time for the custom sample system.</p>
<p>The custom sample insertion chamber, transfer mechanism and measurement stage for the PHI 660 Auger Microscope shall meet the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>The following requirements apply to three (3) types of specimens:</p>
<p>1) Cylindrical specimen (disc) with range of diameters 101.5 to 109 mm, 12.7 mm high and 950 g mass (shown in Fig. 1)</p>
<p>2) Spherical specimen (ball) with 20-22 mm diameter.</p>
<p>3) Standard PHI 660 specimen holders<br />Insertion chamber (load lock):<br />&bull; The insertion chamber shall attach to the main chamber of the PHI 660 via a standard 8" (outer diameter) CF flange.<br />&bull; The insertion chamber shall allow for the loading of all three (3) types of above mentioned specimens.<br />&bull; The chamber shall be separable from the main chamber by a gate valve withhold ultra-high vacuum (UHV) vs atmospheric pressure<br />&bull; The insertion chamber shall allow pumping to a pressure of &lt;5x10-7 Torr using an existing roughing and turbopump (Pfeiffer/Balzers TPU050) or by provided pumps.</p>
<p>Transfer mechanism:<br />&bull; A transfer mechanism shall be provided for transporting the sample from the insertion chamber at a pressure of &lt;5x10-7 to the measurement chamber (normally under UHV).</p>
<p>Measurement stage:<br />&bull; Disc area for measurement access: 16mm x16mm area whose center is 42mm from the center of the sample stage (red box in Figure 1). Only an instrument-defined spot must be measured within this area at any measurement instance.<br />&bull; Ball measurement area: position on ball surface<br />&bull; The measurement stage shall allow for the translation of the disc samples such that the disc measurement, ball surface, or PHI 660 specimen holder can be centered under the electron and ion beams. <br />&bull; The stage shall allow fine translation across measurement area to a precision of &lt;20 &micro;m. <br />&bull; The stage shall be able to tilt the specimen measurement surface to 10-15 degrees from horizontal towards the ion gun. <br />&bull; The measurement stage shall not have a vibration displacement above 1 &micro;m. Entire UHV chamber rides on an air table.<br />&bull; A Perkin-Elmer/PHI 15-630 Precision Sample Stage currently resides in the PHI 660 Instrument. The new stage shall be compatible with the Perkin-Elmer/PHI 15-630 Precision Sample Stage.

The PHI 15-630 has a gear at mid PHI 660 holder height about 2 cm away from holder edge, and more mechanism at about 3 cm away that rapidly rises above standard sample holder height.</p>
<p>General requirements:<br />&bull; If the gate valve does not close during measurement due to the new sample transfer/measurement stage(s), the insertion chamber pumping system shall have an emergency shutoff to isolate the insertion and measurement chamber from the mechanical pumps.<br />&bull; The sample and holder shall not impact the microbeam ion gun (PHI 06-650, shown in Figs. 3-4) during insertion, transfer or positioning for measurement. Ion gun is roughly 2-3 cm from current sample holder, lower edge about at level of two screws on right side of current sample holder in Fig. 4.<br />&bull; Access to the PHI 660 at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD shall be provided after contract award, but not during solicitation, as this is a commercially available instrument present in numerous labs across the country that has been in the market since at least 1974.<br />&bull; Adequate (not comprehensive) detail shall be provided to demonstrate feasibility of conforming to the space and movement requirements above.</p>
<p>The preliminary design study shall be provided by the Contractor to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) by email or postal service within ninety (90) days after date of contract (ADC).</p>
<p>FIGURES 1 THROUGH 7 WILL BE ATTACHED IN SEPARATE DOUMENT.</p>

Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es):  http://www.acquisition.gov/far, http://www.doi.gov/pam, http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/2010-7967.htm <BR> <BR>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- (A) Are [  ] are not [  ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [  ] have not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are [  ] are not [  ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and Cont... <BR> <BR>(D) Have [  ], have not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [  ] has not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. Cont... <BR> <BR>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights? (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. (b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract. (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties. (d) Disputes. This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes. Failure of the parties to this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. (f) Excusable delays.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. (u) Unauthorized Obligations (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor?s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.

The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? <BR> <BR>(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to? (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.

(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor? (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor?s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule.

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation.

In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor?s records.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF)/National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) conducts research and publishes high quality reports on the scope, quality, and vitality of the U.S. and international science and engineering enterprise. One area of importance is venture capital and private equity investment that is critical for commercializing nascent and emerging technologies that originate from scientific research. <br /><br />NCSES requires comprehensive and accurate data and information on global venture capital and private equity financing, including by country, financing stage, and technology area. NCSES is particularly interested in global patterns of venture and private equity finance by country, technology, and financing stage; the patterns and trends of early stage venture capital financing; and developing indicators of venture capital and or private equity investor interest in technology areas. <br /><br />NCSES is a U.S. statistical agency and has rigorous standards for data quality and accuracy. Therefore, the vendor shall include documentation in its technical proposal that addresses the quality, coverage, and accuracy of its data.<br /><br />Data coverage, time period, and other characteristics:<br />--Global venture capital data by calendar year from the mid-1990s to 2015 or the most recent year;<br />--Global venture capital and private equity by amount invested in countries based on the location of the portfolio company taking the investment; <br />--Global venture capital financing and private equity by stage of financing; <br />--Global venture and private equity capital by technology area. The vendor shall have a comprehensive classification that has broad and sub-fields of technologies. <br /><br />The vendor shall include a description of its classification system and how it was developed;  <br /> --Data on venture and/or private equity-backed firms that have ties and/or a relationship to the academic sector, such as the university attended by founders and/or key personnel of firms and/or firms that originated as start-ups from universities;<br />--It is desirable that the vendor has data or indicators on investor interest in technology areas, such as the pre-money valuation of companies prior to an investment or financing. The vendor shall provide a description of its data that could be used as an indicator of investor interest in technologies; and,<br />--It is desirable that the vendor has data on angel investment financing by such variables as financing stage and technology area. The vendor shall provide documentation on the extent of its coverage and accuracy of angel investment. <br /><br />Other requirements:<br />--These data shall be available through a tool/platform that allows NCSES to easily create customized tabulations that are downloadable in Excel format; <br />--The vendor shall provide technical assistance to NCSES, including generating customized tabulations and other data and answering queries from NCSES on data, the software tool/platform, and the investor and investment climate; and, <br />The Government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price purchase order with a base period of performance of one (1), twelve (12) month period. The anticipated dollar value for this requirement is within the simplified acquisition threshold.<br /><br />Evaluation Factors:<br />Contractors shall respond with a technical and price quote. The technical quote shall clearly and fully demonstration the offeror's capabilities in regard to the technical requirements described herein.  Note: stating your firm understands and will comply with and/or paraphrasing NSF's requirements is not adequate.  <br /><br />Quotes shall provide the following:<br /><br />1.	Provide no more than a six (6) page statement outlining your firm's technical capacity to perform the described work; and,
<p>2.	Provide a firm fixed price quote. The price shall include software/data licenses for a minimum of two (2) users for a period of one year starting at the award of the contract.  Access to the data shall be limitless and must be granted on a continuous basis.  The vendor's quote must include technical support (responding to technical inquiries or providing training on the software, if appropriate), to include maintenance, in their price quote.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>The contemplated purchase order will be made using a best value source selection scheme using tradeoffs. The Government will make award to the firm whose quotation represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. The non-price factors and their relative weights are identified below.</p>
<p>Overall, the non-price factors, when combined, are; significantly more important than price in the overall selection decision.</p>
<p>Non price related factors:<br />&bull;	Data quality, including number and variety of data sources, methods, and policies for ensuring accurate, high quality data;  <br />&bull;	Coverage, including by country, technology, financing stage; and,  <br />&bull;	User-friendliness of the software tool/platform, including the ease of conducting queries and generating data tabulations.<br /> <br /> Price: 	Price will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>
<p>No alternate quote will be accepted.  No quote shall be reimbursed.  The Government reserves the right to award on initial quotes, without discussion, if considered to be in the best interest of the Government.  All offerors should submit their best price and technical capabilities to perform in accordance with the request for quotes in their initial submission.</p>

<p>CLIN 0001 - Provide helium delivery and cylinder rental compressed helium delivered to the National Weather Services (NWS) at 2242 W North Temple, Salt lake city, UT 84116 in accordance with the Statement of Need (SON) for the period of twelve months.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF NEED<br />Department of Commerce (DOC)<br />National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)<br />National Weather Service (NWS)<br />Helium for Salt Lake City Weather Forecast Office (WFO)</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Salt Lake City, UT launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 3am and 3pm MST (4am and 4pm MDT). Each balloon requires approximately 85 cubic feet (CF) of helium. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of helium (between 1200 CF and 2400 CF per week) to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying Grade A helium to the NWS office located at 2242 W North Temple, Salt Lake City, UT 84116. The total amount of helium to be delivered for the 6 month period of this requirement will be a minimum of 28,900 CF, up to a maximum of 31,960 CF.</p>
<p>4. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The base period of performance for this requirement is 12 months, beginning February 1, 2017 and ending January 31, 2018.</p>
<p>5. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office at 2242 W North Temple, Salt Lake City, UT 84116. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation building, located north (behind) of the main building.</p>
<p>6. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: The helium storage space has dimensions of 12'x20'x10'(WxLxH) and can safely store three 6-packs.</p>
<p>Initial Delivery: The contractor shall supply a minimum of one 6-pack of helium (1200 CF or more per 6-pack) on February 1, 2017. Three 6-packs are preferred, but the additional packs can be made up on a subsequent delivery due to the critical and short turnaround time for the initial delivery.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: The National Weather Service will contact the Contractor when two 6-packs are empty, and request the pickup of the empty 6-packs and delivery of two full 6-packs of helium. The Contractor shall perform the pickup and delivery in the same trip, and within four calendar days of being contacted.</p>
<p>Usage and delivery depends on how many cubic feet of helium are provided in each 6-pack, and also has the potential to vary if we have to launch extra balloons. But, at 1200 cf per six-pack, and no extra launches, we will need deliveries roughly every two weeks, based on replacing two empty six-packs at a time.</p>
<p>Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason.</p>
<p>If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within two business days of being contacted. This schedule may need to be further adjusted if at any time the helium is delivered in other-than-six-packs.</p>
<p>Performing Deliveries: The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel, at this location, when arriving for a delivery. NWS personnel will accompany the driver to the delivery point to unlock the storage area. NWS personnel will not assist with loading or unloading of cylinders. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises. <br /><br />In the event of a shortage of helium supply by the Contractor or their supplier, the Contractor is responsible for communicating the shortage to the NWS as soon as possible, but no less than two days prior to the next scheduled delivery. If the Contractor is unable to find a reasonable supply in time to fill the requirement, the NWS reserves the right to purchase helium from another supplier outside of this contract.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by an NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.<br /><br />Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact, listed in section 9 below, shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the helium being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of helium or helium is of lower purity than required), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>7. SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>8. POINTS OF CONTACT</p>
<p>The Government contacts at the NWS office in Salt Lake City are:</p>
<p>Observation Program Leader <br />Administrative Support Assistant <br />Meteorologist In Charge</p>
<p>The above parties can be reached by telephone at 801-524-4378.</p>
<p>9. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's hydrogen deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition Manual (NAM) Clauses</p>
<p>(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.</p>
<p>(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.</p>

The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.<br />3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.<br />b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2.

Submission requirements: 
Provide up to a maximum of eight (8) projects with design completed within the past five (5) years immediately preceding the date of issuance of this notice that best demonstrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above.
  Sufficient information to determine the date of completion of the project must be included in the project description or the project will not be considered.  If the project submitted was a design-bid-build (full design), then the design must be complete.  If the project was design-build, the design-build construction contract must be complete.  If more than the maximum number of projects is submitted, the Government will not evaluate projects beyond the maximum number specified in the submission requirements and projects will be evaluated in the order in which they are presented within the SF 330.  

All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and perform work under this contract.
  Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from consideration in the evaluation.  To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF 330 Part I, Section F, block 25, Firm Name Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21. Include an e-mail address and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c).  In block 24, include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, and a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above.  If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work that firm provided towards the performance of the overall project.
  If a project was performed by a joint venture, and not all joint venture partners are on the team proposed for this contract, the firm/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract.  Likewise, if the firm/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the firm/team member proposed for this contract and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the firm is a joint venture, projects performed by the joint venture should be submitted; however, if there are no projects performed by the joint venture, projects must be submitted for each joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of eight projects.
  Firms failing to provide projects from all joint venture partners will be considered to have not met the requirements of the criterion. 

Projects shall be submitted on the SF 330 at Part I, Section F and shall be completed projects.  Projects not completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not submit an IDIQ contract as an example project.  Instead, list relevant task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above.  The Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract.  Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.
  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less qualified.

All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in the SF 330, Part I, Section F. The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part I, Section F in evaluation of Criterion 1.

Criterion 2Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence (SF 330, Part I, Sections E  and  G):

Failure to provide a balanced workforce in the disciplines required to satisfy the requirements of the scope listed above will result in the firm being considered not qualified.  Specific disciplines that must be included in key personnel are quality control; task order managers; project managers; Architecture, Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, Geotechnical, and Interior Design; a licensed Fire Protection Engineer is required.  Key personnel, including sub-consultants, must be U. S. citizens and able to obtain security clearances as required.
  The design team should demonstrate knowledge of permitting in New England states, particularly Maine.  

Submission Requirements:

  Evaluating past performance and experience will include information provided in Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) or CPARS/ACASS for Criterion 1 projects and may include customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criteria.  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. 

Submission Requirements:
SUBMIT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION FOR EACH PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1.  IF A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (Attachment (A)) included in this notice is provided for the firm or its team members to submit to the client for each project the firm includes under Criterion 1, Specialized Experience.
  A FIRM SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS IS AVAILABLE.
 
IF A CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.  Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF 330.  If the firm is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, firms should complete and submit with their responses the first page of the PPQ (Attachment (A)), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).

The Government will evaluate this factor based on past performance under previous task orders, or other contracts for efforts of relevant size and complexity to the government requirement. The evaluation of the offeror's past performance information will consider relevancy (similarity in technical capability) and overall performance. To be recent, the previous contracts must be ongoing or must have been performed during the last three (3) years (36 months) from the date of issuance of this RFP.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable.</p>

The offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically through http://www.sam.gov/portal. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (s) of this provision.</p>

Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief&nbsp; as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is W911QX-17-T-0033. This acquisition is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ)<br /><br />(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-89 dated 14 July 2016.</p>
<p>(iv) This acquisition is set-aside for total small business. The associated NAICS code is 334516. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>(v) The following is a list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure, (including option(s), if applicable):</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: Design Study for Disc Holder for PHI 660</p>
<p>(vi) Description of requirements:</p>
<p>The Government requires a preliminary design study for a custom sample insertion chamber, transfer mechanism and measurement stage for the PHI 660 Auger Microscope (PHI 660 shown in Fig.2). The contractor shall provide the preliminary design study with sufficient detail to determine cost and delivery time for the custom sample system.</p>
<p>The custom sample insertion chamber, transfer mechanism and measurement stage for the PHI 660 Auger Microscope shall meet the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>The following requirements apply to three (3) types of specimens:</p>
<p>1) Cylindrical specimen (disc) with range of diameters 101.5 to 109 mm, 12.7 mm high and 950 g mass (shown in Fig. 1)</p>
<p>2) Spherical specimen (ball) with 20-22 mm diameter.</p>
<p>3) Standard PHI 660 specimen holders<br />Insertion chamber (load lock):<br />&bull; The insertion chamber shall attach to the main chamber of the PHI 660 via a standard 8" (outer diameter) CF flange.<br />&bull; The insertion chamber shall allow for the loading of all three (3) types of above mentioned specimens.<br />&bull; The chamber shall be separable from the main chamber by a gate valve withhold ultra-high vacuum (UHV) vs atmospheric pressure<br />&bull; The insertion chamber shall allow pumping to a pressure of &lt;5x10-7 Torr using an existing roughing and turbopump (Pfeiffer/Balzers TPU050) or by provided pumps.</p>
<p>Transfer mechanism:<br />&bull; A transfer mechanism shall be provided for transporting the sample from the insertion chamber at a pressure of &lt;5x10-7 to the measurement chamber (normally under UHV).</p>
<p>Measurement stage:<br />&bull; Disc area for measurement access: 16mm x16mm area whose center is 42mm from the center of the sample stage (red box in Figure 1). Only an instrument-defined spot must be measured within this area at any measurement instance.<br />&bull; Ball measurement area: position on ball surface<br />&bull; The measurement stage shall allow for the translation of the disc samples such that the disc measurement, ball surface, or PHI 660 specimen holder can be centered under the electron and ion beams. <br />&bull; The stage shall allow fine translation across measurement area to a precision of &lt;20 &micro;m. <br />&bull; The stage shall be able to tilt the specimen measurement surface to 10-15 degrees from horizontal towards the ion gun. <br />&bull; The measurement stage shall not have a vibration displacement above 1 &micro;m. Entire UHV chamber rides on an air table.<br />&bull; A Perkin-Elmer/PHI 15-630 Precision Sample Stage currently resides in the PHI 660 Instrument. The new stage shall be compatible with the Perkin-Elmer/PHI 15-630 Precision Sample Stage. If not, then a sample holder stage shall be provided, which is compatible with the new transfer stage that allows for standard PHI 660 specimen holders. The PHI 15-630 has a gear at mid PHI 660 holder height about 2 cm away from holder edge, and more mechanism at about 3 cm away that rapidly rises above standard sample holder height.</p>
<p>General requirements:<br />&bull; If the gate valve does not close during measurement due to the new sample transfer/measurement stage(s), the insertion chamber pumping system shall have an emergency shutoff to isolate the insertion and measurement chamber from the mechanical pumps.<br />&bull; The sample and holder shall not impact the microbeam ion gun (PHI 06-650, shown in Figs. 3-4) during insertion, transfer or positioning for measurement. Ion gun is roughly 2-3 cm from current sample holder, lower edge about at level of two screws on right side of current sample holder in Fig. 4.<br />&bull; Access to the PHI 660 at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD shall be provided after contract award, but not during solicitation, as this is a commercially available instrument present in numerous labs across the country that has been in the market since at least 1974.<br />&bull; Adequate (not comprehensive) detail shall be provided to demonstrate feasibility of conforming to the space and movement requirements above.</p>
<p>The preliminary design study shall be provided by the Contractor to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) by email or postal service within ninety (90) days after date of contract (ADC).</p>
<p>FIGURES 1 THROUGH 7 WILL BE ATTACHED IN SEPARATE DOUMENT.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis solicitation for the CBP Pre-Command School (PCS). Please see the attached Combined Synopsis Solicitation for further details.
<p><br />This requirement is being procured as a <strong>total&nbsp;Service Disabled&nbsp;Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) aside under NAICS code 611430</strong>.<br /><br />All proposals are due to Bryan.I.Campbell@cbp.dhs.gov by 4:00 EST, Wednesday, February 1, 2017.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to procure services for developing and delivering leadership curriculum for the CBP Pre-Command School (PCS). The PCS is a ten-day program over two-weeks designed to provide a comprehensive and systematic means of preparing senior managers and executives to assume a command position. The curriculum will focus on the critical operational and leadership mandates of a commander. The ten-day program will be 80% CBP-centric material, and 20% leadership-centric material. The Contractor will only be responsible for developing and delivering the leadership-centric curriculum.</p>
<p>The CBP PCS will provide a rigorous graduate level program of study designed to develop a broad perspective on management and leadership issues in a law enforcement organization, and cultivate strong abilities in the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs): Leading Change, Leading People, Results Driven, Business Acumen, and Building Coalitions/Communication.</p>
<p>The participants in the Pre-Command School will be a cross-functional mix of senior managers (GS-15s) and members of the Senior Executive Service (SES). This audience diversity enhances the opportunities for implementing change and integration both within and outside the classroom. Participants will be learning and applying the change initiatives across organizational lines, thus spreading the message to the rank and file. The participant mix will also reinforce networking opportunities among senior leaders. At the completion of the program, participants will be expected to perform successfully in key leadership positions at the senior GS-15 and SES level.</p>

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.</p>

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>USTDA has received inquiries as to whether the Grantee, Zarara Oil and Gas Limited ("Zarara"), has any procurement policies that restrict the prime contractor or sub-contractors from bidding on follow-on procurement opportunities related to the feasibility study.</p>
<p>In response to these inquiries, Zarara hereby provides the following clarification:</p>
<p>"Zarara Oil and Gas does not have any procurement policy that would restrict participation of contractors or sub-contractors in the feasibility study from bidding for follow on services."</p>
<p>USTDA has also received inquiries as to whether the following requirement from Sub-Task 3.3 can be waived: "The Contractor shall also ensure that the work performed for the conceptual design for the power plant is signed by a construction and/or engineering company certified in Kenya or by personnel with an architectural qualification certificate that is valid in Kenya."</p>
<p>In response to these inquiries, Zarara hereby provides the following clarification:</p>
<p>"Zarara Oil and Gas is willing to waive the requirement that the Contractor ensure that the work performed for the conceptual design for the power plant is signed by a construction and/or engineering company certified in Kenya or by personnel with an architectural qualification certificate that is valid in Kenya. However, it is important that Contractors demonstrate knowledge of and experience in Kenya and Sub-Saharan Africa in respect to construction and engineering matters."</p>
<p>USTDA has also received inquiries requesting an extension of the response date for this RFP. In response to these inquiries, Zarara hereby extends the response date for this RFP to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10:00 AM local (South Africa) time on January 13, 2017</span></strong>.</p>

<p><br />Solicitation Number: 2016-31017A<br />Indonesia: PT KAI Rail Maintenance Systems TA<br /><br />The Grantee (PT Kereta Api Indonesia, "Persero," "PT KAI") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to assist the Grantee on the Rail Maintenance Systems project.</p>
<p>To accommodate continued growth in rail passenger and freight traffic, PT KAI intends to expand its railroad network and make significant investments, such as building new track, acquiring rolling stock, and installing signaling systems.  The Indonesian government recognizes the importance of rail transport to economic development but the network requires continued modernization to function at a level needed to promote sustained growth. PT KAI does not have a comprehensive rail maintenance program, and has requested USTDA assistance for improving their overall track condition and safety in a cost-effective and operationally efficient manner. The TA would help PT KAI determine the justification for investment in a comprehensive rail maintenance program.  The TA would include a review of the railway's track maintenance practices and standards, and would provide recommendations that could lead to improvement in track condition, increases in maximum train speed, and improved safety.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $515,600 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.

<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Special Tactics Tactical Assault Kit (ST-TAK)</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA AFRL-RIK-2016-0004</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p><br /><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RI), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this broad agency announcement (BAA) for innovative technologies to enable the effective management of information for military operations.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: The disparity that currently exists between enterprise and tactical network infrastructures must be bridged to enable effective information exchange for shared situational awareness across all echelons of command. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) users, specifically those who are in the Special Tactics (ST) community, need immediate access to timely information that is critical to their mission. In order to relay that mission, a set of specific plugins must be developed first to display, store and relay that information, and then to have that information available from the tactical battlefield to the theater operational control center and then to the command center. This communication data stream may transverse across multiple disparate networks. Integrity and speed of data transmittal is crucial. The warfighter's ability to gain information superiority is largely reliant on the proximity to the tactical edge and variables such as connectivity, bandwidth and computing constraints of tactical communications. Tactical information systems complicate information transmission and receipt. The tactical edge typically is characterized by a highly contested and high threat environment. These circumstances make the availability of essential information even more important, not only for mission assurance, but for the survival of those that are in harm's way at the tactical edge. At the other end of the spectrum in the enterprise environment, these same limitations also impede the ability of commanders to reach forward to the tactical Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) required for rapid and informed Command and Control (C2) decisions that directly impact mission assurance.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: AFRL has developed the Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK) and the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) server in order to provide Information Management (IM) services to facilitate the exchange of information between a tactical end user device (along with its respective applications and data sources) and an operations center. A ST specific software configuration will be developed known as the Special Tactics Tactical Assault Kit (ST-TAK) for use by AFSOC ST operators and other interested customers.</p>
<p>In a Cellular environment (e.g. SMS/3G/4G LTE), a server is required due to the lack of a flat address space over a cellular network. In an environment where the users utilize Internet Protocol (IP) based or tactical radios where User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is permissible, the server is not required as the interface is point to point. The TAK server merges these two types of networks together and allows users to bridge the gap. AFRL has also developed a number of moving map Situational Awareness (SA) applications that run on mobile devices (Android tablets and smart phones) designed primarily for use by ST forces at the tactical edge. For information exchange, these SA applications utilize server-based IM services (TAK server) hosted at a centralized location, e.g., on an airborne platform or in a Tactical Operations Center (TOC). TAK related technologies and collaborative capabilities (e.g. plugins) operating over Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) can benefit from a client-based model of computing where mobile operations remove users from the reach of servers running IM services. Recently, AFRL has developed a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) publish/subscribe/query Cursor on Target (CoT) messaging system for Android and Java platforms. These client-based IM services operate without reliance on a centralized server.</p>
<p><strong>BAA Technology Focus Areas:</strong> The objective of this BAA is to develop and demonstrate TAK related technologies for software optimization, develop mission set capabilities through plugins in a ATAK application, develop enterprise, operational, and tactical security optimization for users, and create variable message format (VMF) capabilities that will bridge the tactical and enterprise domains. The ATAK and TAK technologies are the focus for the interoperation of tactical-edge and server capabilities. Client-based protocols will also be developed and optimized for tactical edge use that can coexist and interoperate securely with the server-based IM services.</p>
<p>The research and development to be conducted under this BAA is focused on the following: <br />&bull; Software integration and optimization for protocols and Application Programmer's Interfaces (APIs)<br />&bull; Development of ST mission set capabilities, preferably through plugins<br />&bull; Development of software VMF capability<br />&bull; Security optimization for server related technologies<br />&bull; Disruption tolerant information preservation, optimized delivery, and synchronization <br />&bull; Demonstration of the utility of these capabilities in operationally relevant environments<br />&bull; Development of ATAK and ST-TAK Plugins which are optimized for ST Mission sets</p>
<p>Other requirements include optimization of communication and transmission of information. A hybrid interoperable mix of decentralized P2P and centralized client-server IM services, gateways that facilitate the translation of incompatible data formats and protocols to enable interoperability across disparate networks, and information dissemination capabilities that are tolerant to disruptions in connectivity and infrastructure service failures will also be addressed in this BAA. Federation services will be necessary to exchange information across the boundaries of information spaces whether they are located within the networks of Continental United States (CONUS), overseas, or forward-deployed military forces.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> Included in the above optimization may be products delivered by the Global Operational Tactical Information Technology (GOT-IT) program, which serves as a complementary effort to improve the exchange of information between enterprise and the tactical edge networks and applications. The developments from GOT-IT combined with ST-TAK will allow AFRL to deliver a useable product that can be fully integrated to meet the AFSOC ST Community requirements.</p>
<p>Any required information, software or products will be provided by the Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) listed in Section VII.</p>
<p><strong>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. FUNDING: Total funding for this BAA is approximately $6.0M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. COST SHARING OR MATCHING: Cost sharing is not a requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT (SAM). Offerors must be registered in the SAM database to receive a contract award, and remain registered during performance and through final payment of any contract or agreement.

Any grant or agreement award resulting from this announcement may contain the award term set forth in 2 CFR, Appendix A to Part 25 which can be viewed at: <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=c55a4687d6faa13b137a26d0eb436edb&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=2:1.1.1.41&amp;idno=2#2:1.1.1.4.1.2.1.1">http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=c55a4687d6faa13b137a26d0eb436edb&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=<br />text&amp;node=2:1.1.1.41&amp;idno=2#2:1.1.1.4.1.2.1.1</a><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. ALLOWABLE CHARGES: The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have a <strong>government approved</strong> accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMPORTANT</span></strong>: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and the methodology for measuring and demonstrating success, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror can substantiate expertise in relevant technologies and knowledge of military application domains, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and open systems standards are proposed to be used and the relative maturity of them, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: The Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and per FAR 9.104-6 FAPIIS.</p>
<p><strong>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the TPOC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>
<p>This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Contract Applicable: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. FAPISS Applicable: As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, non-federal entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide. This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions* apply:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) FAR 52.209-07, Information Regarding Responsibility Matters<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) FAR 52.209-11, Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) DFARS 252.203-7996, Prohibition on Contracting with Entities that Requirement Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements-Representation <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk<br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. GRANT AWARDS ONLY</span></strong>: For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publically releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant. If the proposal is selected for award, the DoD will publically post the abstract to comply with Section 8123 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235).</p>

It is the Government's intent to issue additional Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) to expand competition and to allow for added interest from local hotels. In order to accomplish this, interested parties must contact the Contract Specialist no later than&nbsp;the Response Date for this announcement. An all-encompassing Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached to this announcement for interested parties to review and determine their own capability of satisfying the maximum potential requirements which may arise from the issuance of specific future requirements which will be solicited under the resulting Master BPA.

Interested sources are responsible for obtaining and reviewing the PWS by either downloading or requesting the documents from the Contract Specialist by email. All interested and capable hotels responding to this announcement will be sent pricing lists, BPA terms and conditions, and BPA call ordering procedures. An assessment will be made to determine the hotel's capability and their ability to meet security and vetting requirements once all pricing has been submitted by the hotel. If a hotel is determined to be capable of meeting any and all security and vetting&nbsp;requirements under the attached PWS, a BPA will then be issued to that hotel for a period not to exceed&nbsp;five (5) years. All questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Neal J. Axley, 410th CSB, Regional Contracting Office Miami at neal.j.axley.civ@mail.mil, or the Contracting Officer, Michael A.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide changes/updates to sections B,C,F,J,L and M, remove attachment J.4, add attachment J.7 and respond to offeror's questions. 

Refer to Summary of Changes and the revised Sections for details.  

The FAA WILL provide another amendment to answer ALL remaining Questions received.

---------------------------------------------------------------
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management Program (FSRM) office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Guan and Puerto Rico under the National Security Officer Program (NSOP).  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism.

This Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR)/ (RFP) is for Security Officer (SO) Services within the FAA Central Service Area (CSA). A complete listing of included facilities can be found in Section B of the SIR.  

1.  INTRODUCTION/DESCRIPTION
The Contractor must furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, transportation, training, and management necessary to provide SO services in accordance with the stated requirements. The Contractor must implement all necessary scheduling and personnel and equipment control procedures to ensure timely accomplishment of all SO service requirements.

2.  CONTRACT TYPE AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE 
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with three Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLINs) and one Cost Reimbursable (CR) CLIN.  The anticipated period of performance of this contract incorporates a period of 12 months base period and four 12 months option periods with security officer services expected to begin on September 30, 2017.  It is the FAAs intention that any new awardee will have an initial three month transition period prior to the security officer services start date.  The FAA will award one contract resulting from this individual Service Area SIR.

3.  NATURE OF COMPETITION
This acquisition will involve the use of streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 561612 - Security Guards and Patrol Services. The small business size standard for this code is $20.5 million.  

Tiered Evaluation: In order to provide opportunities for small businesses and to ensure that FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:

I.	SEDB/8(a) Businesses
II.	Small Businesses
III.	Other Than Small Businesses

(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.

(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.

With the exception of joint ventures, all business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers. Adequate competition exists when two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, submit priced offers that satisfy the Governments expressed requirement. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition.

Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area award but have the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on other Service Area awards without restriction. The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer. Under the first two tiers, Small Business offerors are reminded that in accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting, at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor. AMS clause 3.6.1-7 may be viewed in full text at http://conwrite.faa.gov.   Under the third tier, in accordance with Section I AMS Clause 3.6.1-4 Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan (August 2012) (c) the offeror, upon request by the Contracting Officer, shall submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan, where applicable, that separately addresses subcontracting with small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. 

Alternate proposals will not be evaluated. In the event a proposal is rejected a notice will be sent to the Offeror stating the reason(s) that the proposal will not be given further consideration.

All responses to this SIR must follow all submission instructions found in Section L of the SIR.

The FAA will not pay any costs incurred in the preparation or submission of any response to this solicitation.

Tiered Evaluation: In order to provide opportunities for small businesses and to ensure that FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:

I.	SEDB/8(a) Businesses
II.	Small Businesses
III.	Other Than Small Businesses

(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.

(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.

With the exception of joint ventures, all business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers. Adequate competition exists when two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, submit priced offers that satisfy the Governments expressed requirement. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition.

Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area award but have the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on other Service Area awards without restriction. The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer. Under the first two tiers, Small Business offerors are reminded that in accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting, at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor. AMS clauses may be viewed in full text at http://conwrite.faa.gov.   Under the third tier, in accordance with Section I AMS Clause 3.6.1-4 Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan (August 2012) (c) the offeror, upon request by the Contracting Officer, shall submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan, where applicable, that separately addresses subcontracting with small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. 

Alternate proposals will not be evaluated. In the event a proposal is rejected a notice will be sent to the Offeror stating the reason(s) that the proposal will not be given further consideration.

All responses to this SIR must follow all submission instructions found in Section L of the SIR.

The FAA will not pay any costs incurred in the preparation or submission of any response to this solicitation.

<DESC>ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFCATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD. 

Architect-Engineer (A-E) services are required for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Construction Surveillance and Inspection (Title II) Services and other design and engineering services for various National Science Foundation Projects at Antarctica and New Zealand. Services may include, but are not limited to, design, studies, reviews, construction surveillance, construction inspection (including preparation of inspection reports, weekly and end of the season reports), cost estimating, life cycle cost analysis, with emphasis on mechanical and electrical work.
 Other design and engineering services may be required to support various NSF projects. Disciplines shall primarily include mechanical, electrical, fire protection and secondarily structural, architectural and civil review. Mechanical work shall include commissioning. Personnel traveling to Antarctica must pass strict medical and dental examinations. If asbestos or hazardous materials exist, the Architect-Engineer (A-E) contractor shall identify and provide for their disposal in the required documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous materials.

Evaluation and selection of the most highly qualified firm will be based on the following selection criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 

Criterion 1.
 Firms Specialized Experience: 

Firms recent specialized experience in the design, review, studies, construction surveillance, and inspection of relevant projects. Relevant project involves heating, cogeneration, structural insulated panels (SIP), utilidors, and mechanical and electrical commissioning completed within the past five (5) years and in extremely remote, cold weather climate similar to Antarctica. 

Submission Requirements: 

SF330, Part I, Section F. Submit a maximum of five (5) relevant projects, which best demonstrate the firms recent specialized experience in design, review, studies, construction surveillance, inspection services in relevant projects. If more than five (5) projects are submitted, the Government will evaluate the first five (5) projects listed in Part I, Section F and disregard any other project information.

Each project shall include (1) project title; (2) location; (3) year completed; (4) project owner; (5) point-of-contact name, e-mail address, and phone number; (6) contract number or project identification number; (7) contract performance period; (8) contract award amount; (9) estimated construction cost; and (10) description of project and relevance to this solicitation.
 A project is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order in an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. For IDIQs, the Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract and will only evaluate individual task order information. 

The submission shall include a discussion of who executed the project as pertinent to demonstrating the firms specialized experience. If a project was performed by a joint venture (JV), and all JV partners are not on the team proposed for this solicitation, the offeror should specifically address the work performed on the project submitted by the proposed JV partner(s). If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the proposed JV partner(s), the project will be evaluated less favorably.
 Likewise, if the proposed JV partner(s) worked as a subcontractor on a project, the offeror should specifically address the work performed by the proposed JV partner(s) on the project submitted. If a project does not provide requested data, accessible point-of-contact, or valid phone number, that project may be evaluated less favorably. Note: If the A-E firm is a JV, info should be submitted for projects performed by the JV; however, if there are no relevant projects performed by the JV, submit projects performed by the individual partner entities of the JV. 

A-E subconsultants specialized experience on a Design-Bid Build project will not be given the same level of consideration as the A-E prime contractors or JV partners.
 Specialized experience of an A-E subcontractor to a construction contractor, serving as the Designer-of-Record on a Design-Build project, will be given the same level of consideration as an A-E firms for a DBB project.

 If project description does not clearly define the role performed by the proposed Architect/Engineer or if a project does not provide the requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers, that project may be evaluated less favorably or as not qualified. 

Criterion 3. Past Performance: Firms will be evaluated on past performance on relevant projects with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and cooperation and responsiveness. 

Submission Requirements:

PPIRS/ACASS will be evaluated for the firm that will perform the work and search will be based upon the DUNS number provided for the firm. If the A-E received any less than satisfactory past performance evaluations from customers/owners, it is incumbent upon the A-E to provide an explanation of the rating and what the A-E has done or will do to preclude less than satisfactory ratings on future contracts.
 

Letters of commendation or awards are not required, and if submitted, shall not be considered in the evaluation.

A-E subconsultants past performance on a Design-Bid-Build project will not be given the same level of consideration as the A-E prime contractors or JV partners. Past performance of an A-E subcontractor or subconsultant, serving as the prime A-E or Designer-of-Record on a Design-Build project, will be given the same level of consideration as an A-E firms for a DBB project. However, past performance of an A-E subcontractor or subconsultant, serving as the prime A-E or Designer-of-Record on a DB project, shall be demonstrated by the submission of a Performance Survey, as described above, and not by the prime contractors Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) or Construction Contractor Appraisal Support System (CCASS) rating.

<DESC>Southern Africa Mission Support (SAMS) activity.  

The United States Government, represented by the U.S Agency for International Development in Southern Africa (USAID/Southern Africa), intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for an anticipated award of a contract for the implementation of the Southern Africa Mission Support (SAMS) activity.

Objectives: 
The overall objective for the contract is to provide program, administrative, financial management and acquisition and assistance support services to USAIDs Missions and offices in the Southern Africa region, including the Power Africa Coordinators Office.

The objective of the Southern Africa Mission Support (SAMS) contract is to provide services to USAIDs Missions and offices in the Southern African region, including the Power Africa office, in the areas of program support, administrative, financial management and acquisition and assistance services when needed to ensure USAIDs continuing ability to successfully implement its development assistance activities in the region.  It is envisioned that this will be accomplished through the following four tasks:

Task 1:		Program Support Services  

Task 2:  	Administrative Support Services

Task 3:  	Financial Management Services

Task 4: 	Acquisition and Assistance Services

A draft copy of the Statement of Work is attached for reference.  The finalized Statement of Work will be included as part of the RFP package, if/when an RFP is eventually published.  The anticipated period of performance for this activity is five (5) years from the date of award, subject to the availability of funds.  

This procurement is being conducted as a total small business set-aside in accordance with Part 19.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services).

The purpose of this notice is to comply with the synopses and pre-solicitation notice requirements of FAR 5.2 Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions.  Any solicitation resulting from this notice will be handled in accordance with FAR 5.102(d); therefore, availability of any resulting solicitation package may be limited to this electronic medium.   

Issuance of this notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. 

All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package, which will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov and on the FedConnect web site at www.fedconnect.net. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement. Telephonic requests or inquiries will not be accepted.

<p>The use of the MATOC will provide the Government with a construction product delivery method that can accommodate quick and straight-forward projects, as well as some small but complex projects, and can help minimize design effort and related overhead expenditures, as well as handle compressed schedules. The Government will evaluate and select, for contract award, two (2) to five (5) qualified Offerors, whose Proposals are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with consideration given to both the technical evaluation factors and price.</p>
<p>Task Orders will primarily address new construction, design-build or design-bid-build, general building renovation, road and airfield pavement repair, utility work to include water, sewer, electrical, and gas, and general environmental work including, but not limited to, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete work, and environmental remedial work. This solicitation will cover the geographical area of Georgia (country).</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, a two-phase source selection process will be used to evaluate the contractors for award. Those contractors who are considered most qualified during Phase I (not to exceed five (5) contractors) will be requested to submit the proposal requirements for Phase II. Specific evaluation criteria will be provided in the solicitation documents.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of the MATOC is not-to-exceed US$30,000,000.00 for the life of the contract, which will consist of a base period of three (3) years and two (2) one(1)-year option periods. The Contract will end upon completion of the five (5) years (if all options are exercised) or upon attainment of the US$30,000,000.00 capacity. Individual projects issued under the MATOC will contain their own estimated values. There will be no limits on the number of task orders awarded/issued in any year. The minimum guarantee shall be $5,000.00. This amount shall cover the duration of the entire contract (Base Period and Option Periods).</p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers, Europe District intends to advertise the solicitation for this MATOC on or about 28 Dec 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Offeror wishes to perform some of the work using subcontractors (subject to the 25% prime contractor work requirement stated in FAR 52.236-1, Performance of Work by the Contractor), the prime contractor may use subcontractors of any nationality providing they submit commitment letters from those subcontractors. The contractor may not change subcontractors without the Contracting Officer's approval. Approval will not be given unless the contracting officer, in the exercise of his/her sole discretion, considers the proposed substitute to be equal in all respects to the originally proposed subcontractor and the contracting officer considers the substitution to be in the best interests of the Government.</p>
<p><br />The USACE Europe District Contracting Office will be the sole point of contact for this solicitation. The Primary Points of Contact for this solicitation will be as follows:</p>
<p>Contract Specialist, Ms. Candace Lotomau (Primary POC)<br />Email address: Candace.C.Lotomau@usace.army.mil<br />Telephone No: +49(0)611 9744-2819.</p>

<DESC>The commercial data provider will provide access to an XML Data Feed with a 20 Year Back file for Journals, Conference Proceedings, Books, Research Data, and Patents. This data feed should provide the capability for comprehensive citation searches that reference cross-disciplinary research to enable complex analysis of specialized sub-fields within a scientific discipline. The data feed should represent over 90 Million disambiguated and cleaned records from multiple databases that leverage a common ontology for organization and structure) based on the following technical requirements:<br />1. XML Data Feed with a 20 Year Back file for Journals, Conference Proceedings, Books, Research Data, and Patents. <br />2. The ability to host this data on a DoD cloud-based architecture (CBA). This CBA will be behind a firewall that has controlled access to the data.<br />3. Allow access for up to 50 concurrent Department of Defense users. <br />4. Will have the ability to augment the mix of supporting databases within the XML data-feeds based on the availability of new data sets such as the Russian Science Citation Index.<br />5. Training and support be made available only as required via email or phone. <br /><br />Rationale for not competing - The ONTA requires an integrated and disambiguated data library that enables analytical tool packages and data scientists with the ability to search web based databases and create trend results reports. The above described data and analytic tools will enable analysts to cohesively understand the impact of academia and commercial research development influence the development of critically important emerging technologies from a Defense perspective. The market research results confirmed that only one data source exists that has all of the required elements that the ONTA requires. Without this data source the analytical tool packages and Data Scientists would not be capable of creating the trend reports for emerging technologies and patent reports.

<DESC>Six (6) Month Extension to EP-D-11-082  High Throughput CO-Culture Cell Systems: Organ or Organism Culture Systems

Intent to Sole Source:
NAICS Code: 541712Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of services under the current contract, EP-D-11-082, as described below.  EP-D-11-082 expires on January 26, 2017.  The Government intends to compete, negotiate, and award follow on services to this contract in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  However, the contract for follow on services will not be awarded prior to the expiration date of EP-D-11-082.  The services under this contract are critical and cannot lapse.  The EPA intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Cyprotex US, LLC., 313 Pleasant Street, Watertown, MA 02472, a modification to contract EP-D-11-082 to extend services under this contract, not to exceed six (6) additional months of service, until such time that the competition for the follow-on for High Throughput CO-Culture Cell Systems: Organ or Organism Culture Systems contract is completed and a follow-on contract is awarded. 

Cyprotex US, LLC. currently provides high throughput screening of the Toxcast Compound Library using complex cell, organ or organism culture systems for the EPAs National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) Laboratory, located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, under contract EP-D-11-082 and has provided these services and support under said contract since July 2011.  The continuity that Cyprotex US, LLCs services will provide are critical to ORD research priorities and to ensure continuity of research.

There are no other entities that have the capability of providing the level, breadth, and depth of support that are required by the EPA NCCT in order to continue critical research activities with the least amount of disruption in a short period of time on a temporary basis.   

Cyprotex US, LLC. is best suited for continuing to provide the above indicated services and support for the requested six (6) month extension as they have the necessary infrastructure, personnel, supplies, and subcontractors already in place, fully functioning, and doing so will guarantee continuity of services for the EPA NCCT research activities while the Government completes the competition and award for the follow-on High Throughput CO-Culture Cell Systems: Organ or Organism Culture Systems contract.  

The Government is not stating that there are no other contractors who can provide these technical support services.  The Government understands that there are other companies that provide similar High Throughput CO-Culture Cell Systems: Organ or Organism Culture Systems services.  The Government is instead saying that considering the short period of performance contemplated within this extension and that the five year follow on contract award will be competed amongst eligible, qualified companies, that no other contractors could transition this workload from Cyprotex US, LLC. and efficiently continue performance without potential reduced services, increased costs, and unnecessary risks to the Government.  This six (6) month extension of services is not an attempt by the Government to limit competition to the incumbent contractor but to provide additional time to complete the evaluation of proposals received and the award of a follow-on contract.  

In accordance with FAR Part 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Agency.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the direction of the Government.  

This notice will be posted for 15 days.  

The intent of this synopsis is to state the Governments intention to sole source this requirement and to determine if any other source(s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required service should: 1) fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing and submit same via FedConnect, a government web portal, within 15 days from the date of this announcement; and 2) must submit itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  

Consequently, any responder(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Offerors must submit all technical questions / responses concerning this synopsis electronically through FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/Fedconnect/.  The synopsis, amendments, and other information related to this procurement as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at:  www.fbo.gov and the Fedconnect website at:  https://www.fedconnect.net/ .

At this time phone calls related to this procurement are not being accepted.
