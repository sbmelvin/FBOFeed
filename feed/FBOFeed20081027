<DESC>This is a synopsis for continued development and sustainment support of the Standard Procurement System (SPS) Procurement Desktop 2 (PD2) contract writing system, Increment 2.  It is the Government's intent to increase the maximum NTE value on the existing, sole source, IDIQ contract from $70M to $135M due to increased sustainment and support effort as a result of the executive decision to sustain Increment 2 versus deploy the web-based Increment 3.  The SPS PD2 system is the primary contract writing system for the Department of Defense (DoD), only one responsible source, CACI Enterprises, Inc., and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The statutory authorities for this requirement are 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that will not be recovered through competition and would cause unacceptable delays for SPS support throughout DoD.  In addition, due to the proprietary nature, no other contractor would be able to build upon or modify the SPS PD2 system.  Therefore, this Notice of Intent is for information purposes only and not a request for quotations or proposals.  A determination not to compete the proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Laboratory of Cell
Biology is comprised of 9 sections each working together to unravel the mystery
and decipher different aspects of what makes a cell cancerous and how we treat
it. Success in treatment of some disseminated cancers with chemotherapy has led
to intensified efforts to understand why many other cancers are intrinsically
resistant to anticancer drugs or become resistant to chemotherapy after many
rounds of treatment. Identifying genes and mechanisms critical to the
development of multidrug resistance in vivo and establishing a reliable method
for analyzing clinical samples could help to predict the development of

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541712Description:NAICS Code 541712.  Provide quote for a scientific research vessel and crew of for the collection of hydrographic profiles and sediment collection samples off the Coast of Virginia Beach.
A scientific research vessel is needed with a fully staffed, experienced and trained technical crew to perform sampling.  A minimum of six crew members with at least three crew members on watch at all times.  The crew must be well versed in the collection and interpretation of hydrographic profiles and sediment collection in order to operate equipment including trawls and dredges to meet these objectives.  The vessel must be able to withstand seas of at least 8 feet while still being able to operate the appropriate equipment to perform the necessary sampling.  A ship designed to meet ICES noise standards for fisheries is required.  
The sampling locations are: the Norfolk Ocean Disposal Site (located approximately 17 miles east of the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay)(site is a circle with a radius of 4 nautical miles), a control site (located 5 miles north and 2 miles east of the Norfolk Ocean Disposal Site)(site is a circle with a radius of 4 nautical miles), and the Fish Waste Site (located 10-15 miles to the east of Ship Shoal Inlet) (the site is a 25 square nautical mile area with the center at 37 degrees, 18.50 minutes latitude).  
The estimated number of samples consists of: 8 to 10 CTD samples, 55 sediment samples, eight (8) 20-minute trawls, and eight (8) 20-minute dredges.
The ship must also have the following equipment on board and operational: a certified, calibrated instrument capable of collecting water quality parameters (i.e. CTD and rosette); a calibrated dredge capable of collecting 8 - 10 centimeters worth of sediment from the surface of the ocean floor at a depth of at least 45 feet; and at least one (1) 20' trawl net.    The vessel must also be equipped with lines, cables, winches, and accessories required to operate all of the equipment necessary for the completion of this sampling effort.  The vessel shall conduct CTD profiles and sediment collection simultaneously.  An electronic copy of all data collected during the cruise shall be made available to the EPA research crew prior to leaving the vessel upon the mission's completion at no additional cost.  A separate (not "hot") berth for each EPA research crew member, bathing facilities, a chef, and all of the food required for three (3) hot meals per each 24 hour period on board shall be provided to the EPA research crew of at least 8 people for the entirety of the sampling expedition at no additional cost to the Government.
Due to the timeliness of this data collection, and the pending winter weather, the vessel and crew shall be available to conduct this survey during the period from date of order through the estimated completion date of November 10th, 2008, but no later than December 31, 2008.
Quoters shall provide a proposal including a fully loaded hourly rate.  The rate shall include the captain and crew's services for operating the vessel and equipment for the sampling trip.  The Captain and crew services include, but are not limited to associated costs such as docking fees, picking up and dropping off the research staff at a mutually agreeable (between the EPA and quoter) port(s), port fees, initial mobilization and final demobilization costs, fuel, provisions for the research staff, and use of the required equipment and vessel for the entirety of the sampling effort.  
The fully loaded hourly rate shall apply from the time the vessel enters the first sampling area, to the time it leaves the last sampling area.  The same fully loaded hourly fixed rate shall apply from a guaranteed minimum of 12 hours through an estimated seventy-two (72) hours, up to a maximum of 96 hours.
The Government aims to complete all of the sampling in one continuous effort.  However, if conditions warrant a break in the mission, requiring the contractor to demobilize the vessel from one of the sampling areas, demobilization/remobilization may be required.  The demobilization/remobilization lot price is fully loaded to include but is not limited to associated costs such as docking fees, dropping off and picking up the research staff at a mutually agreeable (between the EPA and quoter) port, port fees, initial mobilization and final demobilization costs, fuel, and use of the required equipment and vessel for the entirety of the demobilization and remobilization.  The same demobilization/remobilization rate applies for up to two demobilization/remobilization events.  During any demobilization/remobilization event, no CLIN001 charges may be billed. 

CLIN001	Fully Loaded Hourly Rate (The fully loaded hourly rate shall apply from the time the vessel enters the first sampling area, to the time it leaves the last sampling area.)  
$_____________ per hour  X	NTE 96 hours  =	$________________________


CLIN002	Demobilization/mobilization after the vessel enters the first sampling areaNTE 2 Lots @ $_____________________  =	$________________________

The Government intends to make one (1) award.  The following factors will be used to evaluate quotes: Technical capability and price.  The evaluation will consider technical capability as a pass/fail factor.  Quoters shall submit documentation that the quoter is technically capable of providing all of the following features/capabilities for this requirement:1)a trawl net; 2)vessel meets ICES noise standard;3)rosette and CTD on board;4)a dredge capable of collecting 8-10 centimeters of material at an ocean depth of at least 45 feet;5)lines, cables, winches, and accessories on board to operate the dredge, CTD, rosette, and trawl net;6)at least 8 berths for the EPA scientific crew; and 7)a minimum vessel crew of 6, with at least 3 on watch at all times.   
The quantities are maximum quantities.  The same unit price shall apply for each item up to the maximum quantity of each item.  The total evaluated price shall be the sum of all of the extended amounts of all of the line items.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Drafted RFI: 

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify individuals with significant expertise in international taxation who would be able to provide tax treaty arbitration services in an effort to resolve tax disputes in compliance with the newly formulated arbitration provisions in the tax treaties the United States holds with Canada, Belgium, and Germany respectively.

Please be aware, the selected individuals, whether or not incorporated, will be required to sign a confidentiality/nondisclosure agreement to protect the privacy of all interested parties, as well as identify and disclose all possible conflicts of interest. The costs associated with the procurement of these services will be equally shared between the United States and the hosting country. At this time, it is anticipated that 4-6 mandatory arbitrations may be conducted in Canada, Belgium, and/or Germany during this current Fiscal Year of 2009. 

Consistent with existing models, an ad hoc arbitration board will be established for a particular case, which will be comprised of 3 arbitrators familiar with international tax law. The United States will designate an arbitrator, the hosting country will designate an arbitrator, and together these two persons will designate a Chair person to serve as a neutral party. The Chair can not be a resident of either participating country. 

Expenses will include a per diem consistent with arbitration provisions. Each board member will be compensated for an estimated 3 days of preparation and 2 days to perform the actual arbitration services. Airfare will be provided through Transatlantic airfare. Each arbitrator will be granted traveling expenses in accordance with U.S. Federal Travel Regulations. Flights will be in accordance with IRS policy when traveling other than coach class. Meals, lodging, ground transportation, and other miscellaneous costs will also be included. 

Preference will be given to companies or individuals identified as small business entities consistent with Federal Acquisition Regulations. In addition, preference will be given to those agencies and/or individuals who can offer bilingual competencies.

All interested parties must be listed as an authorized active contractor with the Federal Government as identified in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database. Furthermore, being identified as an Excluded Party, i.e. a debarred entity, will disqualify the agency and/or individual from participating in this procurement.  

All interested parties should submit the following information in response to this notice:

1.  Confirmation of your Central Contract Registration (CCR), to include your DUNS Number.  If you are not registered, please register at www.ccr.gov.

2.  Your capabilities or experience in arbitration (as a company or as an individual), specifically, with regard to taxation matters.

3.  An explanation of at least 10 years of experience in planning or controversy resolution of taxation issues that primarily concern corporate taxpayers.

4.  An explanation of how: 
a.	During the last 10 years of your experience, at least 60% of your time at work addressed some aspect of international taxation;  OR
b.	During the last 10 years of your experience, at least 60% of your time at work addressed some aspect of international transfer pricing? 


All responses should be submitted by the response date via email to BOTH rachelle.c.vaughan@irs.gov and genevieve.colvin@irs.gov.

Contracting Office Address
Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Building 301, Room B129, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899-1640

The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a simultaneous thermal analyzer that combines thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with the potential for evolved gas analysis of a diverse class of materials. The instrument is required to provide the capability of accurately measuring with high resolution the sample mass of the material under study as the temperature of the material is changed. At the same time as measuring mass changes, the accurate determination of caloric effects such as specific heat and enthalpies of phase transitions is required. The system will be sited and used in a multi-user facility.
 
Besides the routine (i.e. varying temperature from room temperature to 600 oC) simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) experiments that will be done on this instrument there are a set of Key Experiments that will need to accurately record sample weight loss on heating of solvated materials then having the sample cooled to -150 oC under flowing helium gas. Once the sample has reached thermal equilibrium, the sample is exposed to a low flow of hydrogen gas and allowed to further equilibrate. The hydrogen gas must be isolated from the rest of the STA using the helium as a buffer gas and be compatible with any electrical components such as mass-flow controllers or valves. The hydrogen is then swapped back to helium, and the system heated to at least 500oC to record DSC and TGA responses. Since hydrogen is an extremely light molecule and adsorbed in small amounts in most materials of interest at these temperatures, the adsorption/desorption mass changes require extreme sensitivity of the instrument balance. Evolved gas analysis

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for equipment that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two responsible, qualified respondents are classified as small business manufacturers of the equipment described herein, then any competitive procurement solicited by NIST will be done as a small business set-aside.

NIST has a need for TGA/DSC instrument that would meet the following requirements:

TGA/DSC Instrument Requirements
1.1	Instrument requirements 

1.	The requirements of studying hydrogen adsorption in small mass samples requires that the Instrument have a micro balance capable of measuring the mass change with resolution of better than 25 nano-grams with low mass drift.
2.	There must be easy access to sample, easy exchange of sensors, stable position of sensor and small dead volume with a continuous buffer gas flow for evolved gas analysis.
3.	To accommodate the diverse sample material requirements of the facility, the instrument must be equipped with the ability to simultaneously install a cooling furnace and a furnace that is capable of operating from room temperature to 2000 oC. The process of interchanging furnaces must be simple and not require special tools so that a non-expert user can perform this task quickly. The furnace change must not require changing the physical connections between the low temperature furnace and the liquid nitrogen vessel and temperature/flow controllers.
4.	There must be at least 2 gas paths available for the system. A helium buffer gas and a user changeable gas that flows over the sample. This second path may contain hydrogen and all mass flow controllers and associated electronics should be suitable for that purpose. 
5.	Many samples will be air-sensitive once heated and desolvated as described in the key experiments: the instrument must be vacuum-tight and be able to reduce O2 concentrations below the 1ppm level to ensure sample integrity while in use. 
6.	The instrument must be supplied with FT-IR and Mass-Spec transfer lines that must be able to operate at a controlled temperature either simultaneously or independently.
7.	Laboratory space is at a premium, and the instrument should take up the minimum of bench space. The maximum dimensions allowable are 28 W x 28 D x 36 H with extra height available for coupling accessories. 

1.2	Manufacturer qualifications:
1.	NIST prefers that the Manufacturer shall state how many years of experience in the manufacturing and maintenance of supplying thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry equipment.  Response should include the number of years of experience for the manufacturer in this industry.


NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture process simultaneous thermal analyzer are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities tojanet.amb@nist.gov and todd.hill@nist.gov  no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such a system. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to janet.lamb@nist.gov and todd.hill@nist.gov  are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) supersedes synopsis W15P7T-08-RFI-RUS-001 and is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid, Request for Quotation, or Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.   Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this request.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives and/or Performance Based Specification(s). Parties responding to this RFI are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<BR><BR>The government is in the process of analyzing alternatives leading to the development of a program plan and acquisition strategy for the Counter Sniper Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) program.   The notional CCTV program plan and acquisition strategy is intended to cover system level requirements for fiscal years 2009-2011.  The Government plans to acquire up to 2650 CCTV systems under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a performance period covering three years.  The Government intends to include requirements for CCTV systems to include vehicle installation kits, spare parts, transportation cases, system first article and qualification testing, fielding, training, OCONUS Field Service Representatives support, maintenance/repair, and other engineering services.  A best value source selection is being contemplated for award of a single IDIQ contract that includes provision for issuance of Firm Fixed Price Delivery Orders for CCTV systems and spares and Time and Material Delivery Orders for services.  Based on current mission priorities, the government is contemplating use of the following criteria as part of its best value considerations:  delivery schedule, technical performance, cost and supportability, potential technology enhancements, reliability growth; production capacity and ability to ramp up and sustain high volume production with minimum advance notice.  <BR><BR>The Government is seeking low cost, commercial or non-developmental solutions from either Original Equipment Manufacturers or system integrators that will lead to the delivery of approximately 1000 mast mounted CCTV systems within 6 months from award.  Any subsequent CCTV system hardware orders are intended to include a notional delivery schedule of 3 months after award of the order.  The CCTV system will allow a vehicle commander the capability of observing and recording an elevated 360 degree view of the surrounding terrain during conditions of daylight, darkness (all ambient light levels), adverse weather (rain, fog, salt fog, haze, mist and snow) and dirty battlefield conditions (adverse weather, dust and smoke).  This capability will improve situational awareness and assist in detecting and neutralizing sniper and other threats to friendly forces.  The system will be capable of full operations while stationary and operate in a degraded mode (mast not fully extended) while moving at slow speeds on primary and secondary roads.  The Government also anticipates fielding (training and initial spares) and sustaining these systems through Field Support Representatives in an operational environment (OIF and OEF).  <BR><BR>The CCTV system currently envisioned would consist of a passive thermal imaging system operating nominally in the 8 to 14 micrometer spectral region. All external optics will have protective covers when not in use. This sensor is mounted on an extendable mast attached to a vehicle platform.  The sensor will be connected to an interior mounted video display, storage and retrieval subsystem. The system must provide a mast with a rate of extension/retraction to support all combat scenarios. The system should have an electronically controlled pan/tilt mechanism for positioning the sensor(s).  The field of regard for the sensor(s) is 360 degrees in azimuth and +60 degrees and -20 degrees in elevation to provide an adequate coverage volume.  The system includes a mounting kit for various platform vehicles, all cables, mounting brackets, shipping containers and other kits necessary to fully integrate and operate the CCTV on those platforms (i.e., MRAP, Stryker, M1151 HMMWV).  The minimum requirements for the system are: Thermal Imaging Sensor; Visible Color TV camera; Bore sighted Green (approximately 530 nanometers wavelength) Laser Pointer with iconic line of sight indicator; Magnification 2-4 times; Field of View sufficient to recognize a man sized target at 200 (T) to 500 (O) meters; Electronic Pan and Tilt Mechanism (+270 horizontal; +60, -20 elevation);  Horizontal and Vertical Slew Rate 35 degrees per second with an indicator for line-of sight pointing; 45 degrees per second commanded line-of-sight centering to forward position; Sensor Control-Joystick;  Autofocus; Image Stabilization (electronic or mechanical); Environmental Housing; Video Output IAW SMPTE 170M Standard for Composite Analog Video Signal NTSC for Studio Applications: dated 1994; Video Display IAW Video Electronics Standards Association Flat Panel Display Measurement Standard; System Maximum Weight target is 250 pounds or less; Max 60 watts of power when operated over the 16 to 32 VDC vehicle input power; 10-20 Foot Mast with Pneumatic or Electrical Winch Control operated from within the vehicle; and manual backup also operated from within the vehicle.<BR>All material submitted in response to this RFI must be unclassified.  Interested parties possessing the capacity to deliver products meeting the requirements outlined above are requested to provide a White Paper describing the approach to produce, manage and meet the production requirements established above and should address the following items:<BR><BR>1. Comments with regard to the feasibility of the CCTV strategies and achieving the stated goals within the time frames specified to include a supporting program schedule that represents a low risk approach to meeting the objectives outlined above.  <BR>2.  Provide an assessment of the associated risks for the CCTV program and respective risk mitigation approaches to include potential throughput challenges, production test reject rates and challenges associated with resolution of the potential top three yield problems.<BR>3.  Submission of alternative strategies, suggestions for acceleration of system delivery, test, qualification, recommendations for economic ordering quantities, economical range quantity breaks, realistic schedules for production ramp up and surge quantities, and monthly production sustainment quantities are of significant interest to the Government.  <BR>4. Technical and management approach for executing a CCTV program including a detailed design; procurement of subsystems and components and the integration of sensor components; rigorous contractor test and integration data;  supporting technical documentation; and, operation and sustainment considerations.  <BR>5.  Estimated unit prices for the CCTV system, spares, vehicle integration kits and Rough Order of Magnitude price estimates for any other system components, training, maintenance and installation and Field Service Representatives performing in an operational environment  (OIF and OEF).<BR>6. Cost impact of incorporating current technological advances beyond the minimum requirements identified above.  These areas of interest include but are not necessarily limited to:  increased magnification (with concomitant stabilization increases); increasing elevation capability to +90 degrees; optical zoom; continuous 360 degree azimuth rotation of the sensor payload; increased Field of View (FOV); increased mast height; quick release mast; variable height mast; external air conditioning power input capability; and MIL-STD 810F Environmental Qualification.  <BR>7.  Information about the current level of environmental qualification of the system being described as well as its predicted or actual reliability.<BR>8.  Information must include complete descriptions of existing products that will be available for delivery within the timeframe indicated above and must include sufficient documentation to support any claims that the system performance will meet the minimum performance capabilities contained herein. Such documentation may include system technical specifications, product brochures and related literature, performance test data, system drawings and/or photographs, or any other data to support the state of system development and or production readiness.  <BR>9.  Outline of supply chain considerations with emphasis on any known long lead items that may adversely impact high rate production in an accelerated environment and strategies to overcome potential parts obsolescence problems.  <BR>10.  Address projected monthly production capabilities to include critical subcontractor and vendor production capacity along with any limitations to ramping up to high rate monthly production and system integration considerations along with proposed resolutions to potential production impediments.  <BR>11.  Corporate capabilities ( i.e., available facilities and assets to include existing production facilities, total available square footage to include additional floor space available for expansion; amount that could be dedicated to the CCTV program, quality management programs, manufacturing process controls and configuration management control systems) and company profile (i.e., company type, US or non-US ownership, Cage code, DUNs number, size and status as listed in the Central Contractor Registration). <BR>12.  Corporate research initiatives undertaken relative to programs like the CCTV to include a discussion of internally funded RDTE activities along with the Technology Readiness Level/Manufacturing Readiness Levels for those efforts. <BR>13.

<DESC>United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is seeking information that will help the Agency explore global positioning satellite (GPS) tracking of in-transit containers.  THIS IS ONLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) to identify sources and capabilities in locating and assessing eligible GPS tracking devices for installation onto Containerized Ammunition Distribution (CAD) System containers to enhance in-transit visibility in both the Continental United States (CONUS) and overseas (OCONUS).  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.  A government requirement to provide these services is being developed, and a solicitation may or may not result.  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) is included as follows:  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

BACKGROUND:  USTRANSCOM, as the Distribution Process Owner (DPO), must develop and maintain the capability to insert, maintain, and sustain troops worldwide under any set of environmental conditions; provide for asset visibility in transit and in theater; and effectively manage the entire container fleet.  Currently, the Department of Defense (DOD) employs a variety of Automated Information Technology (AIT) devices to provide location, movement, and status data of cargo in support of In-Transit Visibility (ITV); however, this collection of AIT is land-based, infrastructure-dependent, and is limited to nodal visibility.  To achieve true end-to-end visibility of intermodal assets requires augmentation to the Radio Frequency Identification land-based status quo infrastructure.

INTRODUCTION:  USTRANSCOM is looking for sources to install eligible GPS tracking devices, either permanently or temporarily, on designated Containerized Ammunition Distribution (CAD) System containers for USTRANSCOM assessment of GPS tracking utility and feasibility.  In addition to installation, source would also ensure all devices installed are functioning properly and are correctly configured for testing.  

An eligible GPS tracking device must have passed the following tests:

1.  Key Performance Parameters (KPPs).  Meets KPP threshold and objective values per Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3170.01E, 11 May 2005, as validated by UNICORs Environmental Testing Laboratory.  KPPs are specified in attachment (file name - KPPs.doc).
 
2.  Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) certified by the Navy Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Dahlgren, VA Laboratory. 

3.  The device shall be small with general parameters of length, width, thickness of 8 inches x 4 inches x 1 inch, respectively.  

INFORMATION REQUESTED:  Contractors capable of assisting USTRANSCOM with our market research activities in locating, securing, and assessing eligible GPS tracking devices for installation onto CAD System containers are requested to submit the following information:

II.  General Capabilities:  
a) Describe specific GPS capabilities.  
b) Include who (transportation related) is using the product today and for what purpose.
c) Provide expected battery life of unit.
d) Provide size dimensions of unit (length x width x height).
e) Provide weight of unit in pounds.
f) Provide programmable features of unit.
       
III.  GPS Unit Information: 
a) Identify the GPS tracking unit by make and model.
b) Give date tested and met KPP threshold and objective values per Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3170.01E, 11 May 2005, as validated by UNICORs Environmental Testing Laboratory.
c) Give date tested and Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) certified by the Navy Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Dahlgren, VA Laboratory.
 
IV.  Testing:  Companies offering recommendations must be capable of securing up to 165 eligible GPS tracking units and installing these units to CAD containers at three CONUS/OCONUS locations.

RESPONSE REVIEW:  Any information submitted with your response that you do not consent to limited release must be clearly marked and submitted segregated from other response material.  Response to this RFI or lack thereof does not constitute any obligation on the Government to pursue a follow-on effort, in part or whole, with specific vendors or otherwise.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Animal Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) intends to establish a sole source Blanket Purchasing Agreement (BPA) with Biomerieux, Inc., for various laboratory testing supplies at the USDA, AMS, Science and Technology, National Science Laboratory (NSL), located at 801 Summit Crossing Place, Suite B, Gastonia, NC 28054-2193. (See attached list of representative supplies) Calls will be firm fixed price and will be issued to fulfill anticipated repetitive needs of the NSL for testing supplies used in analyzing potentially hazardous samples and specimens. Biomerieuxs brand name products must be used in order to be fully compatible with the NSLs testing equipment. Market research seems to indicate that other companies similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the Agencys current needs. Accordingly, the Agency has determined that Biomerieux is the only supplier that can furnish testing supplies that are fully compatible with the NSLs equipment and will not cause service-related issues. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 423490, and the size standard is 100. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitations documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products as well as three (3) references from other customers who are using these products to the Contracting Officer by 3:30 p.m. Central Time (CT)  on Friday,  October 31, 2008. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Responses received after the response date or without the required information will be deemed nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. Capability statements may be sent to: Daniel M. Kline, Contracting Specialist, USDA-APHIS-MRPBS, ASD Procurement Branch, Butler Square Building, 5th Floor, 100 N. 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN 55403, or via email @ daniel.m.kline@aphis.usda.gov or fax @ (612) 336-3550. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed BPA based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, APHIS will proceed with the sole source BPA with Biomerieux Inc.

STATEMENT OF WORK --  CONTRACT ROLE PLAYER SERVICES -- ADVANCED ADMISSIBILITY SECONDARY PROCESSING (AASP)  --  ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TRAINING PROGRAM (EOTP)  
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, (CBP) Advanced Training Center, (ATC) Harpers Ferry, West Virginia requires contract role-player services in support of training delivery for course offerings conducted at the Center for a Base year period of December 1, 2008 through November 30, 2009, plus four (4) one year renewal options through November 30, 2013. 
A.  SCOPE
1.  Role-player services will be provided on a reoccurring basis to multiple classes on a prearranged schedule as supplied by CBP to the contractor.  At a minimum role players will be used to support the Advanced Admissibility Secondary Processing (AASP) Course and the Enforcement Officer Training Program (EOTP) conducted during the specified contract period.
2. The AASP course requires up to twelve (12) role-players x eight (8) hours per class.  It is estimated that approximately 22 classes will be conducted in a FY = 1,728 hours.  Schedules will be provided to the contractor at least one quarter in advance. The number of hours is subject to change due to National security reprioritizing of CBP mission requirements and may entail discontinuation or reduction in training which may change the number of classes without notice.  In the event it is necessary to reprioritize and reduce the number f role players required or cancel a scheduled class, for other than weather or immediate national emergency response, the CBP Contracting Officer Technical Representative shall provide a 48 hour written cancellation notice to the contractor.  However, if the cancellation is weather or national emergency response related, a 48 hour notification cannot be guaranteed.   
  3.  The EOTP course requires up to two (2) role-players x sixteen (16) hours per class.  This is estimated at four, 4-hour blocks.  It is estimated that there will be up to nine classes in a FY=288 hours. Schedules will be provided to the contractor at least one quarter in advance. In the event it is necessary to reprioritize and reduce the number of role players required or cancel a scheduled class, for other than weather or immediate national emergency response, the CBP Contracting Officer Technical Representative shall provide a 48 hour written cancellation notice to the contractor.  However, if the cancellation is weather or national emergency response related, a 48 hour notification cannot be guaranteed.  
 Classes for AASP and EOTP are conducted Monday through Friday between the ATC core hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.  The specific days and eight or four  hour blocks of time the role-players will be needed are dependent upon the  overall class schedule start and finish dates.   Schedules will be provided one quarter in advance to the contractor, identifying times and dates role-playing  services are required. 
B.   ROLE PLAYER DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The role-players for the academic AASP and EOTP classes will perform a variety of roles related to Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as material witnesses and defendants and as individuals making application for entry to the United States.
For AASP and EOTP role-playing, the scripted roles and information made available to role-players during the conduct of the practical exercise is not considered law enforcement sensitive and is consistent with that information made available to the traveling public.  
In the event a role-player is needed for a scenario that is law-enforcement sensitive, prior coordination will be made with the contractor for role-players with previous law-enforcement experience.  Physical contact for other than academic role-playing will be no more than handcuffing and physical search.  
Role-players must be U.S. citizens, 18 years of age or older.
Contractor personnel who will report to the ATC and serve as Role-players are required to have completed NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK (NACI) ensuring their suitability for the duties required and access to the Advanced Training Center, a secure facility.  The NACI allows the assigned personnel to have unescorted access to the ATC.
6.   Prior role-player experience is not required    
Any scripts or external props and resources necessary to conduct the practical exercise will be provided by the ATC.
An appropriate dress code for the role-players will be coordinated between CBP and the contractor.  CBP reserves the right to reject a role-player for inappropriate dress, actions or other articulable reasons.
A lead role-player will be assigned to ensure an adequate number of role-players are present.   Lead role players will ensure a sign-in and sign-out sheet is utilized and that all role-players remain at the designated practical exercise area until the responsible officer has signed the roster and been afforded the opportunity to provide comments, if any, in the space provided.
A roster of the role-players reporting for each practical exercise shall be provided to the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) for verification and certification of invoices submitted for processing.
11.  Abide by Customs and Border Protection, Advanced Training Center guidelines for classroom management, integrity and fraternization.
12.  All vendor employees having access to the content of the training, will be asked to sign the Confidentiality Agreement provided by the vendor.
C.   SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
1.  The Contractor must conduct Employment Eligibility Verification by requiring applicants to show their U.S. Passport OR a combination of a valid state drivers license AND an original social security card or birth certification (with seal).
Each role-player assigned to work on and within the scope of this purchase order will be required to satisfactorily complete and pass a NACI with the Office of Personnel Management proof of completed background must be supplied to CBP for verification. CBP reserves the right to conduct their own backgrounds checks (no persons with a felony or misdemeanors in the last 8 years will be allowed access).
Contract employees are required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination.  Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials. 
SCA Wage Determination No.: 2005-3017, Revision No.: 6, Date Of Revision: 05/29/2008 is in effect on this solicitation.  Wage determination can be found at:

<DESC>This modification is being issued to correct the Numbered Notes issued with the original synopsis posted October 17, 2008.  All other terms remain unchanged.<BR>R-1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  Two Indefinite Delivery Contracts will be awarded for Architect - Engineer (A-E) services for a period of one year with options for four additional years each. The contract(s) will be primarily for A-E studies and design activities in support of military and Department of Homeland Security-Customs & Border Protection (DHS-CBP) projects within the Albuquerque District boundaries, which include Southern Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Southwest Texas.   The Contractor may be required to perform work outside this area.  The successful firm(s) may be utilized for complete projects or in support of in-house efforts.  Services during construction to include construction inspection, shop drawing review and as-built drawing preparation may be required.  These contracts will be procured in accordance with Pl 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36.  Work will be negotiated and initiated by issuance of delivery orders, which will not exceed $12,000,000 over the life of each contract.    The anticipated award dates are March 2009.  This procurement is unrestricted.  Where the Government has multiple Indefinite Delivery Contracts for identical services, delivery orders will be issued to the various firms based on similar project experience, expertise, workload, and performance on previous projects, with the intent to equally distribute the work.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be no less than those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act.    In accordance with Public Law 95-707, large business firms are reminded that a subcontracting plan will be required which provides for subcontracting work to small and small disadvantaged firms to the maximum extent practicable.  If any of the work is to be subcontracted, the Albuquerque District goal is for 70% of the subcontracted dollars to go to small business with the percentage of those dollars distributed as follows: 6.2% to small disadvantaged business, 7.0% to woman owned business, 9.8% to HUB-zone small business, 3.0% veteran-owned small business and 0.9% service disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB).
