<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Aircraft Operations Center, MacDill AFB, Florida, intends to procure Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometers for the purpose of measuring the wind speed near the surface when operating its two P-3 Orion aircraft to support hurricane reconnaissance and research.  In lieu of flying close to the surface, which is too hazardous in a hurricane environment, there are several techniques and instruments used to make measurements of the wind speed.  One instrument that has been used in an experimental mode is the Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR).  This procurement is for a Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer, Model SMR2000-P or equivalent.  The unit shall have the following option: Blanking pulse input (from aircraft C-Band Radar transmitter) Option SFMR2000-P-BK.  This procurement is for one production version of the SFMR, with options to purchase up to 5 more units after validation of the first unit, and within two years after award of the contract.  Currently, the company, Pro-Sensing, Incorporated, is the only known manufacturer of a SFMR designed for aircraft use.  The Government will accept a similar unit from another vendor, however, the product must be equivalent in form and function.  The specific points of equivalency are: Mechanical: Dimensions without nose fairing not to exceed 15"h x 10"w x 36"d; Aerodynamic Coefficient of Drag (Cd) not to exceed 1.0.  ProSensing unit has a semi-cylindrical nose fairing; Other shapes may be acceptable as long as the drag coefficient requirement is met. Weight not to exceed 50 lbs.  Operating Environment -  Ambient Temperature of -65 to +40 C; Altitude of 0 to 45,000 ft; Humidity of  0 to 100%; Waterproof case to withstand rain rates up to 400 mm/hr, with unit traveling up to 120 m/s True Airspeed; Construction -  conforms to Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) Document DO-167 ?Airborne Electronics and Electrical Reliability'.  Interface: Power - Requires no more than 250 Watts power.  28V DC;  Acceptable alternative is 115V AC, 50-440 Hz, inclusive.  Data output via RS-422 character stream - Output all values at 1 Hz rate or faster;  Standard ASCII representation of floating point numbers, comma or space limited. Standard Baud rate - equivalent unit must support at least one of the following two rates: 9600 or 19,200 baud.  Data input via RS-422 character stream - Used to modify center frequencies, calibration constants, etc.; Changes to be stored in non-volatile memory. Radar blanking pulse input - Jumper selectable to accept either TTL compatible or +15V, single ended, terminated in 75 Ohms; Used to suppress interference from in-band radar signals for a duration of 40 microseconds, starting with the leading edge of the input pulse.  This time period represents a 6 microsecond radar pulse, plus the round trip signal time to the ocean surface with the aircraft at an altitude of 5 kilometers.  Measurements:   Brightness temperatures - 8 frequencies in the 4.6 to 7.2 Ghz band, user configurable via RS-422 input;  Receiver bandwidth no greater than 50 MHz; Receiver Noise figure (Noise Equivalent Delta Temperature) not to exceed 0.17 degrees K with a 1 sec integration time;  Long term (1 month) calibration stability of 1 degree K or better for all frequencies;  Measurement accuracy maintained over operating range of ambient temperature, altitude and humidity.  Reference temperatures -  Measure the temperature of the following, and include in the 1 Hz data message: Antenna, Receiver switch, Noise source.  Antenna: High efficiency, linearly polarized horn antenna; Maximum beam width of 20 - 25 degrees over the range of selectable receiver frequencies;  Completely contained within the SFMR case, with a flush mounted radome.
