<DESC>Over the past six years, the Foreign Service Institute School of Professional Area Studies (SPAS) has made incremental changes and improvements in its efforts to administer and evaluate courses. These efforts encompass before-training needs assessment, as well as evaluation surveys conducted during training, after training, and as long-term follow up to training, plus measurement of customer satisfaction. Additional technical assistance is needed to take these efforts to the next level and integrate them with existing computer and online systems that benefit the SPAS School, as well as FSI in general. 

The School of Professional and Area Studies (SPAS) of FSI is seeking a contractor to develop an Information Technology Investment Portfolio System (I-TIPS) proposal to obtain funding for the proposed course evaluation and student survey system; to convert SPAS course survey and evaluation instruments to a web-enabled format, and to a scanner-enabled format where web access is not possible; to offer assistance to course managers for creating CD-ROMS and other electronic support materials for students of particular courses; to offer support to SPAS divisions in applying web-based tools and templates to administer course logistics, linked to FSI Learning Management System database applications for tracking course-related information; to expand the CSD and SPAS Intranet sites into a more robust tool for use by SPAS education specialists, instructors and course managers; and provide support to the SPAS division staff on developing other division-specific course support materials and tools.

POSITION DESCRIPTION: Human Resources Officer (PSC)

Background

The USAID/Iraq Mission is entering its transition phase from a heavily Institutional Contractor aided administrative staff to one where the emphasis is being placed on recruiting, training, and establishing a cadre of Iraqi personnel in many of the positions of the Mission.  Critical to this is establishing Human Resources Division within the Executive Office.  To these ends we are recruiting a Human Resources Officer who has a solid knowledge of USAID policies and practices and is well versed in the CAJE software for establishing and grading positions, as well as the ability to train Iraqi staff in general Human Resources issues.  The purpose of this contract will be to retain an individual for one to two years to effect this transition in the Human Resources Division and train his/her replacement to assume the duties upon their departure.

A.	Basic Function of the Position:

The Human Resources Officer will be responsible for setting up and developing the human resource management function in the USAID Iraq to fully comply with personnel management regulations and procedures of the Agency. Important function of the incumbent in this initial phase of the HRO establishment will be to select and train FSN HR personnel to reach the high level of proficiency in performing their work. 

In the course of regular HR activities the incumbent plans, directs, and coordinates all personnel management and travel services for over 300 employees of USAID/Iraq, under the general guidance and direction of the Executive Officer. This includes such functions as position classification, recruitment, processing of incoming/outgoing US personnel, negotiation/appointment of contract personnel, benefits administration, evaluation, promotion, incentives awards, separation, and maintenance of up-to-date personnel records. These responsibilities are complicated by the presence of three distinct personnel systems – US direct-hire, US / TCN PSC, and FSN (CCN) – and by the need to ensure that USAID policy and procedures are consistent with those of the larger Embassy community. The Human Resource Officer supervises 5-6 employees, including personnel and travel assistants and clerical staff.

B.	Period of Performance

This Personal Service Contract will be for 12 months, with possible extension for another 12 months. Extension will be contingent on the need for continued service, satisfactory performance and availability of funds.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209. Tel: (703) 875-4357.  Fax:  (703) 875-4009.  Email: mwebster@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Humberto Salvo, General Manager, Empresa Nacional de Transmisión Eléctrica, S.A., Pista Juan Pablo II y Avenida Bolívar, Apartado Postal No. LM-143, Managua, Nicaragua, C.A., 
Phone:  505-267-2688, Fax:  505-267-1620, e-mail: hsalvo@entresa.com.ni.
 The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to the Empresa Nacional de Transmisión Eléctrica, S.A (ENTRESA), for the development of a comprehensive plan for designing and operating an optical transport network to provide a market alternative for the Nicaraguan telecom sector.  

ENTRESA is the state-owned electric transmission company in Nicaragua.  ENTRESA, as part of their power modernization program, is installing new shield wires on their electric transmission towers to protect them from lightning strikes.  ENTRESA’s new shield wires contain 12 to 24 embedded optical fibers and only a single fiber pair is required to control their electrical switching equipment.  The remaining capacity, if made commercially available, would significantly increase Nicaragua’s national bandwidth for telecom and Internet services, would provide Nicaragua with direct access to international networks and should drive telecommunications and Internet prices down.  

The new spare fiber capacity made available in ENTRESA’s shield wire modernization program is a national asset, not only literally since ENTRESA is state-owned, but also figuratively from the standpoint of its potential to provide significant national bandwidth at lower cost as well as direct international connectivity via the Americas Region Caribbean Optical-ring System (ARCOS). Circuit costs should decrease dramatically while reliability is significantly enhanced.  This project should enable significant decreases in the cost of Internet services, leased lines and switched voice, data and multi-media services in Nicaragua, thus accelerating e-Commerce and trade capacity.  It will provide backbone capabilities to support voice, data and multi-media over Internet Protocol (IP) in the future.  It should also allow the country to attract international investors whose factories, laboratories, offices, call centers and facilities require high-speed, reliable and secure telecom services.

While there does exist a high-capacity fiber-optic network on the Caribbean coast, the ARCOS Network, there are no telecommunications facilities available to connect Managua and the heavily populated pacific coast to this capacity (currently dependent upon an inefficient low-capacity microwave network from Costa Rica).  In pursuit of developing this high-value connection, ENTRESA, the national energy transmission company, has budgeted US$3 million to extend fiber-optic cable along their currently existing electric transmission towers around Managua and from Managua to the Caribbean coast.  While the commercial availability of the necessary physical infrastructure presents a significant opportunity to enhance the Nicaraguan telecommunications sector, that in itself is far from sufficient.  The major hurdle in this project development is that ENTRESA has no experience in telecommunications.

The objective of this technical assistance is to 1) assist ENTRESA in the design, development and evaluation of options for an efficient business model (dark-fiber provider; Joint Venture with carrier/operator; “carrier’s carrier structure”, etc.); and 2) development of an investment-quality Business Plan for ENTRESA that addresses the market, network design and financial aspects of the fiber business for whichever commercial model is selected and licensed.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following: 

Task 1: Perform Market Research and Analysis
Task 2: Assess Telecom Sector Capabilities and Plans
Task 3: Determine Stakeholder Objectives for Commercialization of ENTRESA Fiber-optic 
Capability
Task 4: Evaluate ENTRESA’s Telecom Capabilities
Task 5: Develop Business Model Alternatives for ENTRESA
Task 6: Facilitate the Assessment and Selection of ENTRESA’s Operating Model
Task 7: Develop Final Business Plan for ENTRESA’s Telecom Line of Business
Task 8: Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $359,420 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 12:00pm local Managua, Nicaragua time, April 20, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. D00026. These solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this acquisition is R699 and the North American Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611. The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Herbert Z. Wong & Associates for a continuation of services to analyze and interpret results of a cultural survey, which they have already designed and tested. The contractor will review any available previous organizational survey results, if available, including the Survey of Organizations, exit interviews, quality of work-life survey results and elements of the Human Capital Standards for Success and High Performing Organization standards that will assist the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in analyzing and interpreting the inclusive and comprehensive survey instrument that is now in place. The following FAR Clauses shall apply to this solicitation: 52.212 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.214-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers. All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above. The award is being issued on a sole source basis because Herbert Z. Wong and Associates has already conducted the survey and the findings need to be explained and discussed with the individual offices. They currently hold a comprehensive repository of Rensis Likert Associates, Inc. (RLA) survey instruments, metrics, and analytical procedures. RLA, Inc. is the firm that is now defunct, but conducted the 1996 CDER survey. It would be more cost effective to use this company since they have historical data. It would be cost prohibitive to start with a new contractor due to the time and effort it would take to gather this data. All questions should be submitted in writing via e-mail to TONEILL@OC.FDA.GOV or fax to 301-827-7101. FAR provisions can be found at the following website: http://www/arnet.gov.

1.  Introduction:    Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) provides the foundation for network-centric operations by creating a set of nine core services for joint and service systems to use. NCES is part of the larger Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Services (ES).  The GIG ES supports the entire Department of Defense’s Information Technology (IT) requirements, including the Business and Warfighting domains, as well as interfaces with the national Intelligence Community (IC) domain.

As the enterprise services component of the Global Information Grid, NCES is the infrastructure on which Department of Defense (DoD) computer applications (e.g., C2, Combat Support, and Medical) rely.  This new environment must (1) support posting data to common storage spaces as early as possible; (2) alert edge users to changes in relevant DoD information or time-critical events affecting their survival or threatening their mission; (3) provide users, down to the last tactical mile, with the capability to pull whatever they want, whenever they want, from wherever they are and limited only by the commander’s information management policy; (4) ensure information assurance (IA)/security; and (5) support interoperability among allies, coalition, and multinational partners.  NCES relies upon the GIG transport services and tactical communications systems for the exchange between the Core Enterprise Services (CES) and the Community of Interest (CoI) capabilities.  Transport is not an inherent component of NCES; however, the CES are dependent upon adequate bandwidth and availability of the GIG infrastructure to support the domains and CoIs.  

Data has grown in value to become the primary asset of most industries today, causing the data-centric model to be accepted by most enterprises including the DoD. The CES Storage Services architecture (SSA) will offer Enterprise and Communities of Interest (COI) users a 24x7 service that is completely shareable by heterogeneous computers from a single logical data image, anywhere in the GIG, at any time, with consistent centralized management. The SSA will also provide reliable and persistent data storage. The Storage Services architecture amalgamates 3 basic Storage paradigms: Direct Attached Storage (DAS), Network Attached Storage (NAS), and Storage Area Networks (SAN).

1.1. DISA is specifically interested in products and services for Storage Area Network (SAN), Network Attached Storage (NAS) Direct Access Storage (DAS), storage architectures, and products that support high-speed Fiber Channel connections.  In addition to the classical SAN architecture employing a storage Fiber Channel network between hosts and storage devices, an all-IP data and storage network using the iSCSI protocol should be considered. A network incorporating iSCSI SANs need use only a single network infrastructure (Ethernet) for both data and storage traffic, allows shared access to storage, allows exploitation of IP-based protocols such as IPSec, allows standard off-the-shelf network components (Ethernet) and is consistent with the Global Grid all-IP architecture. Full interoperability across different vendor platforms using Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP, a future SAN-based standard) should be considered.  Any products should be categorized using the following classification (these are listed in preferred order of priority):

1.1.1. Current state of the art hardware and software, services in use today.  As used here, current refers to a system, hardware, or software that is installed and operational for at least one customer.

1.1.2. Imminent release system, hardware and software, services (available today, but not necessarily fielded in an operational network to date)

1.1.3. Announced products and other forward-looking statements or documents. 

1.2. Storage Area Network (SAN) Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices that support high-speed Fiber Channel connections:  DISA is interested in state of the art SAN and NAS products that support high-speed Fiber Channel, SCSI, iSCSI connections. All types of SAN and NAS products shall be considered that support high-speed Fiber Channel connections. 

2.  Requirements/Capabilities:

2.1. Storage Information Assurance & Security:  Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Storage Services shall provide the capability to protect the information stored from unauthorized disclosure, modification, and denial of access in accordance with DoD and/or DCI IA requirements, as appropriate.  The storage service relies on IA to provide storage level authentication, confidentiality, and access control. 

2.2.  Protected Storage Environments: NCES Storage Services shall provide protected storage environments that support the day-to-day and long-term data and information access, archiving, retrieving, staging, and delivery of Core Enterprise Services (CES) and Community of Interests (CoIs) in multiple locations and operational environments as needed to support DoD data and information requirements. CES storages services shall provide availability, integrity, and confidentiality for all information stored.  Establish end-to-end protected storage environments to support all nine Core Enterprise Services (CESs).  Establish end-to-end protected storage environments to support all nine CESs and one or more Increment I CoI services. 

2.3.  Storage Service Availability:  NCES Storage Services shall provide access to and visibility of all data and information based upon the GIG user’s privileges, access, and the GIG digital security policy.  Demonstrated ability to provide available storage services to the war-fighter or decision maker on demand and shall be responsive to the criticality of the information to be exchanged. CES shall only provide visibility to the information that authorized users can access.

2.4.  Storage Service Data Retention & Archiving:  NCES data and information shall be stored in a manner that meets required mission and regulatory retention and archival requirements and does not violate the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the information stored. The storage process shall be transparent to the user.  The storage system must provide back-up capability to retain data and information for legacy systems and one or more CoI services in accordance with Operational and Service Level Agreements (OLAs/SLAs).  Retention shall meet all legal or other regulatory requirements for legacy systems and all defined CoI services in accordance with OLAs/SLAs. 

2.5.  Storage Service Infrastructure Management:  NCES Storage Services shall provide ESM with the capability to manage the storage infrastructure and the visibility needed for management in near real-time.  CES ESM shall manage the storage infrastructure to support near real-time changes in response to validated user requirements.  Retention shall meet all legal or other regulatory requirements for legacy systems and all defined CoI services in accordance with OLAs/SLAs

2.6.  Storage Service Integrity:  NCES Storage Services shall not alter stored data and information in any manner that compromises the integrity of the data and information. Storage services shall have the capability to detect when information has been modified.  The integrity of data and information stored shall not be compromised by the technologies and techniques employed.

2.7.  Storage Service Interoperability:  NCES Storage Services shall be standards based and provide clearly defined and documented interfaces, which can be utilized by non-NCES data and information processing environments.  Demonstrate interoperability with non-NCES DoD storage environments.  CES shall use standards for storage service.  Demonstrate interoperability with other government storage environments.

2.8.  Storage Service Retrieval and Distribution:  NCES data and information shall be stored in a manner that facilitates its timely retrieval, recovery, real-time information management, and distribution in accordance with entity processing, storage needs, and access control criteria. The ability to retrieve, recover and make data and information available to entities, legacy systems, and one or more Increment I CoI services in accordance with Operational and Service Level Agreements (OLAs/SLAs) without compromising the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the information.  The ability to retrieve, recover and make data and information available to entities, legacy systems, and all Increment I CoI services in accordance with OLAs/SLAs without compromising the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the information. 

2.9.  Storage Service Survivability:  NCES Storage Services shall prevent the loss and/or corruption of stored enterprise data.  The ability to fully restore and/or recover lost data and information both stored and in transit for all nine Core Enterprise Services (CESs) in accordance with Operational and Service Level Agreements (OLAs/SLAs).  The ability to fully restore and/or recover lost data and information for all nine Core Enterprise Services (CESs) and one or more increment I CoI services in accordance with Operational and Service Level Agreements (OLAs/SLAs).

2.10.  Storage Load/Capacity/Throughput: Storage load/capacity/throughput performance is often expressed in data units per period of time (i.e. a measure of the amount of work performed by a system over a period of time).  In communication systems this can be measured in bits or bytes, while in a services context this can be measured in terms of requests for service or transactions over a period of time.  The ad-hoc storage throughput I/O rate shall be XXXK / XXXK accesses / per second (e.g. one XXXK access per concurrent user/second) to support all NCES capabilities that have a dependency to the storage capabilities. The ad-hoc storage throughput data rate shall be X Mb / second / per XXK concurrent users to support all NCES capabilities that have a dependency to the storage capabilities. 

2.11.  Storage Response Time: Response time refers to the elapsed time between the end of a service request or demand on a service provider and the beginning of a response. In other words, it is the time a system takes to react to a given input. For example, in a data oriented service, the system response time is the interval between the receipt of the end of transmission of an inquiry message and the beginning of the transmission of a response message to the station originating the inquiry.  The ad-hoc storage response time shall be XX seconds for retrieval to support all NCES capabilities that have a dependency on the storage capabilities.

2.12.  Storage Availability: Storage service availability is defined as the degree to which the service is operable and in a committable state (e.g. ready to be used at any given time).  It is the ratio of the total time a service is capable of being used during a given interval (e.g. one year) to the length of the interval.  The ad-hoc storage shall be available (up and operable) XX% as measured over a period of a year to support all NCES capabilities that have a dependency to the storage capabilities. 

2.13.  Storage Accuracy: Storage accuracy is the degree to which the service provider’s actual output or response conforms to its service specifications for a given request or input value.  The ad-hoc storage accuracy shall be XX from storage point to receipt point to support all NCES capabilities that have a dependency to the storage capabilities.  Percentage/Total

2.14.  Storage Services:  Security, availability, scalability, manageability and disaster recovery are key. 

1.  A Storage service shall enforce location transparency.  (The physical location of a resource shall not be visible to requesting components.)

2.  A Storage service shall enforce implementation transparency. (The means of managing and storing information shall not be visible to requesting components.)

3.  A Storage service shall ensure that the information that it is handing will not be lost due to system or human error.

4.  Storage services shall conform to a standard interface for local information discovery

5.  Storage services shall conform to a standard interface for information retrieval.

6.  Storage services shall conform to a standard interface for information update and insertion.

7.  A Storage service shall be classified as one of more of these types:
File Server (discrete files), Data Server (seamless data store, e.g., relational DB), Streaming Data Server (data in a continuous stream e.g., video), Interactive Streaming Data Server (data in a stream that can be client controlled, e.g., JPEG 2000, Real-time data Server

8.  Where a Storage Service functions as more than one of the types above, that service shall expose each type as a separate interface and register them as separate services for discovery.

3. Definitions.  The following definitions are provided:

3.1. Storage Area Network (SAN):  A SAN is also referred to as a storage-area network. A SAN connects multiple servers and different storage devices on a single network.  SANs use technologies such as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) and Fiber Channel to provide fast and reliable connectivity between the storage devices and the servers that use them.
 
3.2. Network Attached Storage (NAS):  Network-attached storage is a disk storage system in which the NAS server is attached to another server through the network redirector by using a file sharing protocol (such as server message block [SMB], Common Internet File System [CIFS], or network file system [NFS]).  You can access the network resource if you map a drive to the network share, or by using a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path (for example, \\ServerName\ShareName).

3.3. High-speed Fiber Channel:  A channel provides a direct or switched point-to-point connection between the communicating devices.  A channel is typically hardware-intensive and transports data at the high speed with low overhead.  Fiber Channel (FC) was to develop practical, inexpensive, yet expendable means of quickly transferring data between workstations, mainframes, supercomputers, desktop computers, storage devices, displays and other peripherals.  Fiber Channel is the general name of an integrated set of standards [1] being developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  Fiber channel is a high performance serial link supporting its own, as well as higher-level protocols such as the FDDI, SCSI, HIPPI and IPI (see chapter 7).  The Fiber Channel standard addresses the need for very fast transfers of large amounts of information.
3.4.  Direct Access Storage:  The "direct access" means that all data can be accessed directly in about the same amount of time rather than having to progress sequentially through the data. 

4. Questions.  Responses to the following questions should address the Storage Area Network (SAN) and Network Attached Storage (NAS) products that support high-speed Fiber Channel connections.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric distribution system, the water distribution system and the wastewater collection system at Fort Myer, Virginia and Fort McNair, Washington D.C.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  

The Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:

Installation: Fort McNair

Location: Fort McNair, Washington D.C.

Installation Description: Fort McNair is a U.S. Army Installation located in the southwestern portion of the District of Columbia, very convenient to the National Airport and the Pentagon. Approximately 1,000 military personnel work within the Installation’s 98 acres.

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.	Electrical Description:
Ft. McNair is supplied 13.8 kV electrical power from two Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) feeders, No. 14639 and 14642, at 4th and P Streets, and a second service is supplied separately by PEPCO feeders, No. 14637 and 14639, at switchgear near 2nd and T Streets, which serves only Building 62, Marshall Hall.  All PEPCO feeders originate at Buzzard Point generating station ‘B’.  The main Installation feeders terminate in a government-owned, medium voltage set of switchgear located in a “sheltered aisle double row” enclosure adjacent to P Street. The installation has approximately 44,000 linear feet of electrical distribution lines.

The original 1922 street lighting at Fort McNair has been replaced and includes protective equipment and magnetic contactor with photoelectric cell controls in several existing distribution vaults, as well as new cables and supplementary new distribution ducts.  The former series street lighting standards were converted so each unit includes a regulated ballast, and a single 100-watt mercury vapor lamp.  The existing system is generally adequate to support present facilities.  Street lighting provides adequate light for both vehicles and pedestrians.  A 16-foot high standard light fixture is used along streets and paths at Fort McNair.  Spacing of light standards on primary streets is 80-feet on center.  On secondary streets, lights are spaced at 150-feet on center. In large parking lots and recreational facilities, 25-30 foot tall light standards are utilized.

b.	Wastewater System Description
The wastewater system at Fort McNair consists of gravity sewer collection system within the Fort McNair boundaries. There are no wastewater lift stations or treatment facilities within Fort McNair. All wastewater generated within Fort McNair flows by gravity to one of five connection points to the District of Columbia sewer system. Two of the connection points are at the northern installation boundary and connect to the District of Columbia 12/15 inch line along P Street. The western most connection along P Street serves approximately 10 non-family type buildings located in the northwestern section of Fort McNair. The eastern most connection serves the remaining northern non-family type buildings, the family housing along 4th Avenue, and the 10 most northern family housing units along 2nd.  Two other connections to the District of Columbia system are along 2nd Street. One of these connections is only for Building 62 and the other serves family housing along 2nd Avenue and four non-family housing building. The final connection to the District of Columbia system is near the intersection of V Street and 5th Avenue. This connection serves Buildings 59 and 61.  The entire wastewater distribution system is approximately 13,000 linear feet in length and varies in pipe size from 2.5 – 12 inches.

c.  Water System Description
The water distribution system at Fort McNair consists of water mains, fire hydrants, and isolation valves within the Fort McNair installation.  There are no booster pump stations, storage tanks or treatment facilities within Fort McNair, nor are any required. The District of Columbia Department of Environmental Services supplies water to the Installation. 

The water system within the Installation is operated and maintained by Installation personnel. The water distribution system in Fort McNair was upgraded in 1988. 

The water system within Fort McNair provides water for both domestic and fire protection use. With few exceptions, lines are located adjacent to roadways and fire hydrants readily accessible and each fire hydrant has its own isolation valve. Isolation valves are located near most pipe intersections making it easy to isolate portions of the system. The normal distribution pressure is approximately 55 pounds per square inch (psi) and is adequate for fire protection since the majority of the buildings are under three stories.  The water distribution system for the installation is approximately 17,000 linear feet in length.

Installation: Fort Myer

Location: Fort Myer, Virginia

Installation Description: Fort Myer is a U.S. Army Installation situated along a high bluff just west of the city of Washington, D.C., directly across the Potamac River and contiguous to the western boundary of Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.  Electrical Description
Ft. Myer currently purchases wholesale electrical power at 13.8 kV from Dominion Virginia  Power Company (DVP) at a single delivery point, the Main Switching Station, Building 215.

The switching station was constructed in 1993 and consists of 13.8 kV metal clad switchgear housed in a brick/masonry building, (see Ft. Myer 13.8 KV Single Line diagram at the back of this section).  The switchgear is configured as two 13.8 kV, 1200A, 3-phase bus sections.  Bus No. 1 is normally supplied from DVP Feeder No. 14646 (891) via a 1200A, 13.8 kV, 500 MVA vacuum circuit breaker with a second incoming circuit breaker for emergency supply from DVP Feeder No. 14649 (907).  Bus No. 2 is supplied from DVP Feeder No. 14647 (896) in the same configuration as bus No. 1.  DVP feeder No. 14649 supplies the emergency circuit breaker on each bus and automatically closes when normal power is lost from feeders 14646 or 14647.

The Fort Myer electric distribution system consists of four independent 13.8 kV underground feeders numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Each feeder supplies power to its own set of buildings throughout the Installation.  The feeders are organized in two pairs.  Feeders 1 and 2 are a pair, as are Feeders 3 and 4.  At the end of each pair is a normally open loop-switch that, if closed, electrically connects the pair of feeders into a single loop.  Feeders No. 1 and 2 can be tied by closing a normally open, loop feed switch at TV-5.  Similarly, post feeders No. 3 and 4 can be tied by closing loop feed switches at NTV-18 and NTV-20.  These four feeders are in underground ducts throughout the Installation and supply power to 63 transformer stations. 

The underground feeders were installed in 1967.  The conductor material was not indicated on the drawings, however, previous studies indicated that the primary feeders are, primarily, #4/0 copper or 350 KCM aluminum with XLP insulation.  According to the Department of Public Works & Logistics (DPWL) personnel, approximately 25% of the current feeder cabling inventory is newer, having been replaced or added to, however, the areas served by the newer cabling was not identified in any of the information provided. A Study performed on the Fort Myer electric distribution system in 1996 by STV/Lyon Associates stated, “The capacity of the four government owned feeders is, theoretically, 6600 KVA (290 A) each.”  The Study further observed that, due to their age, “... the dielectric strength of the insulation has probably decreased to some extent, therefore they should not be loaded to maximum capacity.”

The 13.8 kV underground feeders are installed in Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) ductbanks ranging from 1x1 to 2x3 ductbanks and generally four or more feet deep.  The manholes are a mixture of brick, poured-in-place and pre-cast.  The manholes range in size from 4’x6’x5’ to 8’x10’x6’.  While recent surveys have found the manholes to be in generally good condition, many manholes are subject to fill or partially fill with water, which has led to cable or splice failures.

b.  Wastewater Collection System
The wastewater system at Fort Myer consists of the collection system and two lift stations.   Fort Myer does not have any sewage treatment facilities.  All wastewater generated is transferred to Arlington County (County) for treatment.
The wastewater collection system dates back to the 1950s.  The pipe materials are terra cotta, cast iron, and PVC (polyvinylchloride). In recent years PVC pipe has been used in new construction and pipe replacement.  All wastewater facilities are owned, operated, and maintained by Fort Myer personnel.

There are four discharge points through which the collected wastewater exits the Installation boundary and ultimately reaches the County for treatment. One of this discharge points is located on the west side of the Installation and flows directly to the County’s system. Two discharge points are located on the east of the Installation through which the collected wastewater flows through Arlington Cemetery system. The fourth connection point is on the south end of the Installation by which the collected sewer discharges to the Henderson Hall area system that is owned and operated by the U.S Marine Corps.

c.  Water System Description
The potable water system at Fort Myer consists only of a water distribution system and no water treatment facility.

Fort Myer is supplied with potable water from two independent sources; one is the Washington Aqueduct Division and the other is Arlington County, Virginia Department of Public Works.

There is only one potable water pump house in Fort Myer.  There are three pumps in the pump house.  All three pumps are of 1930 construction and have 2,300 Volt motors. The pump switchgears were upgraded in 2001. The pumps are very old and the motor voltage is unique that finding spare parts is very difficult. The pumps failed in 2000 and from that time the Installation uses water from the Arlington County only. The pumps are housed in a 30’x 22’ x 10’ building.

There is one water storage tank at the Installation. In 1998 the tank was stripped of old paint and repainted. The tank operates at a reduced capacity of 350,000 gallons as the tank overflows beyond this capacity.

When the water source is from the County the water pressure is greater than the hydraulic grade of the tank. Therefore, the tank does not operate with the Installation distribution system. To overcome this, the tank is manually operated to periodically drain the tank and fill it to keep the tank water fresh.

The Contractor(s) proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential Offeror's shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.  The utility systems being privatized are described as follows:  
FORT MCPHERSON:
Fort McPherson is located in the city of Atlanta, four miles southwest of downtown. It covers 487 acres of well-landscaped grounds. Fort McPherson operates a sub-post, Fort Gillem, which is a 1,500-acre site located 10 miles southeast of Atlanta.  Electrical Distribution System:  Fort McPherson currently purchases electric power at 12.5 kV from Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) at a single primary delivery point. Two Georgia Power 34.5 kV transmission circuits, one overhead construction and one underground supply the central commercial area.  Fort McPherson owns and operates an electrical distribution system consisting of: one 12.5 kV distribution substation; approximately 4.3 circuit miles of overhead primary distribution line; and approximately 2.8 circuit miles of underground primary distribution line.  The main substation, which supplies the entire Installation, consists of two incoming 34.5 kV transmission line bays, two 7.5 MVA 34.5 – 12.5 kV transformers, three 333 kVA voltage regulators, and five 12.5 kV feeder vacuum circuit breakers. Georgia Power owns the 34.5 kV switching and protective equipment, and the two power transformers. Fort McPherson owns the 12.5 kV vacuum circuit breakers.  The primary distribution system consists of five 12.5 kV circuits. The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (which is conventional, open wire construction) with pole-mounted transformer banks. In addition, there is also a small amount of underground primary construction, utilizing both direct burial and duct type construction practices.
Natural Gas Distribution System:
Fort McPherson purchases its natural gas requirements from Atlanta Gas Light Company (“AGL”), under interruptible gas Schedule I-21 Commercial Rate.  A Propane Air Plant located at Fort McPherson was constructed, and is owned and operated by a contractor, Systems Corp.  The natural gas or the propane air mixture (during natural gas interruption) is distributed throughout the Installation through a distribution system with pipes ranging in size from less than two inches to six inches in diameter.  The total length of the system is 50,500 linear feet, serving about 103 buildings.  The system was originally installed in the 1950s; however, some of the system was installed as late as 1986 and 1996. PLEASE NOTE:  Fort McPherson will require all future renewals/replacements/upgrades of overhead lines, pole mounted transformers and all overhead facilities to be replaced with underground line, pad mounted transformers, and underground facilities. 

FORT GILLEM:
Fort Gillem is a sub-post of Fort McPherson. Fort McPherson is located in the city of Atlanta, four miles southwest of downtown. It covers 487 acres of well-landscaped grounds. Fort Gillem is a 1,500-acre site located in Forest Park, 10 miles southeast of Atlanta. Fort Gillem is home for the 1st U.S. Army and the U.S. Army Southeast Region Recruiting Command.  Electrical Distribution System Description:  Fort Gillem currently purchases electrical power at 12.5 kV from Georgia Power at a single primary delivery point near the north boundary of the Installation. Fort Gillem owns and operates an electrical distribution system consisting of: one 12.5 kV distribution substation; approximately 17.1 circuit miles of overhead primary distribution line; and approximately 1.0 circuit mile of underground primary distribution line.  The main substation, which supplies the entire compound, is a conventional, outdoor, air-insulated substation consisting of two incoming 115 kV transmission line bays, one 20 MVA 115 – 12.5 kV power transformer, and a 12.5 kV secondary structure. The secondary structure is configured with a main oil-filled circuit breaker, a main and transfer bus, voltage regulators, and four feeder oil-filled circuit breakers. Georgia Power owns the 115 kV switching and protective equipment, and the power transformer. Fort Gillem owns the 12.5 kV structure, buswork, voltage regulators, and oil-filled circuit breakers. This substation provides voltage regulation, control, and over-current protection for four 12.5 kV overhead feeders.  The majority of the distribution circuits are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits. The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (which is narrow-profile, open wire construction) with pole-mounted transformer banks. There is also a small amount of underground primary construction (utilizing duct type construction practices and pad-mounted transformers). The major underground primary facilities are arranged in a looped configuration.  Natural Gas Distribution System: Fort Gillem purchases its natural gas requirements from Atlanta Gas Light Company (AGL), under interruptible gas schedule I-21 Commercial Rate.  There is a Propane Air Plant at Fort Gillem that is owned and operated by a contractor, Systems Corp.  The natural gas or the propane air mixture (during natural gas interruption) is distributed throughout the installation through a distribution system with pipes ranging in size from less than two inches to six inches in diameter.  The total length of the system is 63,030 linear feet, serving about 119 buildings.  The present gas system was installed in 1996.  PLEASE NOTE:  Fort Gillem will require all future renewals / replacements / upgrades of overhead lines, pole mounted transformers and all overhead facilities to be replaced with underground line, pad mounted transformers, and underground facilities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>040204
<CONTACT>Connie Houpt, 405/954-7820
<DESC>Modification #1 is issued 3/16/04 to correct pertinent information in this announcement.  As a reminder, this is a Request for Information ONLY, procurement action is not planned at this time. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking information about the availability of a single cell battery tester for discharging and recharging 2 Volt batteries.  This tester will be used for the 24,768 batteries associated with the 129 operational UPMs (Uninterruptible Power Module/Systems) at the Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) Critical and Essential Power Systems (ACEPS) sites for Enersys (formerly Exide) battery models DDV85-33 and DDV95-33.  The DDV85-33 batteries are 1360 Amp Hour batteries that need 1248 Amps to discharge to 1.75 end volts at the 15-minute rate, whereas the DDV95-33 is a 1520 AMP hr battery that needs 1344 Amps to discharge to 1.75 Volts at the 15-minute rate. The tester should also be capable of performing on the E-UPS (Test Uninterruptible Power System) batteries, model number DDV75-21, and 48V control batteries, model numbers DDV40-19 and DDV40-13.   The UPMs provide backup power to critical National Airspace System (NAS) facility equipment during commercial power outages.  Failure of a UPM during a commercial power outage can disable critical equipment, such as radar screens.  A delay in bringing a UPM back on-line can cause a major disruption in air travel nationwide.  With battery testers at each site, system specialists can recharge individual batteries as they weaken, rather than recharging an entire battery string of 192 batteries each time an individual battery is underperforming.  This will extend the life of these critical UPM batteries and reduce the occurrence of UPM failures. The FAA is contemplating a one-time acquisition of 30 battery testers. The proposed tester must meet all of the following salient characteristics. SINGLE CELL TESTER/CHARGER SPECIFICATIONS 1.  The single cell charger/tester shall provide a programmable load to the cell up to 1344 Amps. 2.  The single cell charger/tester shall have the ability to step charge a single cell IAW IEEE 1188. 3.  The single cell charger/tester shall operate the testing/discharge and charging without removal of the cell from the string. 4.  The single cell charger/tester shall be able to provide a report that is transportable via e-mail. 5.  The single cell charger/tester shall be programmable (adjustable) to provide the output voltage during a charge to include equalization levels. 6.  The single cell charger/tester shall have a load that is adjustable up to at least 1344 Amps. 7. The single cell charger/tester shall be able to complete a discharge test and recharge unattended. Respondents are required to provide, for FAA review, the characteristics of their product in the same terms and units listed above.  All products submitted must meet each of the seven salient characteristics. This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  No prices/pricing information is to be submitted at this time.  Technical documentation/descriptive literature must be received by the FAA, Customer Service Desk (AMQ-140), 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73125, no later than 3:00 p.m. CST, Apr 2, 2004.  Hand-carried responses (or responses sent by overnight delivery) shall be delivered to Room 321 of the Multi-Purpose Building located at 6500 South MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169.  Required technical documentation must be sealed and labeled as follows:  Technical Documentation; RFI # 59-AML; due 3:00 p.m. CST, Apr 2, 2004. Respondents are advised that due to the enhanced security measures recently implemented at the Aeronautical Center, access to the center is limited and hand delivery of responses will be permitted under FAA escort only.  Overnight delivery of responses to this RFI could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for special mail handling procedures now in place at the Aeronautical Center. This RFI is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of requested technical documentation. Inquiries regarding this RFI should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Connie M. Houpt,  (405) 954-7820.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer vendor questions and extend the closing date for the submission of quotations to 24 March 2004.  The original synopsis/RFQ was posted to the FEDBIZOPPS on 3 March 2004.  
Q1)  For exact shipping cost where would be the place of performance? We'd love to give you an accurate quote.  A1)  As it states in the RFQ, the ship to address is NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, China Lake, CA 93555. 
Q2)  Is there any other technical or commercial information available please?  A2) The only information that is available is the Synopsis/RFQ on the FedBizOps website. 
Q3)  I understand that there is only one delivery destination but I would like to know what is the total quantity for that bid so I can properly calculate.  A3)  CLIN 0001, 8-channel video recording system, has a quantity of 1 and CLIN 0002, 4-channel video recording system, has a quantity of 2.
Q4)  Listed in the requirements is the need to have a removable hard drive; however, I was seeking to learn if our solutions that provides for internal back and external back to up to 2.T would that be acceptable.  Also, please provide the total required disk space needed on the hard drive, and how many hours/days will be required to be stored, without the need to backup.  A4)  The removable hard drive is the drive that stores the video data.  The requirement is for tests that have classified data.  The drive should be able to store eight channels of composite video data for approximately 10 minutes. 
Q5)  If the drive needs to be removed - would the technical team prefer a DVR that can be mobile – used in EMS/and squad cars? However, it would not be rack mountable; it could other wise place of rack shelves.  Also, just to ensure that I understand – the drive must be a removable drive correct?  A5)  These units will be mounted in 19" equipment racks so they do not need to be mobile.  We have plenty of rack space.  The data drive needs to be removable so it can be placed in a safe overnight.  The data drive will be used to store data until it can be transferred to DVD for our customers (no proprietary software needed).
Q6)  Is there a requirement to record RGB data streams at up to 1600 x 1200 resolution?  
A6)  Not at this time.  We need to record composite video.  These units will be used to replace our existing SVHS tape recorders.  In the future the end instrument may be an actual digital video camera.
Q7)  1)  You specificed 2 audio channels on the 8 channel systems.   How many audio channels are required on each of the 4 channels recorders?  2)  How many frames per minute (fps) is required for each video channel?  Prices increase with increased fps rates.   Frame rates vary between 7 to 30 fps, depending upon requirements.  3)  What is the maximum number of hours of recorded video/audio required on the removable hard drive?  4)  Do you require redundant hard drive backup, in addition to that recorded on the removable drive? A7)  1)  2 Audio channels are required on the 4 channel systems also.  2)  This is composite video - 30 frames/second.  3)  Highest resolution for a minimum of ten minutes.  Need to have the ability to increase time up to two hours of recording with decreased resolution.  4)  A redundant drive is not required.  If the system goes bad we still lose data.  True redundancy would require a second system powered from a different source.  If this is needed we could integrate one of the four channel systems.
Q8)  
Video Resolution and bit rate
1. Currently we enable Half d1 or full D1 video display resolutions - Does it fit the requirements?
2. What is the expected average bit-rate of the video streams?
Video Compression and multiplexing
1. We provide MPEG-2 based solutions for video compression - Does it
fit the customer's requirements? If not what compression format should be used?
2. What is the expected multiplexing type of the compressed video streams:
** Should it be a transport stream based multiplexing? If so, should the multiplexed stream contain all the video and audio streams or is it that a transport stream should be created per combination of video and audio stream?
** Should the different video channels be multiplexed into separate program streams?
One should take into account that multiplexed transport streams have to be demultiplexed using specific software in order for the user to work with the video.
Recording (media) Volume
1. What is the expected recording length?
2. What is the required volume of the recording media?
DVD - Creation, Distribution and replaying
1. Should the system simply enable burning data into a recordable DVD media (hence copying the compressed video files into the DVD), or should it create standard DVD formatted disks that could be played on a standard commercial DVD player?
Video and Audio transmission over the Ethernet
1. It is not clear whether the system should support video files copying and manipulation via the Ethernet? Or is that system shall have the ability to do streaming of video and audio data over Ethernet ?
A8)  
1) Video resolution - Half and full D1 are acceptable - Composite Video @ 30 fps.
2) Video compression and multiplexing - MPEG-2 format - Vendor to propose recommendations.
3) Recording Volume - 10 Minutes minimum @ highest resolution - able to record for 2 hours at decreased resolution.
4) Ability to record DVD's that can be played on computer or commercial DVD player without need for propprietary software.
5) Video/audio transmission over ethernet - System will have the capability to provide dialup for multiple users into our system to view and replay video/audio data.
Q9)  
1) For the video inputs what image resolution is required?  For example: 320 X 240? 
2) For the video inputs how many frames per second per input channel are required to be recorded? 
3) For the video inputs how many bits per pixel are required? 
4) What is the video source, such as what model camera is being used? 
5) What is the required duration for record time?
A9)  
1)  D1, half D1, or SIF.
2)  30 fps/channel on all systems, all frames/ all channels.
3)  24 bit color.
4)  There are several types of CCD cameras in the field - all provide composite video out (NTSC).
5)  The minimum time with maximum resolution is 10 minutes,  2 hours with decreased resolution.

<DESC>This synopsis supersedes the synopsis posted on March 12, 2004.  A capability statement is not being requested. The release of the final RFP SP3100-04-R-0002 for the physical distribution and warehouse operations to support Defense Distribution Depot Guam Marianas (DDGM) in the Territory of Guam is anticipated to be posted to FedBizOps, www.eps.gov,  NLT 30 March 2004 with a 30 day response time.  Offers will be accepted from all responsible firms, regardless of business size.  However, eligibility for award will be based upon a cascading order of preference.  The Government intends to award a Time and Materials Contract  for a base plus four option periods on a competitive basis to an eligible business concern included in one of the following two (2) cascading  preference tiers provided that adequate competition is received and award can be made at a fair market price (see definition at FAR Part 19).  Adequate competition is defined as: receipt of at  least two proposals in a tier from companies that are qualified.  Evaluation preference is to be applied in the following manner:  First Tier Competition:  This Tier is defined by competition among eligible small business concerns providing more than 50% of the direct contract dollars proposed for the required contract effort.  In the event that competition and price requirements cannot be met under the First Tier Competition, and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then competition for this Tier will stop.  However, the one qualified firm from this Tier will become eligible to compete in the Second Tier Competition.  Second Tier Competition: This Tier is defined as an unrestricted, full and open competition with an awaradee based upon a best value determination pursuant to FAR Part 15.3.   The government reserves the right to cancel this acquisition at anytime. The government is not responsible for any costs incurred in order to participate in this acquisition process. All information submitted is at the offeror's own expense. Points of contact are Ruth Maggs at ruth.maggs@dla.mil or Renee Cairo-Iocco at renee.cairo-iocco@dla.mil.

E. Introduction and Background

The United States-Asia Environmental Partnership (US-AEP) is a regional program established in 1992 by a presidential initiative and led by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). US-AEP promotes environmentally sustainable growth and improved quality of life in six Asian countries - India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam.  The program is based on the premise that environmental problems in Asia can best be solved and sustainable growth achieved through the formation of long-term linkages between Asian and US government, NGO and business decision makers.  It has been successful in mobilizing US expertise and using it effectively to address the environmental problems associated with the rapid urbanization and industrialization of Asia.

US-AEP’s strategic objective is cleaner cities and industries in Asia, and it focuses on the following result areas:

•	Improved policy and governance
•	Improved urban environmental management 
•	Improved industrial environmental management 

Activities conducted by US-AEP often draw on a wide range of resources:  grant programs, short-term technical assistance (STTA), exchange resources, and contractor support.  All US-AEP activities are designed to foster the development of long-term relationships that are intended to continue beyond the period of US-AEP’s funding.  US-AEP typically requires cost-sharing from its partners – an approach that has been highly effective.  

US-AEP collaborates closely with other U.S. government agencies, as well as with other international development organizations.  These interagency partnerships also allow US-AEP to leverage scarce resources to increase its impact on environmental problems in the region.  In FY 2004 US-AEP will be building on its existing strong relationship with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and strengthening new relationships with the Department of Energy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  US-AEP also partners with leading U.S. state and municipal entities to demonstrate environmental management best practices that can be applied by Asian urban centers.  In addition, US-AEP will continue to work with international development organizations, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, to implement activities of common interest.  

Beginning in FY 2004, management responsibility for US-AEP has been transferred from USAID headquarters in Washington, DC to USAID’s new Regional Development Mission for Asia (based in Bangkok).  This action supports US-AEP’s strategy to be more field-driven, with much of the work-planning process devolved to country teams, where knowledge of environmental problems and opportunities is greatest.  Both the US-AEP Regional Director and the country team for Thailand will be based at the RDMA in Bangkok.  The country team for Thailand will consist of a Country Manager and a Development Specialist.  The Regional Director will coordinate the activities of the six country teams and manage regional programs.  

With an overall goal of being a valued partner in helping Thailand to manage the environmental challenges inherent in increased urban and industrial growth, US-AEP has been active in Thailand for more than ten years. During this time US-AEP has supported exchange visits and study tours of more than one thousand Thais to the US and worked with most of the organizations central to environmental development in Thailand. Currently US-AEP has strong project activities in almost all aspects of urban and industrial environmental development in the country.  Highlights of US-AEP accomplishments include the following:

•	A rich and influential Public Policy program that includes working directly with the Thai Senate, Council of State, the Courts of Justice, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE).  Recent accomplishments include a national law on public consultation; environmental dispute prevention and resolution center; and an environmental or “green” bench in Thailand’s Supreme Court to hear environmental cases. 
•	A community-based approach to restore water quality in the Tha Chin River that involves Tha Chin River agencies and organizations and counterparts from the Chesapeake Bay in the U.S. and Laguna de Bay in the Philippines.   A recent accomplishment in 2004 is the signing of the Tha Chin River Basin Partnership to cooperate in reducing pollution, provide information to the public, and involve NGOs and the public in the process.  NGO leaders subsequently signed a similar pact to work together in support of this agreement. MoNRE’s Pollution Control Department plans to use the success of this project as a model for 15 other river basins in Thailand.
•	A net metering project to promote renewable energy generation that supports small and medium-sized generators of wind, solar, biomass and biogas energy to connect to the power grid.  Recent accomplishments include remedies that address technical and administrative barriers to net metering, assistance to the first community in Thailand to connect to the power grid, and support to a biogas company to provide three megawatts (MW) worth of production to the Provincial Electrical Authority grid.

The FY04 US-AEP Work Plan for Thailand continues to build on existing program initiatives such as those mentioned above and others that reduce diesel emissions in Bangkok, improve municipal environmental management practices and promote cleaner production practices.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a Sole Source contract, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 with Aeronix, Inc., 1775 West Hibiscus Boulevard, Suite 304, Melbourne, FL 32901.  Aeronix is the only known source that can wholly satisfy the given requirements and meet the immediate needs of ongoing and anticipated tasking.  To the Government knowledge no other qualified contractor which can provide a service that offers the unique knowledge and expertise Aeronix has developed through its OE SCA development support role and JTAP software development services performed for the JTRS JPO exists.  Aeronix was the originator of the concept and design, and sole developer of JTAP.  The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is the family of Department of Defense software-defined radios that will be the foundation of information radio frequency transmission for Joint Vision (JV2020). JTRS will eventually replace all existing tactical radios in accordance with the Service?s migration plans and introduce new capabilities to the warfighter in support of future battlefield concepts. The JTRS will be designed as a family of advanced, reliable, dynamic communications platforms. These communications platforms will be software re-programmable, multi-mode, network-centric, and provide simultaneous voice, data, and video communications. The JTRS Program is built around a common, open Software Communications Architecture (SCA) that allows common software waveform applications to be implemented once, and ?ported? throughout the family of JTRS radios. The JTRS open system architecture will enable portability of the common software waveform implementations across all Joint Tactical Radio (JTR) systems. This open architecture and common software waveform implementations will be an enabler of joint interoperability. It will also enable technology insertion through evolutionary acquisition and preplanned product improvement. It is the SCA that assures portability of common, standardized waveforms to different hardware sets, thereby achieving considerable cost savings over traditional acquisition strategies of the past. This approach assures interoperability of the family of radios to be deployed as well as interoperability with legacy radios using the same waveforms. Compliance with the SCA must be verified in order to assure proper implementation and afford the benefits of portability and joint interoperability.  The JTRS Joint Program Office (JPO) has employed a government laboratory test team to perform the architecture verification. This test team and their test facility are called the JTRS Technology Laboratory (JTeL).  The JTeL is lead and managed by SPAWAR Systems Centers Charleston and San Diego.  JTRS architecture compliance verification occurs on developed waveforms in the areas of waveform performance, information assurance, portability, and the SCA.  JTRS architecture compliance verification also occurs on JTR Sets within the Operating Environment?s (OE) core framework, operating system (OS), and CORBA. The JTRS Test Application (JTAP) is a software tool used by the JTeL in order to test vendor-produced waveforms for SCA compliance.  As JTRS evolves, so does the SCA and the SCA OE, forcing JTAP to remain up to date with the latest changes to the SCA that are applicable to JTRS, while remaining as bug-free as possible. This Statement of Work (SOW) describes the tasks to be performed in support of the JTeL. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract is anticipated with a base period of one year options to extend the term of the contract for an additional four (4) one-year periods.  The NAICS Code is 541330 and the applicable size standard is $23 Million.  NO SOLICITATION WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the individual identified below.  Supporting evidence to include appropriate documentation, literature and references must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the high level of proficiency required to comply with the above requirements.  This documenttion shall include:  contract numbers, contract types, dollar value for each contract referenced, summary of work performed as well as a customer point of contact, including phone number, for relevant work performed during the past five years that substantiates the ability to meet the requirements outlined in the Draft SOW.  The data submitted shall be limited to no more than five (5) pages. Comments and/or responses shall be submitted via e-mail to SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, Code 0215DS, Denise Simmons at:  denise.simmons@navy.mil.  Any response to this announcement must be received no later than 14:00 EST 23 March 2004.  All responses will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed action is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Army Field Support Command is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources that are capable of manufacturing the Firing Device Multipurpose M142.  The technical description of the item is identified as: Firing Device Multipurpose M142 , NSN 1375-01-040-1526, DODAC 1375-ML03, P/N 9296865.  More information can be requested from Norma Webb-Green, Contract Specialist, (309) 782-8605. email norma.webbgreen@us.army.mil  The basic component of the M142 Firing Device is a mechanical switch des igned for mechanical actuation (to initiate the explosive) by pressure, pull, pressure release or tension release.  In addition to its four-mode capability, the M142 can be used to ignite either a blasting cap (as in other firing devices) or time blasting fuse for setting a short delay type booby trap.  The M142 is weather-sealed and will function under water. The firing device consists of a number of different components to facilitate operation in four modes.  The components, which make up the M142, are: T he switch that incorporates two pivot pins, a sear plate, a spring and a firing pin.  A safety pin is also incorporated in the switch to prevent accidental initiation.  It is positioned in front of the firing pin and is only removed after the desired opera ting mode is set up. A tripwire Ã¢Â€Â“ 50 feet of copper wire wound on a cardboard spool.  An olive drab coat of paint over the wire prevents it from accidentally unwinding and aids concealment.  It is used in the tension release mode and in the pull mode.  A tension release attachment of specially formed stainless steel wire that has a spring type action.  In the tension release mode, the attachment holds the tripwire under tension that, in turn, maintains the firing device in a constantly armed position. Actuation is initiated when the taut tripwire is cut which permits the sear plate to release the firing pin. A coupling body Ã¢Â€Â“ a cylindrical plastic assembly that contains the explosive initiating element, an M42 primer, but no blasting cap.(The user installs the cap.)  An instruction sheet giving abbreviated setup instructions is provided with each device.  Fasteners Ã¢Â€Â“ a set of nails and screws for securing the switch are included with each device.  The olive drab plastic switch and coupling body  are unpainted.  They are unmarked except for a yellow band painted on the coupling body.  The brass safety pin and steel pivot pins are unpainted. The M142 Firing Device components, including the instruction sheet, screws and nails are packed in a cylindr ical metal container 3-1/8 inches in diameter and 1-1/4 inches high.  Fifty-six containers are packed in four M19A1 ammunition boxes (14 per box) which are in turn packed in a wire bound box.  A respondent to this market survey should demonstrate technical  and manufacturing capacity as well as a good past performance record in the explosive processing industry. Respondents should specify the skills and facilities required for the manufacture of the M142 Firing Device.  In the event that a respondent does no t have adequate resources, the respondent must document the ability to obtain the required resources in a timely fashion.

<SUBJECT>Integrated Installation Information Architecture
<DESC>Future Business Opportunity Announcement Statement of Requirement: Commander, Navy Installations (CNI) has a requirement for services to support the assessment, analysis, and planning associated with the development of an Integrated Installation Information Architecture (I3A) for the Navy-wide shore installation infrastructure. Background: CNI was established in October 2003 with a clear mandate to enhance the effectiveness of shore installation management.  The current CNI business environment is comprised of nine major business areas which are further divided into 32 sub-functional areas, each with its own set of applications and data sources.  CNI is working to significantly reduce the number of its applications and associated data sources and servers.  Other major CNI and Navy initiatives are already underway that are impacting the CNI IT environment.  CNI desires to take immediate action to develop a vision for a viable I3A end state in order to ensure that, as the CNI IT environment continues to evolve, all efforts are effectively aligned. CNI Vision: CNI?s future IT architecture (I3A) will support a robust decision support capability.  It will be expected that the I3A enable the transformation of integrated data into management information, provide data accessibility and situational awareness within and across functional areas, and support improvements in business processes by making available output-driven metrics via a significantly reduced number of standard applications.  The foundation of the I3A will be an effective and efficient integration of the NMCI network with the ?to-be? CNI infrastructure. Major objectives of I3A related initiatives include, but are not limited to: 1) standardization of applications to support establishment of common business practices; 2) alignment with Federal/DOD/Navy IT initiatives, mandates, and guidelines; 3) reduction of IT infrastructure costs and the CNI total cost of managing and operating Navy shore installations; 4) enhancement of management decision support systems; and 5) establishment of authoritative data sources. The I3A initiative will be a carefully planned and phased multi-year effort. Business Opportunity: CNI requires industry expertise in the areas of IT architecture, application rationalization, server consolidation, enterprise application and sensor integration to support the transformation of CNI?s ?as-is? environment into a more effective, efficient, and integrated enterprise IT infrastructure (?to-be?).  This business opportunity is a first step.  Contractor support will be required to: 1) conduct an analysis and assessment of the ?as-is? CNI IT environment in order to create an understanding of the relationship between business processes, applications, and organizations; 2) build on this understanding to develop a framework for the ?to-be? I3A; 3) develop a high-level migration plan using ?gap analysis? or other analytical methods to describe the ?way ahead.?  The migration plan will be supported by prioritized, actionable work packages that provide sufficient information for CNI to make implementation decisions.  Specific attention to identification or development of standards or criteria for sensor integration will be required.  The contractor will also perform analysis related to server consolidation planning and develop an approach that enables CNI to initiate actions that align with evolving Navy plans.  During the performance of work, the successful bidder will be required to integrate and work with other government organizations and support contractors engaged in supporting ongoing Navy and CNI IT initiatives. Contractual Approach: The planned acquisition strategy for this initial effort will be a competition among existing GSA Schedule holders, which will result in an award of an FFP order for a six-month period of performance.  At completion and acceptance of the contract deliverables, CNI will assess the viability of the solutions offered and formulate a plan to execute the CNI I3A initiative. Pre-Solicitation Conference: To further publicize and clarify the scope of the CNI I3A initiative, a ?Pre-Solicitation? Conference will be held on Thursday, 25 March 2004, from 1000 ? 1300 at the Crystal City Hilton Hotel.  Further information concerning the CNI IT Initiative and contractual approach associated with this FBO will be presented.  Additionally, a brief presentation of the current CNI IT projects and other identified government IT initiatives which will impact the CNI I3A initiative will be provided.  A question and answer session will follow. Further detailed information on this conference will be posted on the CNI Clearinghouse website.  All prospective offerors are urged to attend this conference.  In order to make the conference as productive as possible, offerors are requested to submit any questions in writing to the Contracting Officer, Code 0215AC, Contracts Division, SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, SC, fax (843) 218-5930 or via e-mail (angela.e.carter@navy.mil) so as to arrive at least two working days prior to the conference.  Prospective offerors are requested to submit the names of the representatives who will attend the Pre-Solicitation Conference to Angela Carter (via fax or e-mail address noted above) no later than Monday, 22 March 2004.  Since space is limited, each prospective offeror is requested to send no more than 3 representatives to attend the Pre-Solicitation Conference.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information - Commercial Motor Rewind Services Involving Various Aircraft Motor Assemblies
<DESC>Request for Information.  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport is conducting market research to determine the interest and capability of industry for commercial motor rewind services involving various aircraft motor assemblies that may range from 1/20 hp to 10 hp.  The motors may vary, from DC generators to multi-speed AC synchronous motors performing various functions.  Motor functional elements that may require analysis and servicing include, but are not limited to actuator drive systems, electric hydraulic pump assemblies, and winches.  The scope of services that may be required includes disassembly and reverse engineering of existing motor rewind components, resulting in an industry standard data package detailing unique materials and process requirements for motor rewind.  This data package would then be incorporated into military level technical repair standar ds for the government depots.  In order to determine corporate capability or interest, motors may be shipped or made available for viewing or disassembly.  Due to the unique nature of these services, and the possible difficulty in determining technical capability, the Government may, upon initially determining a high potential for capability, verbally solicit and issue one-time small purchase orders not exceeding $25,000 among those vendors demonstrating an interest and initial capability for a  rewind or reverse engineering effort.  The Small Business Act and its provisions would apply under such circumstance.  The Government does not otherwise intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement for technical information provided as a result of this synopsis.  All packages submitted in response to the Request for Information (RFI) should include the following information :  Name and address of company, business size, company point of contact, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, statement of capability, and estimated cost.  The capability package must be clear, and concise.  Capability packages must be received no later than 3:00 P.M. PST, 16 April 2004.  The Government is interested in obtaining information from industry to identify capability for highly specialized rewind services of aircraft motor assemblies.  The information provided through the responses will be used to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) web link www.neco.navy.mil.

Meeting place is the Poe Conference Center (Large Conference Rm), 6058 Aspen Ave, Hill AFB, UT, 84056,.  The conference is scheduled between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM.  The 11th is reserved for one-on-one discussions beginning at 8:00 AM and ending at approximately 4:00 PM, also at the Poe Conference Center.  One-on-one sessions will be limited to 15-minute blocks.  

Seats for the conference on the 10th and one-on-one meetings on the 11th will be assigned on a first come bases.  Unless requested differently, the earliest respondents will be assigned the earliest meeting times on the 11th.  Because our venue will only permit 100 people to attend, we request that representatives be limited to two per company.  If you would like to send more than two representatives, please let us know and if space is available we will notify you.  If we do not hear from you by 2 Dec 2003 we will permit more than two representatives per company to attend.

There will be a $10 conference fee for each attendee.  Request the fee be paid at the time of registration on the 10th.

The purpose of this interactive Industry Day is to identify Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) best practices for Federal Stock Classes 1620, 1630 and 2620, which encompass Landing Gear, Wheel, Brakes and Tires (LWBT) for a variety of Air Force managed aircraft.  A LWBT Commodity Council has been formed, and will be pursuing the development of an AFMC enterprise sourcing strategy, which could result in contractual documents for new purchases and repairs for FSC’s 1620, 1630 and 2620 items managed by the USAF.

The intent of the conference on the 10th is to introduce interested contractors to PSCM concepts, discuss current obstacles and impediments to doing business from both industry and government perspectives, and to discuss specific corrective solutions.  Those who are interested in attending this conference should Email Stephen Weiss at mailto:stephen.weiss@hill.af.mil.  Please provide the name(s) of the party attending.  The name(s) will be used to permit access to the base and entry to the conference.  Once your request to attend has been received, additional information will be provided to you.  If interested, a one-on-one meeting time may also be requested on the 11th to discuss specific issues of concern or recommendations.

Several considerations that may affect current or potential suppliers are potential new source qualification procedures, development of multiple-award contracts to cover many requirements within 1620 and 1630 FSC’s, and streamlined solicitation procedures.

The Industry Day format will include a government overview of PSCM, current obstacles and impediments, PSCM solutions being considered, and a open discussion / general question and answer session.  It is our objective to understand how we can improve all aspects of our Landing Gear, Wheel, Brake and Tire business.

This is an advertisement for Industry Days only and no solicitation is available at this time. Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement. The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any contract associated with this event.  Information is provided for discussion purposes only.  Any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to solicitation release.

Time: 8:30AM – 2:00PM

PUBLIC BUILDING SERVICES (PBS)


This training is recommended for both large and small businesses wanting to sell to the Federal government.  If you provide products and services, which you would like to sell to the Federal Government, this session will help you secure work with GSA and other Federal agencies.  It is an excellent way to get your foot in the door of Federal agencies and learn to understand the preferred method of procurement for Department of Defense activities and the civilian agencies.

If your organizations can provide any of the following services to the Federal Government, you should attend the PBS session:

Design and Construction

If your organization provides professional architects, engineers, or you are able to design, renovate, and construct new and existing properties.

Real Estate Services

If you provide related real estate services including the operation and maintenance of buildings, security, and out leasing programs.  GSA’s Computer Integrated Facility Management program uses cutting-edge technology to look at a building’s life cycle.  Real estate services provided to clients appear in federal agencies’ monthly electronic rent bills. GSA has simplified these bills so agencies have a clearer understanding of the costs charged for being housed in federal space. 

Federal Protective Service
If your organization provides security services that promote a safe environment in which Federal agencies can conduct their business.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent
<DESC>Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is planning to issue a short term (less than 6 months) sole-source contract to ensure the continuity of courier services for the Center for Federal Investigative Services (CFIS) and the Center for Retirement and Insurance Services (CRIS) co-located in Boyers, PA and the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  The current vendor, VGA Enterprises 14625 Baltimore Ave., Suite 228, Laurel, MD, 20707, is the only responsible source at this time that has personnel qualified to carry out the courier service to the CFIS and CRIS locations due to the background investigation requirements imposed under 5CFR 731 and 736 with a sensitivity designation level of Critical Sensitive.  It is not reasonably possible to clear new vendor personnel by the expiration date of the existing contract; the time period it takes to clear personnel with the sensitivity designation of Critical Sensitive is 35 days or more.  It is critical to the CFIS and CRIS missions that the courier service is maintained without delay during the acquisition process to implement a long term courier solution.  Therefore, VGA Enterprises is the intended source for this short term requirement.  The anticipated contract action for this service is not anticipated to be greater than $100,000.
OPM deems it appropriate to award a fixed-price contract on other 	than a full and open competitive basis.  Only one responsible source is available and no other types of 	services will satisfy the needs of the Agency.  The North American Standard Industrial 	Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 492110, Couriers.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  All interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement may submit in writing a substantive statement specifying their ability to meet this requirement to be received within 15 days of publication of this Notice to: U. S.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional informational included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The government anticipates making a sole source award, however any source that can meet this requirement may respond.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-15.  The NAICS Code is 511210.  Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) intends to contract on a sole source basis to Realization Technologies Inc. for a 5 month pilot demonstration of their Concerto software supporting a Theory of Constraints Project Management (TOC PM) implementation in a multi-project environment.  This contract will include software use, training, and implementation support for the pilot organization.  If the pilot implementation is successful, AFOTEC intends to purchase the Concerto software, training, and implementation support for the rest of the organization.  After functional evaluation of existing software packages that support TOC PM, AFOTEC has determined that Concerto is the only product on the market that meets the requirements.  Concerto has several capabilities that allow it to support a multi-project implementation of TOC PM with a focus on improving resource utilization and throughput of the organization.  The key capabilities provided by Concerto include web access, which provides configuration control of project plans and real-time access to all key decision makers in the organization.  Concerto has a buffer management algorithm that establishes task level priorities based on buffer penetration.   This capability sets clear priorities for tasks thereby reducing multitasking so that resources can be effectively and efficiently shared across projects.  Concerto also provides project to project links and subproject capabilities that provide visibility of activities and commitment dates at the program, project and subproject level, serving the needs of leadership at all levels.  Finally, Concerto simplifies project planning and optimization, and provides compatibility with other users in the DoD acquisition community.

<DESC>Over the past six years, the Foreign Service Institute School of Professional Area Studies (SPAS) has made incremental changes and improvements in its efforts to administer and evaluate courses. These efforts encompass before-training needs assessment, as well as evaluation surveys conducted during training, after training, and as long-term follow up to training, plus measurement of customer satisfaction. Additional technical assistance is needed to take these efforts to the next level and integrate them with existing computer and online systems that benefit the SPAS School, as well as FSI in general. 

The School of Professional and Area Studies (SPAS) of FSI is seeking a contractor to develop an Information Technology Investment Portfolio System (I-TIPS) proposal to obtain funding for the proposed course evaluation and student survey system; to convert SPAS course survey and evaluation instruments to a web-enabled format, and to a scanner-enabled format where web access is not possible; to offer assistance to course managers for creating CD-ROMS and other electronic support materials for students of particular courses; to offer support to SPAS divisions in applying web-based tools and templates to administer course logistics, linked to FSI Learning Management System database applications for tracking course-related information; to expand the CSD and SPAS Intranet sites into a more robust tool for use by SPAS education specialists, instructors and course managers; and provide support to the SPAS division staff on developing other division-specific course support materials and tools.

The subject solicitation listed several training objectives to be accomplished in a five-day period.  Some of the training objectives mentioned cover a wide range of possibilities.  The following questions are provided to assist us in developing a five-day curriculum that will best meet your POI requirements.  QUESTION 6.a.  The training objective stating “less than lethal training”; this could cover anything from pepper spray and baton training to 40mm less lethal munitions.  What would be the less lethal weapon for this training?  ANSWER 6.a. Baton training specifically, but pepper spray, taser, or 40mm less than lethal munitions would be beneficial.  QUESTION 6.b.  During the off road driving / limited visibility training will the student be utilizing a government furnished organic vehicle such as the Hummer or is the contractor required to provide the off road vehicle?  ANSWER 6.b. The contractor shall provide off-road vehicles (SUVs and ATVs).   QUESTION 6.c.

Students shall learn to regain control of their vehicle and drive away from the attacker unharmed.  QUESTION 6.e.  What type of vehicle will be used for the ATV training?  ANSWER 6.e. Four-Wheeled all terrain vehicle.  QUESTION 7.  Regarding Solicitation # H92239-04-T-0014, if we were to suggest using a facility in the Laughlin, NV/Bullhead City, AZ area, would you be able to provide accommodations for your training participants there, or should that be included in the quotation price?  The Las Vegas airport is approximately 100 miles from this location, and there is an Air National Guard location nearby.  In any case, are travel, accommodations and meal expenses for training participants to be included in our price?   ANSWER 7. The government will be provide travel, accommodations and meal expenses for government training participants.  Recommendations for lodging in the training area will be of great assistance.  QUESTION 8.  Has this training, or other training, been accomplished by subcontractors (i.e. awarded via solicitation) in the past?  If so, have the U.S. Special Operations Command personnel traveled outside of North Carolina in order to achieve training?  Would travel to the southwestern United States be seen as an undue hardship for this training?  ANSWER 8. Similar training has been conducted outside of North Carolina.  The proposed location will be evaluated and the cost to the Government for travel will be considered in the best value determination.  QUESTION 9.  Will the students be bringing their own weapons, helmets, body armor, ammunition (inc. Simunition), NOD's, explosives.  ANSWER 9.

However, it is the contractor’s responsibility to provide all ammunition/simunitions/pyrotechnics required to conduct the training.  QUESTION 10.

The contractor shall provide off-road vehicles (SUVs) and four-wheeled all terrain vehicles (ATVs).   QUESTION 11.  Is training also required in a right hand car?  ANSWER 11.
