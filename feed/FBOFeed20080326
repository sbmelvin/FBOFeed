<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT IS COMPETING EXISTING LEASED LOCATION

The General Services Administration (GSA) currently is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate.  In making this decision, GSA will consider, among other things, the costs it would likely incur through relocation, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements, telecommunications infrastructure costs, non-productive agency downtime, security and other appropriate considerations. 

GSA currently leases 29,367 BOMA rentable square feet of office space with 160 on-site parking spaces in St. Michaels, AZ.  This lease is expiring February 2, 2009 requiring occupancy date by February 3, 2009.  GSA has interest in leasing a minimum of 29,367 to a maximum of 32,891BOMA rentable square feet of contiguous office space with 160 on-site parking spaces, in St. Michaels, Arizona.  Rentable space must yield a minimum of 29,367 usable square feet.  Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety; seismic; accessibility; security; and must not be located within a 100-year floodplain.  At minimum, the requirements listed above must be met to be considered as a possible alternative space. 

LEASE TERM:   Ten (10) years, five (5) years firm 

OCCUPANCY:  Space must be ready by February 3, 2009. 

Expressions of interest must arrive at the following address by 4:00 p.m. on April 9, 2008:

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is the division under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that is responsible for the operation of the Medicare fee-for-service, managed care, and drug benefit programs, the Medicaid program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), as well as other related programs.  The CMS programs are directed and overseen by a federal employee staff of less than 5,000, which is relatively small compared to the CMS program budgets.  
CMS has many projects based on writing policy, providing guidance, and monitoring quality standards.  The number of priority operational initiatives and projects continues to grow, and CMS is challenged with completing more projects with less time and limited resources.  In addition, there is increasing demand for high priority projects and initiatives to support CMS and HHS priorities and the President's Management Agenda.
In order for the organization to continue to play a key role in the overall direction of the health care system we need to be able to insure our partnerships with academic public health programs.  Succession planning has become more and more important.  By partnering with graduate schools in public health we will be able to help strengthen public health education and the public health profession. 

The contractor must be able to qualify recent (graduated less than five years ago) graduates of a Masters or Doctorate program from accredited schools that offer graduate degrees in public health related fields and provide CMS with Fellows who can develop projects with an understanding of CMS' mission.  These Fellows who have met stringent requirements will be able to bring new ideas and support our mission with special projects and studies for a two year period.

CMS intends to award a single Firm Fixed Price contract for the subject need in accordance with the terms and conditions of the requirement. This is anticipated to be a 24 month completion effort effective from the date of award.  
	
This is a Pre-solicitation notice only and not a solicitation or request for proposal (RFP) document. Quotes are not being accepted at this time. Contractors should follow the instructions below. Please be advised that this Pre-solicitation notice does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a quotation.  In addition, the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this procurement. 

It is anticipated the solicitation document will be available for downloading from FedBizOpps on or about April 10, 2008 at http://www.fbo.gov/. CMS anticipates making award by June 30, 2008. The North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) is 611710 and the size standard is $6.5M to classify as a small business.  This is an unrestricted procurement and will be available for both small and large businesses.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Sources must have valid Cage Codes and DUNs Numbers or have the ability to obtain one, also be registered in CCR www.ccr.gov (Central Contractors Registration) and ORCA https://orca.bpn.gov (Online Representations and Certifications Application).

<RESPDATE>011409
<CONTACT>John  Zolper, DARPA Program Manager, MTO, Phone 0000000000, Fax 7036962206, Email none
<DESC>1. INTRODUCTION
The Microsystems Technology Office?s (MTO) mission is to exploit breakthroughs in materials, devices, circuits, and mathematics to develop beyond leading edge Microsystems components with revolutionary performance and functionality to enable new platform capability for the Department of Defense.  To execute this mission, MTO supports revolutionary research in electronics, photonics, MEMS, algorithms, and combined Microsystems technology to deliver new capabilities to sense, communicate, energize, actuate, and process data and information for the war fighter. 

1.1 TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS
MTO regularly publishes Broad Agency Announcements requesting responses to specific program topics.  This announcement seeks revolutionary research ideas for topics not being addressed by ongoing MTO programs or other published BAA solicitations. This BAA is primarily, but not solely, intended for early stage research that will lead to larger, focused, MTO programs in the future.  Potential bidders are highly encouraged to review the current MTO programs listed on the MTO website at: http://www.darpa.mil/mto/radprograms.html and other MTO solicitations list at: http://www.darpa.mil/mto/solicitations/index.html to avoid proposing efforts to this BAA that duplicate existing activities or that are responsive to other published MTO BAA?s.  Contacting MTO program managers to discuss research interests is also encouraged.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

Research areas of current interest in MTO, include, but are not limited to:
1.Low power, high performance digital and analog data processing
2.Novel electronic and photonic device  demonstrations
3.Novel semiconductor materials enabling new device concepts or capabilities
4.Nanophotonics and nanoelectronic device and circuit demonstrations
5.Power Electronics
6.RF technology
7.Biological and chemical sensors
8.Quantum information science and technology
9.Chip scale navigation, timing, and control
10.Three dimensional digital, rf, and imaging technologies
11.Integrated chip-scale photonics
12.Micro-scale power generation, control, and conversion
13.Infrared and ultraviolet detectors and imagers
14.Terahertz technology
15.Optical communication technology
16.Analog-to-digital conversion
17.Co-optimization of hardware and algorithms
18.Novel complex circuit design technology
19.Trusted design and hardware technology
20.Microsystems addressing challenges in complex systems architectures
21.Scaling of macro-systems to micro and nano-scale
22.Micro and NanoElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS and NEMS)

2. PROPOSAL EVALUATION
The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are described in the following paragraphs.  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select offers under this BAA are, in order of descending importance: (a) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit; (b) Proposer?s Capabilities and/or Related Experience; (c) Realism of Proposed Schedule. (d) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; (e) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition; and (f) Cost Reasonableness and Realism; each proposal will be evaluated on its own merit and relevance rather than against other proposals in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.  Proposals may be evaluated as they are received, or they may be collected and periodically reviewed.  

Details regarding the white paper and proposal preparation and submission, and other administrative details, are found in the attached Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).

<DESC>FDA seeks to continue to access drug utilization data in an outpatient setting at the national level in the US. The ability of FDA to respond expeditiously to the increasing number of postmarketing issues is of paramount importance to the overall public safety.  Continued access to these data complement and strengthen the utility of the passive reporting system currently in place by providing estimates of the numbers of patients exposed to drugs and the numbers of prescriptions dispensed nationwide in the outpatient setting.  These data provide a denominator, or context, for understanding adverse event reports; for modeling drug risk based on usage patterns; and for calculating patient-based reporting rates for drugs used in the outpatient setting.  Access to these data also increase the FDA's ability to perform regulatory impact studies; in particular, those studies that assess the impact of risk managements plans and labeling changes on prescribing habits and usage patterns for prescription drugs.  Finally, direct access to these data in real time enhances and accelerates the pace of FDA's regulatory decision-making process.

The "Access to Outpatient Prescription and Patient Level Drug Utilization Data" contract would serve as a mechanism for FDA to respond expeditiously to serious public health or regulatory issues.  FDA is not interested in developing this database and expects any qualified organization to own the data as well as have the means to access and manage the data. 

The government anticipated the award of a fixed price contract with one 12-month base year and three 1-year option periods.  The contract shall also contain an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity line item for related services on a fixed price or time-and-materials basis.

All offers shall be evaluated for fair and reasonable price, technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance, delivery schedule and adherence to the applicable clauses/provisions.  Notice to Offerers:  This procurement is part of the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System RED/Yellow/Green Program.  Award will be based on the contracting officer's decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered. NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).   (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.   ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).   (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f!  irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.   (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows: 	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. 	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

NOTE: (1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee?s clearance status may suffice depending on the employee?s status within the JPAS database. (3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued. VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER. Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person?s citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form).

These requirements will be provided within the Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) Integrated Product Team located at the NAVAIRWARCENWPNSDIV, Point Mugu, California.   The period of performance for the proposed acquisition will commence upon award and will continue for a period of four years. Deliveries will be made free on board destination.  It is anticipated that the proposed contract type will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee , Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Level of Effort (LOE) with the inclusion of performance based task orders.  The total required LOE is estimated to be 376,300 hours.  Performance of the task orders issued under this contract will be evaluated with the basic contract Quality Assurance  Surveillance Plan, that identifies performance objectives, performance standards, acceptable quality level, inspection type and frequency, and remedies related to contractor performance.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather Service (NWS), Office of Science and Technology, Meteorological Development Laboratory (MDL) intends to negotiate on sole source basis, under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302 Other Than Full and Open Competition, with the Environmental Systems Research International Institute, Inc., 380 New York Street, Redlands, CA 92373-8100 to provide proprietary software for ESRI ArcGIS, ArcInfo, and ArcView.  ArcGIS is a collection of ESRI products which includes ArcInfo and ArcView as well as several extensions to the base product.  ArcInfo is the most complete system in the ArcGIS Desktop product suite and allows automation and input of multiple types of data, advanced spatial analysis, and raster processing, whereas ArcView allows for data editing and processing.  This request is to purchase 1 concurrent use (CU) license for ArcInfo, 4 CU licenses for ArcView, and 1 CU license for the Spatial Analyst extension.  The purchase of this software will include 1 full year of maintenance.  In addition to the tools and data available with the purchase of the ESRI GIS software, is the access to vast library of knowledge and support from other GIS professionals, the developers of the software, and technical support staff.  The maintenance of this software includes all performance and security service packages as well as copies of new releases of the software.  MDL?s purchase of the ESRI ArcGIS software is essential to the development and improvement of high resolution statistical guidance forecast grids, required as part of the National Digital Guidance Database.  Development and improvement of these high-resolution MOS grids is a significant milestone.  Our datasets have become too large to process by hand or quality control without mapping capabilities.  We have continued to train the work force, and are asking for additional copies of the software to accommodate the increase in MDL?s human resources devoted to the high-resolution gridded guidance efforts.  Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government?s requirement are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmation response, vendors must submit written data and documentation that reflect meeting the aforementioned requirements for CU compliance.  Period of Performance is one year from date of the award.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine  a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Affirmative responses must be received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  No telephone requests will be honored.  Award will be made under FAR Subpart 13.  See Note 22.  FAR Clauses: 52.212-4: Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items (Sept. 2005) (Reference). 52.212-5: Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Terms (Aug. 2006).  Place of Contract Performance: DOC/NOAA/NWS, Meteorological Development Lab W/OST2, 1325 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD  20910.  Attn: Iris Boon@301.713.1774.  However, interested companies may submit an affirmative response to the requirement with 15 days from the posting date of this notice to grace.e.carter-tyer@noaa.gov or fax to (301) 713-1024.

<CONTACT>Jesse Moreno jesse.moreno@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>This is a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for procurement of technical services with respect to the NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) program.  The Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGC) has been providing support to the NATO AGS program and is the sole owner of the proprietary data required to accomplish this effort.  The 851 Electronic Systems Group (851 ELSG), Electronic Systems Center (ESC) intends to issue a sole source request for proposal, followed by the award of a sole source contract to the Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, 2000 West NASA Blvd, P. O. Box 9650, Melbourne, FL 32902-9650. This contract will be awarded in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, which states the following: "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number o!  f responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." The scope of this contract is for NGC to provide insight into its proposed approach to meet the NATO AGS System requirement and simultaneously facilitating the US Government's assessment of the core capabilities resulting from a UAV-only based AGS system. BACKGROUND After various attempts by industrial consortia to satisfy NATO's military requirement for an airborne ground surveillance capability, including a proposal for a mixed fleet consisting of a manned and unmanned platform and the corresponding ground segment, NATO, in 2007, identified an alternative approach to satisfy the Major NATO Command's (MNC) "Urgent Need" for a ground surveillance capability.  This new approach is based on a single prime contract for a UAV-only fleet of eight Block 40 Global Hawks and associated ground systems.  The disbanding of the previous industrial consortium has allowed NG Integrated Systems Sector Eastern Region (NGISSER) to propose the new program.  The Government intends to release the Request for Proposal to NGC upon expiration of this announcement.  However, Contractors that believe they are capable of performing the Government requirements may identify their interests to the Government in writing.  Responses must be submitted in a Microsoft Word 2003 or higher format and should not exceed 3, one-sided, 8.5 X 11 inch pages, with the font no smaller than 10 point.  All interested sources must respond with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide the capability within fifteen (15) calendar days of this publication.  Interested firms are requested to submit a statement of qualifications, along with supporting documentation not later than 5 PM (EST) April 10, 2008 to 851ELSG/PK, 75 Vandenberg Dr., Hanscom AFB, Bedford MA 91731-2119.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any cost incurred in devel!  oping the information provided to ESC.  A final determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors to the Government. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call ESC Ombudsman, telephone number 781-377-5106.  Additional program information can be obtained from the Hanscom Electronic Resources Bulletin Board (HERBB) at www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to acquire expendable dropwindsondes for the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill AFB, FL. The AOC instruments, maintains and operates aircraft in support of a variety of meteorological and oceanographic research projects. One of the primary requirements in a variety of missions involves measuring and recording the atmospheric conditions below the aircraft.  The method used to obtain these atmospheric profiles utilizes an expendable dropwindsonde which is launched from the aircraft and then transmits meteorological data back to a radio receiver and processing system onboard the aircraft. The system used by the AOC and other U.S. Government agencies is called the Airborne Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (AVAPS). The Government intends to award a fixed-price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for a base period of twenty-four months, and three twelve-month option periods. The estimated quantity per year is 3000 each, however, there is no guarantee that this quantity will be required or ordered.  The dropwindsonde deliverables must meet the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) drawing set requirements which will be included in the solicitation. Alternate designs may be considered, however, any proposed design modifications shall include: an acceptance test procedure sufficient to verify the revised design is equivalent or improves upon the NCAR drawing set design; estimated cost to the Government to perform this design verification; and analysis of the benefit to the Government for selecting an alternate design. Best commercial practices shall be employed throughout the manufacturing process. All deliverables shall successfully pass NCAR drawing specifications prior to delivery.  The Met Sensor Module of the dropwindsonde is a key component which is proprietary to Vaisala, Inc. Alternate Met Sensor Modules or discrete sensor components shall be considered only if the Contractor produces compelling evidence that the alternate design has successfully been proven to meet or exceed the performance capabilities of the Vaisala Met Sensor Module in an equivalent application. At the option of the Government, the Government may perform a test of up to the first eight dropwindsondes delivered under a contract, and up to 10% of each production lot, for compliance with the requirements of the NCAR drawing set incorporated into the contract. The Government will supply the Contractor with a single channel ground (not airworthy) AVAPS system to assist with production testing. The Contractor shall provide all additional test equipment and standards required to validate that the production dropwindsonde meets the NCAR requirements. The Government shall supply engineering assistance including: technical information exchange related to the dropwindsonde; generation of non-disclosure agreements for exchange of proprietary information; providing a source list for all dropwindsonde components; up to three onsite visits to assist with production startup; and remote support (telephone, e-mail, etc) as required. Engineering assistance will be provided for a period not to exceed one year following contract award. The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government. This acquisition is not set-aside for small business.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
The 827 ACSG Contracting Office Tinker AFB, OK is requesting information on replacement systems for 337 KC135R/T aircraft.  

PURPOSE

The purpose of this RFI is to create a dialogue with industry.  With this notice, the 827 ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK is seeking comments from potential vendors concerning the appropriate strategy for a competitive procurement that supports the objectives of the Block 45 program.  Your comments will help refine procurement strategy.  Block 45 is considering a performance-based procurement with a single contractor solely responsible for all aspects of the modification.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.     

DESCRIPTION

Block 45 is Increment 1 to KC-135 Aircraft Extension Program (AEP) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) Develop and field required capabilities to extend KC-135 as viable weapon system through 2040.  The Block 45 modification consists of four modifications that will
enable mitigation of capability gaps anticipated due to expected airspace restrictions of Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management System (CNS/ATM), resolve mission suitability shortfalls, shortcomings in reliability, maintainability, and supportability.  Block 45 includes (1) Digital Flight Director (DFD) includes replacing Angle of Attack (AOA); (2) Radar Altimeter (RA); (3) Autopilot (AP).

Services to include research and development, technology insertion, system integration, installation, fabrication/prototyping, testing/certification, aircraft ground/flight testing support at Edwards AFB, studies/analyses, logistic support services, training and engineering support services, including re-engineering and reverse engineering, for a range of equipment.  Contractors may use commercial products or existing government inventories to provide the best value solution using processes and practices to reduce cost and schedule and performance risk and to promote future competition for design upgrades and operational support costs. 

Modification Installation effort:  At present, the Government is planning on contractor installation of the modification kits at contractor operated facilities.   A possibility does exist to have the Government install the modification kits using Government personnel at Government owned facilities.  Therefore, the Government is considering a contract structure that allows installation by the Government or contractor as an option to be unilaterally determined by the Government.  The Government is considering variable quantity pricing to allow for program funding changes.  

Businesses with the capability of providing the required services are invited to submit, on a voluntary basis, in writing, sufficient information that demonstrates their ability to fulfill this requirement, information concerning performance-based contract measurement recommendations, contract type, and any other relevant recommendations.  


RESPONSE:

The information you provide may be used by the USAF to ascertain and develop technical and programmatic acquisition approaches and/or strategies. Data obtained from this request will be considered and may be used for advanced planning, program phasing, and to define tailored technical requirements. As such, your inputs should not be restrictive or proprietary in any fashion.

<CONTACT>Rudolph Griego, CRADA Admin., Phone 505-844-7522, Fax 505-844-8011, Email rrgrieg@sandia.gov - Rudolph Griego, CRADA Admin., Phone 505-844-7522, Fax 505-844-8011, Email rrgrieg@sandia.gov
<DESC>RESPONSE NOTICE:  ALL RESPONSES MUST BE SUBMITTED TO Rudolph Griego,  CRADA Admin., Phone 505-844-7522, Fax 505-844-8011, Email rrgrieg@sandia.gov 

PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CONTACT OR SEND ANY RESPONSES TO DONALD ROSEBOROUGH, WHOSE NAME INCORRECTLY APPEARED AS THE CONTACT PERSON IN THE ORIGINAL POSTING DATED MARCH 19, 2008."

Sandia National Laboratories is seeking U.S. commercial and U. S. research participants willing to participate in the formation of a new Meshing And Geometry Innovation Collaboration. This partnership will be executed as a series of Cooperative Research And Development Agreements (CRADA).

The technical goal of this consortium is to produce the next generation software tools to facilitate model generation (i.e. meshes) for computational analyses. The model generation technology includes means to create, import, defeature and cleanup geometric CAD models from a heterogeneous CAD environment expected to persist within the DOE and DoD. It also includes the meshing, or discretization of this geometry into acceptable elements for wildly varying analyses. Both surface (quads / tris / quad-dominant) and volume (hex, tet, hybrid, boundary layer, chimera, etc.) meshing algorithms are necessary. 

The pressing technical challenges for this effort include providing analysis-centric conceptual design geometry, providing leading edge meshing tools and significantly strengthening tools to edit, cleanup and defeature legacy geometry from varied sources. The tool set will be architected to provide streamlined end-user customization, strong modular componentization and ultimately interoperability within any custom work process.

Two government agencies are forming a partnership to initiate this collaboration, by pooling resources and consolidating management of this project. The CUBIT team, from Sandia National Laboratories, who has a strong existing product and a strong technical reputation in this area will partner with the newly forming geometry and meshing team for the CREATE program, from the DoD's High Performance Computing Modernization Office (HPCMO). This partnership will include a consortium open to any U.S. commercial participants and U.S. research institutes willing to meet the criteria outlined below.

1) Commercial Vendors. Any U. S. commercial vendor who has a significant technical product focused on meshing and/or geometry related to meshing is invited to participate. The vendor must be willing to provide their product(s) in an easily integrated form into the developed whole. This should include access to source as well as compiled libraries as appropriate. Their products must be substantive (represent at least a 30 person-year effort), and deemed technically significant by the government partners. The vendor must also be willing to allow government use (all U.S. federal government agencies and all U.S. federal government contractors in support of U.S. federal government contracts) of the integrated executable free of charge, except to cover existing software licensing costs (e.g. royalties for an existing 3rd party solid modeling engine). Such existing costs are expected to be very low. In return, the commercial vendor will be able to execute a non-exclusive commercialization agreement to market the non-protected consortium developed code to non-government users. Vendor supplied code will be designated "vendor-protected" preventing acquisition by other vendors or commercial integrators, unless such companies agree between themselves.

2) Commercial Integrators. Any U. S. commercial entity interested in direct integration of the produced code into their company products and processes is invited to participate. The commercial entity must be willing to invest, via the CRADA mechanism, at least $1M per year at Sandia to support the integrated development. In turn, they will be allowed to use the product internally free of charge, except to cover existing 3rd party licensing costs (e.g. royalties for a solid modeling package). Such costs are expected to be very low. As a paying CRADA member, they will leverage existing and future government code, and also be able to direct the use of their money toward specific capabilities needed. The commercial entity and Sandia may agree to designate specific portions thus developed to be CRADA-protected for the commercial entity's internal use as provided for by the CRADA mechanism. They will also be able to negotiate a non-exclusive commercialization agreement to market the non-protected consortium developed code to non-government users. 

3) University and Research Participants. Any U. S. university or U.S. research institution that has a significant technical product focused on meshing and/or geometry related to meshing is invited to participate. The university/institution must be willing to provide their product(s) in an easily integrated form into the developed whole. Their product(s) must be substantive and viewed as technically significant by the government partners. The university/institution must be willing to allow government use (all US federal government agencies and all US federal government contractors in support of US federal government contracts) of the integrated executable free of charge. Universities/institutions are encouraged to allow vendor and commercial integrators use of the technology, but not required. In return, they will be able to leverage the extensive existing and future developments of the consortium for use within their research organizations, and to further their research agendas. It is anticipated that participation may be encouraged by the various government funding agencies sponsoring research development.

As in the past, government developed technology will continue to be available for technology transfer via an appropriate licensing agreement. Such agreements will be handled by Sandia. However, CRADA protected and vendor supplied software would not be available through licenses with Sandia.

Sandia will use objective evaluation criteria to determine which potential partners provide the greatest likelihood of success.  Sandia anticipates having to establish one or more Agreements with potential partners which may include Commercial License Agreements, Cooperative Research And Development Agreements (CRADAs), or Work For Other (WFO) Agreements.  The use of a CRADA is preferable. In the case of CRADAs, where several potential partners are identified and selected, Sandia National Laboratories may require the selected partners to enter into a Mulitpartner CRADA with Sandia.  Selected partners should be prepared and able to accept standard CRADA Terms and Conditions "AS-IS".

To express your interest in this technology transfer opportunity, please respond by mail or fax to Steve Owen by April 8, 2008 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0376, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87185-0376. Fax (505) 284-0140.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and describe the manner in which your company will enhance the likelihood of programmatic success.  This is not a federal government procurement and therefore there will be no debriefing regarding the results of Sandia?s selection process. 

Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

<DESC>BAA 07-18 Amendment 2

NOTE:  BAA07-18 Amendment 2 will remain open for 60 days after this amendment is published to allow proposers to address the specific Complex System Architectures (CSA) topic area.  Proposals responding to the CSA topic received after the 60 days may not be evaluated.

The Complex System Architectures (CSA) effort seeks to exploit how an understanding of the architecture of complex systems can be applied to benefit a broad array of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) problems and the larger US National interest.  A particular area of interest to MTO is identification of the optimal architectures needed to design complex Microsystems.  MTO would like to utilize the techniques and strategies employed by various technical disciplines (mathematics, biology, network design, systems engineering, electrical engineering, etc) in developing these architectures to create the most effective future Microsystems technologies.  Ideally a measurable system, widely applicable across all domains, would allow for future technological systems to be optimized for factors such as efficiency, power, and robustness.  
 
Engineering complicated technologies requires tradeoffs to be made in order to maximize efficiency for a given application.  These compromises often result in a system useful within a small scope and lacking in robustness.  Many natural ("non-engineered") complex systems tend to be remarkably efficient and robust, often exploiting adaptive elements to self-correct or re-optimize.  These natural systems are often highly interconnected and may be highly dependent on diverse states of the various parts of the system.  MTO is interested in identifying fundamental principles found in the architectures of natural systems and applying them to engineered Microsystems technologies.

To this end, the goal of CSA is to formalize design, development, and testing methodologies that can concurrently shorten system development cycles while increasing overall confidence and robustness of system performance.  While theoretical investigations are intended as an integral part of the CSA program, it is also expected that studies develop computer simulations and/or hardware test beds to prove out the conclusions developed in such investigations.  

This amendment solicits inputs for short-term (3-6 month, 1 to 2 man year) studies to further define the underpinnings of CSA and define opportunities for future MTO program initiatives.  Potential areas of interest include:

Ultra-low power system-on-chip design

Multi-element non-linear simulation

Robust, variation tolerant, mixed signal design/architectures

Effective multi-domain optimization strategies for complex optimized architecture designs

Reconfigurable and self-reconfiguring microsystems

Adaptive, highly resource efficient, algorithms for generalized signal analysis, organization of high-dimensional data, and context-aware information exploitation

Specifically excluded are evolutionary approaches based on conventional strategies to optimize Microsystems in these topical areas.

Proposals must highlight the applicability of the proposed work to CSA system challenges.  Advances are needed to identify quantifiable metrics for analysis of complex system behavior.  Investigations of novel CSA architectures should show the potential effectiveness to a specific problem or problems of interest to MTO.   The deliverables should be designed such that relevant study results can be shared with the CSA community to fuel discussion and help generate new ideas.  Proposals should include a clear program plan, regular milestones and metrics.  

Proposal will be evaluated as they are received with an initial funding selection anticipated  60 days after this amendment is published.

<DESC>MTO Office-Wide BAA 07-18: Amendment No. 4

DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. 07-18, Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) Office-wide BAA is hereby amended to add Advanced Photonic Switch (APS) as an additional (first round) research topic area.  With the exception of the APS-specific guidance/requirements provided by this amendment, all DARPA BAA 07-18 guidance/requirements (through Amendment No. 3) shall remain unchanged.  

The Advanced Photonic Switch effort seeks to develop advanced, high performance on-chip photonic switching devices for communications networks.  It is envisioned that these switching devices will benefit low power, high bandwidth, low latency, photonic communications networks, thereby benefiting a broad array of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) problems and the larger US National interest.

This amendment solicits inputs for on-chip photonic switching devices that are fabricated in a CMOS-compatible process and that maximize switching speed while simultaneously minimizing device power dissipation, transmission losses, area, and sensitivity to ambient temperature variations.  The basic building block 1x2 photonic switch can be a spectrally broad-band switch capable of simultaneously switching multiple, high bit-rate wavelength channels spanning, for example, the communications C-band near 1550 nm, or a wavelength-selective switch in the same spectral region.  DARPA MTO is especially interested in validated designs that can be scaled to complex MxN switches.   

In addition, DARPA MTO is interested in understanding the fundamental limits to the performance of such switches and in demonstrating switch performance approaching these fundamental limits, and also in exploring novel physical mechanisms that may extend these fundamental limits beyond our current understanding. 

Proposals of greatest interest will clearly define aggressive quantitative performance goals, for example, switching time < 1 ns, bit rate > 40 Gb/s, total power dissipation < 1 mW, area < 100 microns2, spectral bandwidth > 30 nm, and tolerance to thermal variations over plus/minus 10 C.  Component designs that achieve or exceed these goals are expected to optimize the overall performance of the photonic switch.  

Proposals must clearly define an aggressive timeline and milestones for fabricating the proposed photonic switches and experimentally validate specified performance goals.   The first phase of the effort should concentrate on demonstrating aggressive performance goals for the building block-switch that optimize the overall switch performance, and on a validated design for a complex, on-chip MxN switch for optical networks.  A period of performance of 18-months is expected for Phase 1 however, in accordance with the evaluation criteria, proposals with a more aggressive period of performance are encouraged.  An optional second phase demonstrating the complex MxN switch may also be proposed.  Proposals from individuals or small teams addressing these issues are encouraged.   Proposed research and development (R&D) should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in switching device physics, design and fabrication.  Specifically excluded is R&D that primarily results in incremental or evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

Abstracts are not required or requested for this amendment.  To be considered for funding, full proposals must be submitted by 4:00 PM EST on January 10, 2008.
BAA07-18, Amendment No. 4 will remain open through 4:00 PM  EST on January 10, 2008 (45 days) to allow proposers to address the specific Advanced Photonic Switch (APS) topic area discussed herein.   Proposals responding to the APS topic area received after the 45 day period has expired may not be evaluated.

The objective of this PBC contract is to reduce the Air Force life cycle cost while maximizing the number of sites closed at Former Bergstrom AFB, Texas; Eaker AFB, Arkansas; England AFB, Louisiana; Homestead AFB, Florida; Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina; and Reese AFB, Texas.  The Air Force prefers to maximize the number of Site Closures.  If Site Closure cannot be obtained, the next preferred objective is to reduce life cycle costs through Optimized Exit Strategies.  Maintaining the status quo, while acceptable, is considered the least preferred objective.  

The period of performance (POP) of this solicitation (including options) will be ten years with an estimated award date in first quarter FY08.  Offerors are required to stay within the AF budget. The total projected ceiling for this program is $32.6M. The anticipated ceiling for the full and open award is $19.2M; and the anticipated ceiling for the Small Business set aside is $13.4M.  The Status Quo rough order of magnitude (ROM) is based on the continuation of the current AF approach (e.g. status quo) on all sites for the next 10 years.  The Full Site Closure Scenario is based on all sites in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) within the POP with no financial liabilities being returned to the AF.

The Government plans to award two (2) contracts.  The Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded to a large or small business under a full and open competition and anticipates that the other contract will be awarded as a small business set-aside.  The Full and Open competition will be open to both large and small business contractors and will address the restoration and site closure requirements at the former Myrtle Beach and England AFBs.  The small business set aside is only open to small business and will address the requirements at the former Reese, Bergstrom, Homestead, and Eaker AFBs.

 
Large business firms must comply with FAR 52.219-9 ?Small Business Subcontracting Plan?. The subcontracting goals/targets for the South PBC contract are as follows: 

Small Business  28% of total awarded or obligated dollars
Small Disadvantaged Business  5% of total subcontracted dollars

<DESC>KC-135 AIRCRAFT EXTENSION PROGRAM (AEP) INCREMENT I, BLOCK 45 MODIFICATION PROGRAM

 
The 551 Aircraft Sustainment Squadron (ACSS), 827th Aircraft Sustainment Group (827 ACSG), Tinker AFB OK, is submitting an industry notification for the Block 45 Modification Program. 

FOR PLANNING PURPOSES 
 
The purpose of this notification is to provide industry with information regarding the status of the Block 45 Modification Program.  To this point the Air Force has issued several Requests For Information (RFI)?s and held one industry day.  The Air Force is aware and appreciates the extensive efforts industry has put forth in developing responses and researching solutions for the RFI?s and the previously anticipated Request For Proposal (RFP) in Nov 08.

The Air Force is now asking any efforts industry is putting forth towards a Block 45 solution be temporarily suspended.  The Air Force is reassessing the Block 45 contents due to changes in Air forces policies concerning modifying legacy platforms with new capabilities.  At this point, the Air Force can not confirm what modifications Block 45 will contain.  Obviously, Block 45 will not be an FY08 contract award and depending on the new make-up of the program, it may not be an FY09 award.  The Air Force anticipates program will remain an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program managed at OC-ALC by the 551 ACSS.  

GENERAL INFORMATION 
As soon as the Air Force determines the contents of the program, an RFI will be released on FedBizOpps webpage (http://www.fbo.gov) for elements of the solicitation and intends to host another industry day prior to releasing draft and final RFPs.

The National Assessment Governing Board is preparing to set achievement levels on the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in Science at Grades 4, 8, and 12. The Governing Board plans to issue a Request for Proposals in April-May 2008, under full and open competition. Proposals will be due in July-August 2008. The period of performance is anticipated to be twelve (12) months with one twelve month option period.

The science achievement levels will be set in accordance with the Governing Board's policy for setting achievement levels. The Board's policy on achievement levels was adopted in 1990 and has been amended several times thereafter. Achievement levels-setting procedures for science shall take into account the unique features of NAEP as a survey of student performance for which no individual student scores are reported; the specific features of the NAEP 2009 framework and specifications; the history of NAEP achievement levels; the Congressional requirement to show that NAEP achievement levels are useful, reasonable, and valid; and current research in standard setting. 

The basis of contract award will be the technical capability of the offeror to provide the required services combined with cost factors. All responses received by the due date will be given full consideration

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>As the Contracts Officer Representative (COR) for the Oracle/PeopleSoft software products used in the Department of States Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS), I recommend the use of other than full and open competition for the purpose of purchasing software support for its continued maintenance.  The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the products -- however software support is a separate expense and represents an ongoing annual expenditure.  The action to be approved is the order for Peoplesoft software support obtained through the Federal Supply Schedule contract with the most qualified provider. PeopleSoft products are the basis for much of ILMS.  The PeopleSoft products currently used by ILMS include: PeopleSoft Inventory, PO, CRM Support server license, Object Studio,  Balanced Scorecard,  Enterprise Warehouse,  Supply Chain Management,  Activity Based Management,  GL, and AM modules A full description of the software support services required for this purchase can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for the selected provider. The authority for sole source orders under GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts is Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 501). Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support.  This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS.<BR><BR>ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system.  ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000.  ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System.  In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc.  ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support.  Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS. Upon review of possible sources, a vendor will be chosen for software support for Oracle/PeopleSoft legacy software products.   Since the services for the same software support were obtained last year, the universe of vendors has remained the same.   These support services are necessary to maintain the existing production version of ILMS.  The need to have PeopleSoft's technical support for the PeopleSoft software cannot be restated in a way that would permit the use of other commercial or non-developmental items. In the course of the development of ILMS, the Government made a serious effort to assure that Accenture, as the prime contractor, obtained as much competition as possible in subcontracting components of the task -- such as the software licenses and support contracts that it executed. To date, no sources have written to express an interest in this acquisition. When the Government assumes responsibility from a contractor for software licenses and support requirements that are integral to much larger IT systems, it is effectively precluded from competing the periodic renewal of such licenses and support agreements -- particularly if the systems involved have been customized and involve numerous proprietary components.  The best alternative available to the government is to negotiate and contract for long-term license and support agreements at the offset.<BR><BR>Added CSI numbers to each line item as additional information.<BR><BR>

In the course of the development of ILMS, the Government made a serious effort to assure that Accenture, as the prime contractor, obtained as much competition as possible in subcontracting components of the task -- such as the software licenses and support contracts that it executed. To date, no sources have written to express an interest in this acquisition. When the Government assumes responsibility from a contractor for software licenses and support requirements that are integral to much larger IT systems, it is effectively precluded from competing the periodic renewal of such licenses and support agreements -- particularly if the systems involved have been customized and involve numerous proprietary components.  The best alternative available to the government is to negotiate and contract for long-term license and support agreements at the offset.<BR><BR>Added CSI numbers to each line item as additional information.<BR><BR>

Inquiry:  Ref. 1.2  Please describe what the VA Security Requirements are or provide the appropriate VA security requirements documents with the RFI.

Response:  The VA has developing and evolving standards, generally but not always, consistent with international nomenclature (i.e. SNOMED, IOTA, etc.) and existent data dictionaries.  However, it also has evolving independent definitions (including the HDR).  These standards are available on the VA Intranet and would be made available to vendors selected once a solicitation for proposals is awarded. VA also has interfaces with its HIS developed by Document Storage Systems (DSS).  It is anticipated that the DSS interface will further be definitive of specific elements structure for vendor utilization. 3.

Inquiry:  Ref. 3.4.9 - Please explain and provide examples of what you mean by variable/alias names and what you are requesting in this field.  Are you referring to Patient Names, Field names, etc? Response:  This refers to the VA's requirement to not be "locked in" to vendor existent defined requirements for data specific elements. In other words, the vendor must have the capacity to rename CIS data elements with aliases or other end-user defined names. 5.   Inquiry:  Ref. 5.10.6 - Explain VistA Time Protocols. Response:  The DSS interface specifications will encompass time synchronization between systems. 6.   Inquiry:  Ref. 5.10.7 Clarify/define CPRS Critical Care Alerts. Response:  This would encompass immediate "critical" alerts as created within VISTA, such as critical Lab values, change in status, allergy modifications, etc. DSS interface will be utilized for the transference of such alerts. 7.   Inquiry:  Ref. 5.14 Please explain patient taxonomies in VistA.  This refers to the standard elements as included in ICD9 and CPT coding structure.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
The 827 ACSG Contracting Office Tinker AFB, OK is requesting information on replacement systems for 337 KC135R/T aircraft.  

PURPOSE

The purpose of this RFI is to create a dialogue with industry.  With this notice, the 827 ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK is seeking comments from potential vendors concerning the appropriate strategy for a competitive procurement that supports the objectives of the Block 45 program.  Your comments will help refine procurement strategy.  Block 45 is considering a performance-based procurement with a single contractor solely responsible for all aspects of the modification.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.     

DESCRIPTION

Block 45 is Increment 1 to KC-135 Aircraft Extension Program (AEP) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) Develop and field required capabilities to extend KC-135 as viable weapon system through 2040.  The Block 45 modification consists of four modifications that will
enable mitigation of capability gaps anticipated due to expected airspace restrictions of Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management System (CNS/ATM), resolve mission suitability shortfalls, shortcomings in reliability, maintainability, and supportability.  Block 45 includes (1) Digital Flight Director (DFD) includes replacing Angle of Attack (AOA); (2) Radar Altimeter (RA); (3) Autopilot (AP).

Services to include research and development, technology insertion, system integration, installation, fabrication/prototyping, testing/certification, aircraft ground/flight testing support at Edwards AFB, studies/analyses, logistic support services, training and engineering support services, including re-engineering and reverse engineering, for a range of equipment.  Contractors may use commercial products or existing government inventories to provide the best value solution using processes and practices to reduce cost and schedule and performance risk and to promote future competition for design upgrades and operational support costs. 

Modification Installation effort:  At present, the Government is planning on contractor installation of the modification kits at contractor operated facilities.   A possibility does exist to have the Government install the modification kits using Government personnel at Government owned facilities.  Therefore, the Government is considering a contract structure that allows installation by the Government or contractor as an option to be unilaterally determined by the Government.  The Government is considering variable quantity pricing to allow for program funding changes.  

Businesses with the capability of providing the required services are invited to submit, on a voluntary basis, in writing, sufficient information that demonstrates their ability to fulfill this requirement, information concerning performance-based contract measurement recommendations, contract type, and any other relevant recommendations.  


RESPONSE:

The information you provide may be used by the USAF to ascertain and develop technical and programmatic acquisition approaches and/or strategies. Data obtained from this request will be considered and may be used for advanced planning, program phasing, and to define tailored technical requirements. As such, your inputs should not be restrictive or proprietary in any fashion. Although the identification of the contributing companies will not be divulged outside the Government, the Government reserves the right to use in whole or part any industry information received as a result of this RFI as part of a future acquisition strategy. Your participation in the RFI will not affect your company's position during any solicitation, nor will this RFI be used as criteria for the prequalification of respondents for future solicitations.

Period of Performance: Please see the attached DRAFT schedule in FBO.  
a.	We are contemplating awarding a 9 year contract.  Can you accurately reflect your costs for this Period of Performance? 
b.	Are there any concerns regarding this period of performance?
c.	Do you feel there is enough time in the SDD development stages?  What schedule would best represent realistic schedule goals?
d.	What do you envision as the program risks (technical, cost, schedule)? Include associated rationale. How could the risks be minimized?
e.	Would any unique support equipment or test equipment need to be procured or provided?
f.	At present, the Government is planning on contractor installation of the modification kits at contractor operated facilities.  A possibility does exist to have the Government install the modification kits using Government personnel at Government owned facilities.  Therefore, the Government is considering a contract structure that allows installation by the Government or contractor as an option to be unilaterally determined by the Government. 
a.	Would your firm be interested in responding to an RFP given this proposed procurement approach? Please provide comments. 
g.	The Government is considering variable quantity pricing to allow for program funding changes.  Does industry support a flexible pricing arrangement to allow for changes in the quantity of modification kit production and installations? 
h.	What is the maximum Kit rate production per year your company can support?
i.	What is the maximum installation rate per year your company can support?

Performance Incentives:  
Please describe incentives that could be employed through a contract to encourage excellent performance, compliance with schedule requirements and cost reductions.  

a.	Describe metrics that should be employed during each phase of performance.
b.	Describe the frequency and method of data collection associated with metrics and incentives or remedies (positive and negative) associated with the metrics.
c.	What incentive programs does your company feel will accelerate schedule and reduce cost? 
Contract Pricing:

a.	The Government is considering variable quantity pricing to allow for program funding changes.  Does industry support a flexible pricing arrangement to allow for changes in the quantity of production kits?  
b.	The Installation portion of the effort is a major cost to the Government.  Are there any additional initiatives industry proposes to assist in meeting schedule while maintaining or lowering cost parameters?
c.	Are there any contract types you would recommend for this contract? Please explain rationale.  The Government is contemplating the use of a single contract consisting of several different types of contract line items, to include:
i.	SDD through LRIP ? Cost Plus (incentive)
ii.	Kit Production -Fixed Price Incentive, 
iii.	Modification Installation - Firm Fixed Price 
d.	What type of pricing arrangement(s) would you recommend for the contract?     
e.	Explain your anticipated warranty terms and conditions.
f.	The Government plans to require a guarantee of predicted Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) for a period of 10 years.  This will require the contractor to modify/upgrade installed Block 45 equipment to meet predicted MTBF.  What would you consider the limit of the contractor?s liability for the guarantee/warrantee?  System MTBF requirements are as follows:
	THRESHOLD	OBJECTIVE
FD	4,000 hrs	7,000 hrs
RA	2,000 hrs	3,500 hrs

Does industry see the use of a SIL to be a benefit to the program?  What is the industry opinion on the impact of having a Government owned SIL available?   The Government plans on accepting, as a contract deliverable, the Block 45 SIL as part of our Acquisition Strategy.  Is there any return on investment?   
  
Technical Data 

a.	The Government is considering buying level 3 engineering drawings, technical data, and manuals. Identify what software programs are utilized to generate these data products and what formats are available for delivered items?
b.	Are there potential proprietary data with the Government strategy?  
c.	Are any of the above conceptual requirements unrealistic?  If so why?  
	
Production of Block 45 Modification Kits:  
a.	Does the proposed schedule allow sufficient time for the production of modification kits to meet installation schedule?  
b.	Do you anticipate long-lead material issues?

<CONTACT>kevin.w.hill1, 210-292-3270
<DESC>A.	General Information. <BR><BR>     The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisia na, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of General Woundcare (Sponges).   <BR><BR>The primar y objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product s be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to: Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston TX; Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland AFB TX; Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort  Hood TX; Reynolds Army Community Hospital (ACH), Fort Sill OK; William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss TX; 10th Medical Group, USAF Academy CO; Evans ACH, Fort Carson CO; General Leonard Wood ACH, Fort Leonard Wood MO; Irwin ACH, Fort Riley KS; 9 9th Medical Group, Nellis AFB NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH, Fort Polk LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In ord er to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process  and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dsc p.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinica l, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become mor e important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make  two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) is seeking product line items  in the category of General Woundcare (Sponges), which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $470,812.25.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor s ales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include: Gauze Sponges, Bulk $229,219.52; All Purpose Gauze Sponges $78,863.73; Gauze Cover Sponges/Peel Back 4 x4 Sterile $31,653.21; Gauze Sponges Sterile 4 x 4 in tr ay $7,269.05.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region (6, 7 & 8) MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor or der numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>INTERESTED RESPONDENTS MUST PROVIDE DETAILED HARD COPY RESPONSES TO THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA REQUIREMENTS STATED WITHIN THIS NOTICE BY 3PM CST ON 17 APRIL 2008. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from par ticipating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide hard copy responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for mail to be lost, v endors must confirm with the Regional Point of Contact (POC) stated below that their submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  Each submitting vendor will con firm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>Responses should be sent via your preferred delivery carrier with a requested return receipt and/or tracking number to Ms. Sarah Allen, Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  (ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS TO INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTED)  Contact Ms. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this a nnouncement with any further questions.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatmen t Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested respondents are to respond to this FBO announcement by mailing their intent to participate wi th hard copies of the following information: company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, announcement number, DAPA number and complete answers to the technical criteria to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors  are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, r esponses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAP A will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); 5) the vendor inten ds to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); 6) Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement  to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, National FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA.  and 7) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from f urther consideration.<BR><BR>If industry participation is unsatisfactory, the TPRB will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR><BR>All e-mail c ommunication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Also, all communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>The vendors who meet the fol lowing technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process<BR><BR> The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendo r must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of General Woundcare (Sponges).  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendo r contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  At a minimum, this includes:   (a) All Purpose Sponges (sterile & non-sterile) (b) Bandage Gauze (sterile & non-sterile) (c) Disposable Lap Sponge s (sterile & non-sterile) (d) Sponge Surgical Gauze, Bulk 2x2s; 4x4s; 4x8s.  Provide certification of all brands of this product line that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a l ack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the General Woundcare (Sponges) product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with  the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor, Cardinal Health for distribution in this  Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standa rdization initiative.  (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy pricing quotes and a competitive product cross-reference in the prescribed electronic Microsoft E xcel format upon request. Note: All e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed.<BR>6.	Vendor must provide educational information for Wound Care, General (Sponges) as well as no cost samples for the evaluation.    <BR>7.	 Vendor must provide customer service (telephonic, onsite, website or email) for regional facilities.  Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal. <BR>8.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal.<BR>9.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or FDA or company recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the product line including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals. <BR>10.	All products are labeled with product description (i.e. dimensions, sterility, ply count).<BR>11.	All surgical sponges (laparotomy and gauze ) must contain a radiopaque devise.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process:    The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team facilitated by the TRBO will request samples (at no charge to the government) from the product line to be clinica lly evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped  to arrive at the MTF by COB, 3PM CST, on the (21st ) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified fr om further consideration in the standardization process.<BR>  <BR>CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical evaluation period is estimated to last approximately eight weeks.  The CPT will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like one to five rating scale where as: One (Does not meet minimum needs - worst score), Two (Meet minimum needs but is not clinically r ecommended), Three (Meet minimum needs), Four (Exceed minimum needs), Five (Provides superior clinical advantages - best score).  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT wil l analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically  unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.  <BR><BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT will determine/approve that, product educational information and sample sets are required for the evaluation. The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and re sults will be forwarded to the CPT for review.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price.  Based on the clinical evaluation results, the CPT will provide a vendor selection recommendation to the TPRB. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Cr iteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: <BR><BR>Minimal Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1.  Sponges may be cut to the desired shape without shredding/unraveling (to prevent introducing debris).<BR>2.  Sponges are highly absorbent (designed to transfer exudate from wound)<BR>3.  Products are low linting/free of foreign particles (to prevent introducing debris)<BR><BR>P hase III  Pricing Analysis Process. <BR>1.	 The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (a) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (b) Potential Cost Avoidance, (c) Impact of Unmatched Lines, a nd (d) Impact on SKUs by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.    <BR>2.	Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability tar get threshold will be qualified to submit best value pricing for analysis to the TRBO.  Those vendors with results less than 3.0 will be disqualified from further consideration depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are cluster ed near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Upon request, vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of  request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Central Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the v endor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain th e vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region) .  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest num ber that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Upon request, vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pri cing analysis. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly mo re important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.<BR>7.	The Central Region TPRB reviews the data for a best value decision.<BR>8.	The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the Dis tribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the submittal.<BR>9.	The Central Region TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendors selection(s ). The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combina tion of MTF preference and product availability.<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>A--POTENTIAL SCIENCE INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE JOINT DARK ENERGY MISSION
<SOLNBR>NNH08ZDA007L
<RESPDATE>050108
<ARCHDATE>03262009
<CONTACT>Dr. Michael  Salamon, Program Scientist, Phone 202-358-0441, Fax 202-358-3096, Email michael.h.salamon@nasa.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) Potential Science Investigations for the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) Astrophysics Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Solicitation Number:  NNH08ZDA007L Release Date:  March 28, 2008 Response Date:	May 1, 2008 NASA intends to issue an Announcement of Opportunity (AO) in late 2008 to solicit proposals for the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) science investigation. A space-based mission, JDEM is intended to measure the properties of dark energy with accuracy much greater than that achievable with previous space-based or ground-based facilities. Although NASA will issue the AO, JDEM is jointly supported by NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE). Both agencies will participate in JDEM, which will be a medium-class strategic mission with a competitively selected, Principal Investigator (PI)-led dark energy science investigation. DOE and NASA will partner in the fabrication and operation of instrumentation necessary to execute the science investigation. To allow any member of the scientific community to provide input to NASA that may prove useful in the writing of the JDEM AO, NASA is issuing this RFI to request information regarding potential space-based dark energy investigations. Specifically, submissions that fully describe possible mission implementations, along with life cycle cost information, will be of greatest use. Background JDEM is one of three Einstein Probe missions spelled out in NASA?s Beyond Einstein Roadmap, with a targeted total life cycle cost cap of ~$600M (FY08$) excluding launch vehicle cost. This cost cap includes NASA, DOE, and any other domestic or international contributions. Following the Announcement of Opportunity in late 2008, the science investigation will be selected in 2009, with a project start that same year. The launch of JDEM is planned for 2014-2015, and a nominal science operations lifetime of three years is assumed, although not required. All information received from this RFI will be considered confidential and proprietary if so requested. NASA intends to utilize the support contractors Aerospace Corporation and SAIC to review these responses. Both Aerospace Corporation and SAIC have support contracts with NASA which prohibit the distribution of data related to competition sensitive or proprietary information outside of the government. It is not NASA?s intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained during this RFI. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as ?Proprietary or Confidential? will be kept confidential. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Instructions for Response The response to this RFI will be in the form of a PDF document that is uploaded through NASA's NSPIRES system. The response should not exceed fifty pages in length.   Material in a RFI response is confidential, nonbinding on the respondent, and will be used by NASA for information and planning purposes only. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. No proposals will be awarded funding as a result of this RFI. The complete RFI including background, requested information, and instructions for responding may be found at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/	  (select "Solicitations" then "Open  Solicitations" then "Request for Information (NNH08ZDA007L) Potential Science Investigations for the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM)"). Responses to this RFI must be submitted no later than May 1, 2008. Contact Point Questions concerning this Request for Information should be addressed to Dr. Michael Salamon, Astrophysics Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546; email at michael.h.salamon@nasa.gov.

<DESC>Several organizations have sponsored significant development of standards for Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) - class spacecraft.  These include:  the former Office of Force Transformation (OFT), now part of the Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E), executed by the Integrated Systems Engineering Team (ISET) lead by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU APL); by the Air Force Research Laboratory?s Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/RV); and other organizations including NASA.  The ORS Office intends to manage and lead further ORS standards development and extend the standards to other ORS pillars including launch vehicles, ground support equipment, and command, control, communications hardware and software. It envisions expanding participation in the activity to include other government organizations, FFRDCs, UARCs and industry through an Integrated Products Team (IPT). 

The ORS Office invites the submission of white papers from interested parties on how this Standards IPT should be organized and operated, what should be covered, and the best process for publication and maintenance of standards developed.  The concepts proposed should be non-proprietary allowing for the possibility that they may be incorporated into future procurements. The ORS Office contemplates releasing at a later date, an ORS BAA topic for proposals to support the standards activities.

<SUBJECT>15 -- Replacement AutoPilot System
<SOLNBR>RFI0006

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Replacement Autopilot System, Flight Director, Radar Altimeter (RA) and potentially Angle of Attack (AOA) systems for 417 KC-135R/T and 2 OC-135B Special Purpose Aircraft

NOTICE TO INDUSTRY: This RFI is for planning purposes only.  The 827 ACSG understands that components of the proposed C/KC-135 Block 45 Modification program are discussed within this RFI.  The proposed Block 45 Program remains on track for a release of a Draft RFP in the near future.  This RFI does not necessarily change the current Bock 45 modification program in its current form (Digital Flight Director, Radar Altimeter, NVIS, and Aeromedical).

PURPOSE
The 827th ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost, schedule, and performance parameters to remove the existing Digital Autopilot System (ASW-48), ALQ-141 Flight Director, AL-101 Radio Altimeters and potentially AOA systems and install a replacement dual Digital Autopilot (DA) System with Flight Directors (FD), RA, and AOA systems together with associated components (hardware, software, etc).  The installations for these efforts will be as a block, not separate stand alone installations.

DESCRIPTION
The KC-135R/T and OC-135B aircraft autopilot, flight director and radio altimeters need replacing due to obsolescence, poor reliability, and high maintenance costs.  Replacement DA with FD, RA and AOA systems should use Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) or Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) equipment to the maximum extent possible.  The modified aircraft must meet current and planned FAA and ICAO requirements including, but not limited to:  Worldwide capability and certification with Required Navigation Performance (RNP) of 0.15 (total system accuracy of 0.15 nautical miles 95% of the flying time).

New systems must:
- Maintain existing airworthiness certification
- Be protected against electromagnetic pulse
- Ability to store and provide any detected faults and provide maintenance crews with fault verbiage

The proposed dual DA with FD must provide the following capabilities:
- Integrated 3-dimensional guidance and/or control for all navigation/approach solutions and provide for aircrew cueing and warning via the currently installed integrated multi-function displays and cockpit warning systems
- Expandable and upgradeable to support future growth toward 4-dimensional navigation, auto-throttles, integrated altitude alerting, and category landing capabilities
- Continual crosschecking 
- Vertical navigation (e.g. provide the ability to bring the aircraft to approach from cruise altitude) while providing airspeed or throttle queues to the aircrew for airspeed deviation through annunciation (there are no auto-throttles on the KC-135)
- Autopilot system should receive and provide digital outputs to all associated systems with the exception of those requiring servo, synchro, or other analog signal inputs
- When installed, the system will be able to accept aircrew-selectable air refueling receiver type profiles to allow autopilot to compensate for incoming receiver aircraft, reducing the number of un-commanded autopilot disconnects
- Dual autopilot control panels
- Provide dual surface sensing at the horizontal stabilizer
- Perform yaw control on OC-135 aircraft and potentially on KC-135R/T (replacement KC-135R/T yaw control must include engine failure Assist system and series yaw damper functions).
- Ideally use the existing MAX and AL-CL take-off profiles.

The proposed RA must provide the following capabilities:

- New receiver-transmitters and coax cables
- Low probability of intercept mode or ability to turn off emission.
- provide altitude inputs to all equipment currently supported, while providing digital altitude data to the new DA systems
- redundant data to all systems now using AL-101 data.
- Ideally provide redundant digital data to all systems now integrated with the AL-101
- Provide altitude data from 0-2500 feet with 0-50,000 feet desired.
- Error crosschecking between receiver-transmitters and report to crew errors in excess of 4 feet from 0-100 feet and 4% above 100 feet. 

RESPONSE
Responses shall address:
1.	Performance parameters, to include design, installation, reliability, and maintainability data
2.	Please break out the total program estimated (rough order of magnitude) cost information with breakout of non recurring engineering, modification kits, and installation (each broken down by systems) with the following items called out on a spreadsheet: DA, DFD, RA, AoA, Total Program Cost. In the break down of cost include NRE, Group A/B Kit, Install and total at the bottom of each item. 
3.	Delivery schedule/product availability
4.	Any alternatives/suggestions that satisfy airworthiness requirements, to include cost and schedule
5.	Provide separate pricing for overhaul data.
6.	Developmental schedule (duration from contract award to on aircraft testing completion)
7.	Component lead times (the longest lead time only for each system is required)
8.	Estimated support equipment (broken by system)
9.	Any alternatives/suggestions that satisfy airworthiness requirements, to include cost and schedule

Interested firms should also include the following in their response:

-Company Name and Address
-CAGE Code (if available)
-Point of Contact
-Size of Business (i.e. Large/small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concern, Minority-owned business)
-U.S. or Foreign Owned Entity

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is in search of vendors who can provide maintenance services and technical support services to the existing telephone systems in the various SSA field offices and provide telephone systems for emergency needs. 

There are approximately 2,000 offices at over 1500 specific locations installed in various SSA Field Offices (FO), Area Director Offices (ADO) and Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR) field offices throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.  The interested vendors will be required to be knowledgeable and able to support the various telephone system models and approximate quantities of 778-Fujitsu F9600s, 451-Executone IDS 108s, IDS 228s, and Medleys, 248-ESI-IVXs and ESI IVX 128s, 5-Iwatsu, 4-Intertel AXXESSs, 3-NEC 704is, 2-Omegas, 1-Comdial, and 1-Cisco ICS 7750 telephone systems at these locations.  Some locations may have multiple telephone systems and in-phone and/or overhead paging systems that are connected to the existing systems.  The requested maintenance services that SSA is seeking will be for (1) base year and four (4) option years.

The maintenance and on-going support services will include, but not be limited to repair, labor, materials, and replacement parts necessary to keep these telephone systems and related equipment in satisfactory working condition.  These ongoing services will include internal moves, adds and changes; remote programming, relocations, programming for spring and fall time changes, and various maintenance records and status reports. 

The annual maintenance shall also include the installations of Remote Service Observation equipment and Caller Recontact/Caller ID boxes used in the telephone access studies at 110 selected offices.  This yearly project entails de-installation of SSA owned RSO and Caller ID equipment, re-installation into a new set of Pilot offices, and maintenance of the project equipment. 

Services maintained through the systems shall include cable distribution from the point of demarcation established by the servicing local regulated telephone company to all demarcation
wire and cable, distribution frames, backboards and mounting materials.  The telephone systems will include all station equipment, automated attendant/voice mail systems, administrative terminals, automatic call distributors, telemonitors, caller ID boxes, telephone line protection, voltage protection devices (if applicable), paging systems and power supplies. 

Basic Requirements

All maintenance and support for telephone systems expansion (e.g., installation of line card, new station, etc) shall be accomplished without interruption to existing service during normal business hours (8:00 a.m. ? 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday and except Federal observed holidays).  However, the Principal Period of Maintenance (PPM) actually continues until 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time in order to accommodate sites on the West Coast. Reporting of maintenance related problems shall be via a contractor?s toll free number, which is available 24 hours a day, seven (7) days a week.  

Maintenance shall include travel, mileage, parts, materials and labor. The contractor is required to attend monthly technical meetings at the SSA?s Headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland to discuss on-going matters of importance and concerns relative to the telephone maintenance contract, if requested, and to participate from the contractor?s remote site in any telephone conference call with SSA staff and SSA Regional staff to discuss matters of mutual importance regarding the telephone maintenance contract.  

SSA is attaching a draft Statement of Work.  This SOW will use vendor response to assist in fine tuning and finalizing the maintenance SOW to be posted, listing the requirements requested by the government.   The vendor will be required to provide maintenance and on-going support services for existing telephone system expansions, relocations, move-add-change request, perennial time changes, various system reports and on-site or remote reprogramming changes to the systems on an as needed basis.

Additionally, the interested vendor shall be required to provide availability and access for the purchase and installation of approximately 500 telephone systems to the SSA during the life of the contract.  Additional system installation services, as required, for the term of the contract may also be provided. The SSA will guarantee installation of 45 of these new systems in the first contract year, of which the new systems are expected to be installed immediately and managed as a project by the vendor.  SSA plans to purchase an additional 55 telephone systems over the life of the project, with an option to purchase and install up to an additional 455 telephone systems at the discretion of the government.  These telephone systems will be basic telephone systems with no enhanced features (see attached draft maintenance contract with telephone system replacement section).  After the warranty period, the telephone systems will be added to the maintenance contract and maintained by the vendor.  The contract will be available for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option. 

At the request of the SSA, the replacement systems provided by the vendor will:
-	Be capable of growth
-	May require station moves
-	May be de-installed and removed 
-	Have services related to the installation of modular/systems furniture, 
-	May require changes to the up-front and queue greetings, 
-	May require general telephone system reprogramming,
-	May require reprogramming of maintenance modems. 

SSA is initiating the Telephone Systems Replacement Project (TSRP) to replace all of the SSA owned telephone systems over the next 4-5 years.  The number of telephone systems maintained will decrease with the implementation and installation of TSRP. The new TSRP will be installing new Telephone systems, replacing the aging legacy systems.  As these systems are replaced, they will be removed from this maintenance contract, causing a gradual decrease in the quantity of systems being maintained during this 4-5 year period.  The TSRP vendor will be responsible for the removal and disposal of the de-installed legacy telephone systems.  The government will notify the vendor of the specific offices as installation dates are scheduled, with at least 30 days prior notice.  These offices will be removed from the maintenance contract, via an email from the COTR on a monthly basis throughout the replacement.  When systems are replaced by a vendor, other than the TSRP vendor (i.e. the maintenance vendor?s installs), SSA may instruct the vendor to recover the old telephone system parts to assist in maintaining the current telephone systems.

Vendors responding to this Request for Information (RFI) should be made aware that this is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government and responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by SSA to form a binding contract.  SSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or pay for any information provided as a result of this RFI.  SSA will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with any RFI submissions or follow up information that is requested.

SSA is requesting the following:

1)	Vendor capabilities to provide parts and technical expertise to support the aging systems or alternative process to maintain systems.
2)	Proposed business processes to perform maintenance in these offices located throughout the Continental U.S., Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Alaska.
3)	Trouble Reporting processes and capabilities
4)	Suggestions for improvements on existing Draft SOW.
5)	Responses for partial capabilities, if submitting vendor cannot support all three manufacturer types.  
Information received will be considered solely to make informed decisions regarding a potential procurement. Interested sources that believe they have the ability to perform the services required should submit a detailed statement of their capabilities in writing to Michele Tubman, Contract Specialist, via email at michele.tubman@ssa.gov. Please reference SSA-RFI-MT001 in the e-mail subject line.  Responses must be received by 3:00 p.m. EST on January 24,2008.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN), Charleston, Code 741 (Advanced Law Enforcement Technology Branch), is seeking information on Operational Vests used for emergency responders in incident control operations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Authorized Equipment List (AEL) item number for this equipment is 03OE-01-VSTO. These vests include duty gear and modular load bearing systems worn by emergency responders which afford responders the ability to have essential equipment readily available when performing operation-specific tasks.

The yearly anticipated requirement is approximatel y 800,000 cartridges for FY09 through FY13.  Special equipment is required to produce these cartridges.  The manufacturing process encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) machining of projectile body metal parts, (2) production of propellant, (3) cartridge  case priming and loading w/propellant, and (4) load, assemble, and pack-out (LAP) of the completed cartridges.  For each step of the manufacturing process, sophisticated test and measuring equipment are required to ensure the final products comply with Go vernment requirements.  Knowledge in ballistic testing, propellant, and process engineering relative to the LAP of these cartridges is essential.  An approved ballistic test range, 20mm single shot test (MANN) barrel(s), and an M168 Automatic Gun are requi red to perform First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests on these cartridges.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining equipment, anodize and phos phate systems, ultrasonic test equipment, and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.  Production of these cartridges is complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.  Obtaining the critical skills, (i.e. ammunition process/design engineers, s et-up mechanics and operators familiar with the programming and operation of ammunition component sub-assembly production equipment, quality control engineers, ultrasonic technicians, metallurgists, ballistics test personnel, etc) needed to manufacture and  provide high quality ammunition in a timely manner may take time.  Due to the customers demand for timely deliveries, potential producers must be able to successfully conduct/complete a First Article Acceptance Test within 180 days after award, with the f irst production delivery due within 210 days after award.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice. The US Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) is conducting a market research survey to identify potential offerors for the development of thirteen (13) Joint Theatre Trauma Registry (JTTR) modules for the captu re of data to analyze wounds received in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and the subsequent maintence of these modules. This requirement must be able to work seemlessly with the Joint Theatre Trauma Registry version 3.0 ( JTTRv3) which is currently in use in Irag, Afghanistan, and at the USAISR. The thirteen modules are as follows (1) Create a singular store and forward stand alone application to capture injury data in theatre and following treatment data in military treatm ent facilities worldwide. The application will be able to support both manual data entry and data import/export capabilities to existing databases at the USAISR (2) Create a software module to capture orthopaedic injuries that will be interfaced with JTTRv 3 data and combined with data import/expert capabilities to existing databases at the USAISR (3) Add data elements, formulations or minor enhancements to the JTTR Store and Forward and the DOD Trauma Registry Store and Forward applications (4) Create a mod ule to capture Performance Improvement and Quality Assurance data that will be interfaced with JTTRv3 data and combined with data import /perport capaiblities to exisiting databases at USAISR (5) Create a module to capture outcomes data that will be interf aced with JTTR v3 data and combined with data import/export capabilities to existing databases at USAISR (6) Create a software module to capture images of injuries that will be interfaced with JTTRv3 data and combined with data import/export capabilities t o existing databases at the USAISR (7) Create a software module to capture mortality data that will interface with the JTTR v3 data and combine with data import/export capabilities to existing databases at the USAISR (8) Create a software module to capture  ophthalmology injuries that will be interfaced with JTTRv3 and combined with data import/export capabilities to existing databases at the USAISR (9) Create a software module to capture vascular injuiries that will be interfaced with JTTR v3 data and combi ned with data import/export capabilities to existing databases at the USAISR (10) create a software module to capture burn injuries that will be interfaced with JTTRv3 data and combined with data import/export capabilties to existing databases at the USAIS R (11) create a software module to capture neurological injuries that will be interfaced with JTTR v3 data and combined with data import/export capabilties to existing databases at the USAISR (12) create a software module to capture rehabilitiation data th at will be interfaced with JTTR v3 data and combined with data import/export capabilties to existing databases at the USAISR (13) create a web based software module to capture injuries that will be interfaced with JTTRv3 central site data and combined with  data import/export capabilties to existing databases at the USAISR.

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a R equest for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, AFIC is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept un solicited proposals.  Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expen se.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.

<SOLNBR>W91YTV-SAFETY-PHLEBOTOMY
<RESPDATE>041608
<ARCHDATE>06152008
<CONTACT>Sebrena L. Hackley-Lane, (706)787-2211
<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>A. General Information.  <BR>The Southeast Region TRBO Reg. 3, 4; a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Faci lities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardiz ation of SAFETY PHLEBOTOMY PRODUCTS.   <BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible  price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hos pital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order  to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp .dla.mil.<BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is November 2008.  The evaluati on will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation resul ts become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be based on the best-value, lowest-overall cost alternative quoted.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.     <BR>Point of Contact :Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil, 706) 7 87-2019<BR>A. Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of SAFETY PHLEBOTOMY PRODUCTS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an esti mated annual dollar requirement of $48,001.04. This is included as a reporting matrix.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical Com pany Criteria below.<BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types a nd packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>B. Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical company criteria and  (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil. Vendors that do net meet the dea dline of COB 5:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  <BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical cr iteria, no cost samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its in itial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.  <BR>C. Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clin icians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions or quotes.  Vendor quotes  should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quote s should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80 percent of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions an d request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Phase I  Technical/ Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to t he technical company criteria stated below.  All technical company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical company cr iteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified invited to participate in the clinical performance evaluation.   a.) In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factuall y correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical company criteria will require an additional, more specific definition of  technical acceptability.  The specific standard f or technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following Technical Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:     <BR>1.Vendor MUST provide a  complete line of SAFETY PHLEBOTOMY PRODUCTS.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordere d at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>a.At a minimum, this includes:  multi-sample blood collection needles incorporating active or p assive safety engineered features such as; shields, covers, sheaths, retractable needles, that attach to blood collection tube holder in sizes of 20 gauge with a length range of  ?, 1, 1 ?, 1 ? and 1 ? inches; 21 gauge with a length range of  ?, 1, 1 ?, 1 ? and 1 ? inches; 22 gauge with a length range of  ?, 1, 1 ?, 1 ?, and 1 ? inches;  23 gauge with a length range of  ?, 1, 1 ?, 1 ?, and 1 ? inches.  Also included in this product line are single use, multi sample disposable needle holders that will accomm odate, the previously listed needle sizes, gauges and lengths. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed.  <BR>b.Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in respons e to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed above. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>c.Vendors MUST provide supporting documentation that all SA FETY PHLEBOTOMY PRODUCTS that are manufactured and or distributed are FDA approved for use in all clinical (patient care) settings, and provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittal.  <BR>2.Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the SAFETY  PHLEBOTOMY PRODUCTS product line. Provide the DAPA number with initial submission. (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV), (currently, the prime ve ndor is Owens & Minor) for distribution of Safety Phlebotomy Products in the Southeast Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)   Provide supporting documentation of agreement wi th Prime Vendor with initial submittal.  <BR>4.Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discou nts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.Vendors MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficien t product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address with initial submittal.  <BR>6.Vendors MUST provide any histor y of back orders and or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12 month period for the SAFETY PHLEBOTOMY PRODUCTS, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back order s and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in re sponse to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.Vendor MUST provide SAFETY PHLEBOTOMY PRODUCTS that are latex safe and free. Vendor MUST provide a complete list of latex safe and free ite ms supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.<BR>8.Vendor MUST provide U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved safety engineered products.  Provide documentation to support with initial submission. <BR>Phase II  Clin ical/Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample set s from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery. Literature a nd product samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization i nitiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.<BR>Speci fic MTFs will evaluate the evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting using a Likert scale format with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not accepta ble, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) most acceptable and five (5) highly acceptable. All clinical performance criteria are equally weighted.  The clinical performance evaluation period will last for 30 days.  The CPT has establ ished a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the a ctual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical  professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that the clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>The following Clinical Performance Evaluation Crite ria have been established for this standardization initiative:  Vendor products meet the Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0. <BR>1. Needle and holder fit securely with each other when connected to be used for blood drawing procedure.  <BR>a. A n eedle and holder that fit together securely allow clinician to safely remove blood collection tube from holder thereby preserving integrity of blood sample.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c. Aft er assembling needle and holder evaluator will visually and manually inspect products for a tight, secure, stable fit.<BR>2. Upon visual inspection, needle bevel is smooth, pointed and without burr.<BR>a. A smooth, beveled, pointed, and burr less needle pu nctures the skin more easily increasing clinicians ability to perform procedure accurately and decreases patients discomfort during blood collection procedure.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c. Prior to use the evaluator will visually inspect needle for a pointed, beveled, burr-less surface.<BR>3. There is a clear and unmistakable change (audible or visible) that occurs when the safety feature is activated. <BR>a. The audible or visible indicatio n of safety feature activation indicates that the product is operating per manufacturers standards and may safely be discarded per OSHA guidelines.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c. When activat ing the products sharps injury prevention feature the clinician will listen for and visual inspect that the contaminated needle is safely obstructed from injuri ng clinician and/or patient.<BR>4. Once activated after use, the sharps injury prevention feature can not be deactivated and remains protective through disposal.  <BR>a. A properly functioning activated sharps injury prevention feature allows for the safe disposal of the contaminated product per OSHA guidelines, preventing injury to clinician and/or patient and the inability of the contaminated product to be re-used.<BR>b.This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR >c. After safety feature is activated, evaluator will visual observe and inspect product to assess that safety feature remains engaged and provides protection for patient and clinician.<BR>Phase IIIPricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical performance  evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold (at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors a verage scores) as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes based on committed volume of 80 percent of the total Regional requirement.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Accepta bility target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this stan dardization initiative.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure t o submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are avai lable, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and sele ct a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Re gion may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Clinical performance and technical company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical Company and Clinical Performa nce evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12 month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount  the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12 months of usage.  This is inclu ded as a reporting Matrix.(3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evalua tor cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post standardization costs. (4) Consideration of SKUs b y each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals/quotes.

The Air Force requires computational support for its multi-hit program to help plan tests and verify test configurations for detonations of weapons embedded in bare or soil covered reinforced concrete slabs. An advanced nonlinear transient analysis, three dimensional Computational Structural Dynamics code is required for these computations. This code should have advanced constitutive models capable of modeling cratering, spall and damage in blast and penetration environments as well as multiple loading states for reinforced concrete, metals and soils. In addition, there is a need to perform parametric studies for different penetration scenarios and multiple sequential and simultaneous loading sequences to help determine the effects of key parameters on damage to buried bunkers and slabs. This data will be used to help understand both small and full scale test results, relate small scale tests to full scale tests and generate a data base that can be used for fast running tools in such codes as MEVA and IMEA.

<DESC>Full Architectural-Engineering design services for the analysis, planning and complete design for implementing physical configuration aspects of entry security programs requirements at operational entrances to the U.S. Social Security Administration?s Headquarters Buildings on the campus in Woodlawn, Maryland in response to Home Land Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), the Policy for a Common  Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors. It is the intent of this procurement to award a single contract to design the security screening program and stations in the entrance lobbies to the campus buildings. This design effort includes but is not limited to analysis of pedestrian traffic flow at each entrance, development of entry screening area configurations to accommodate the screening requirements of the population entering and exiting at each entrance, development of alternative security configurations and final construction documents (plans, specifications and cost estimate). 

Project is primarily Security Program design which shall include architectural, mechanical, electrical, fire protection and interior design but will also involve design for related minor repairs, alterations and renovations. This procurement will result in a single analysis, planning and design contract with an option for post construction award services.  Options are normally exercised within several months of completing the work; however, delays of up to one year are possible.  

Hazardous materials such as incidental asbestos and lead may be encountered in the existing facilities. The A-E?s Industrial Hygienist may be required to identify and quantify the types and locations of hazardous materials that may be abated during the construction project.  Therefore, knowledge of airborne pathogen concerns is required. 

In addition, certain projects may be designed and constructed in metric, System International (SI) units in accordance with Public Law 100-576, the Omnibus Trade & Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Metric Conversion Act, and Executive Order 12770.  A-E firms will be required to demonstrate proficiency in metric design. 

GSA?s CAD Deliverables Policy will be incorporated as requirements of the awarded contract. The detailed CAD Deliverable Policy may be accessed on the Internet at http://www.gsa.gov/midatlanticcadpolicy/.       Contractor agrees that all CAD, AutoCad drawings and related files, photographs, drawings, renderings, blueprints, specifications and/or other materials generated for use by the contractor on the project, whether in machine readable form or not, shall belong at all times to the General Services Administration (GSA) and shall be delivered to GSA at the times specified and within the schedules contained in the Agreement or at the termination of the Agreement, whichever occurs first.

necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

2. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

3. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.     Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

SELECTION INTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS: Personal interviews may be scheduled for firms slated as most highly qualified. Firms slated for interviews may be asked to explain management and design team components, QC process; and to provide design solutions to actual/hypothetical projects, etc. Elaborate presentations are not desired. Note: A preliminary small business subcontracting plan will be required if a slated firm is a large business concern. 
Site visits will not be arranged during this period. Debriefing requests will not be entertained prior to 45 days after the submittal due date.

1.0	BACKGROUND

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  In November 2001, the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) formed the National Targeting Center (NTC) in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on America. It is the preeminent anti-terrorism facility for the Department of Homeland Security.  Originally started with 26 employees, it has now grown to more than 90 full time employees.  The NTC is a 24 hour, 7 day operation. It?s purpose is to provide proactive targeting aimed to prevent acts of terror, to seize, deter and disrupt terrorists, implements of terror, and to destroy the terror infrastructure. In April of 2007, the National Targeting Center Passenger (NTCP) and the National Targeting Center Cargo (NTCC) were established.  The NTCP operates in both a secure and non-secure environment. The NTCP generates targets based upon the results of research that it initiates. The NTCP focus is upon tactical information from which it generates actionable targets. The NTCP is composed of a dedicated staff of Watch Commanders and Target Analysts (TA) representing the CBP air, land and sea environments. These experts are multi-disciplined and are skilled at targeting inbound and outbound passengers and conveyances. 

Pursuant to the Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD)-6 and 11, it was mandated to integrate and maintain accurate and current information on all known or suspected terrorists, which resulted in the establishment of the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC).  The TSC, administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is a multi-agency effort where watch lists were consolidated into a single terrorist screening database (TSDB) to support all law enforcement measures of intelligence gathering and analysis on terrorists and their activities, and to ensure secure effective and timely interagency information sharing.   

The TSC-TSDB maintains these watchlists and accepts nominations of those individuals encountered that have not yet been watchlisted.  Although any agency can nominate an international terrorist for watchlisting, CBP-NTC routinely is the medium used for CBP Field Operations in the watchlist nomination process.




2.0	SCOPE OF WORK

The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide the Target Analysts at the National Targeting Center an online Fundamental Watch Listing Course.  The course will supply the TAs with a thorough understanding of the methodology for preventing attacks against the Homeland through the watchlisting process.  The course will meet the following objectives:

?	Provide a general description and overview of the watchlisting mission

?	Describe the international partnerships in watchlisting


?	Explain the relevant national policies affecting the practice of watchlisting

?	Provide an outline for watchlisting and the three level interdiction process


?	Identify key watchlisting databases and knowledge management tools

?	Describe the history of watchlisting and the changes in the watchlisting processes made in response to the 9/11 attacks


?	Identify who can nominate, the key parts of a watchlist nomination and the definition of ?good? biographical data.

?	Describe the main challenges/common criticisms of the watchlisting mission, to include the effect on privacy and civil liberties.


?	Identify the U. S. Agency watchlists currently integrated into the national-level watchlisting process


The course shall contain information, readings, case studies, discussions, and assignments that reinforce the learning objectives.  

Due to the work demands on the NTC employees, the course shall be offered in an online environment.  This allows the maximum flexibility for individuals to complete the course at their own pace and setting.  

In order to meet the objectives, the course will provide case studies and discussions to support a thorough understanding of the benefits of the watchlist program.

A course facilitator shall be made available to assist with case study assignments, discussion assignments, and any other support required to aid with the successful completion of the course.



2.1	Period Of Performance

2.2	Place of Performance
Although offered as an online effort, the primary place of performance for this effort is the National Targeting Center in Reston, VA.

2.3	Quantity of online Sessions
The provider shall make a maximum of 70 online sessions available for Target Analyst training.  



3.0	GENERAL INFORMATION

3.1	Sensitive Material
Due to the online nature of the course, the use of sensitive material is not permitted.

3.2	Use of examples and case studies
The provider shall provide case studies and examples that are pertinent to the course objectives and as current as possible.

    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-07-R-625199 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and offers being requested.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  This is small business set-aside procurement.    The NAICS is 721110.  The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with the provisions of FAR 13.5.  This requirement is to provide TEMPORARY MESSING AND BERTHING FOR THE CREW OF THE CGC HICKORY IN SEWARD, AK, DURING THE PERIOD OF 21 JAN THROUGH 18 FEB 2007. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (GC851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award of a contract will be based on the following criteria:  Past Performance and price.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract/s without discussions.  Therefore, offeror?s initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5. ********

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this solicitation is to provide additional PSC staff to provide program management functions for OTI's regional program teams.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

The Program Manager must be an individual with sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills and possess a well-developed understanding of US policy interests.

Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.  The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget and financial preparation and management, records management, travel assistance, etc) to help ensure programmatic success.

Stability.  The antibody drug shall be documented to be stable to the expiration date and the immunoassay shall meet all contract specifications to the end of expiration date (which is 180 days minimum).  

Antibody specificity.  Antibody specificity shall be verified for each lot and the specificity re-evaluated at routine intervals to ensure uniformity and quality of preparations. The reagent shall provide performance characteristics in terms of sensitivity and specificity for detection of the phencyclidine in urine as the current immunoassay procedure(s) used in the military laboratories.  The assay reagent shall be evaluated in terms of confirmation rate relative to screen positive rate (# of samples confirmed positive/# of samples screened positive x 100). A higher percent confirmation rate shall be considered better than a lower percent confirmation rate.  Specimens identified as presumptive positive by the offeror?s screening reagent shall be evaluated for the presence of phencyclidine equal to or above 25 ng/mL by the GC/MS procedure in the military laboratories.  Chemical compounds that may reasonably be found in urine resulting from prescription or non-prescription drug use shall be tested to characterize antibody specificity.  Specificity testing shall include biochemical materials produced normally in the human body (this may be evaluated by testing actual military member's urine specimens).

Immunoassays.  

Technical performance.  Performance of each lot of kits shall be verified.  The verification shall establish, as a minimum, the appropriate response to the target molecule and that all other parameters as specified in the contract are met.  

Stability.  The performance parameters involved in the testing procedures shall be verified and documented to be consistent throughout the shelf life of the kit.  

Manufacturer's production manual.  Procedures and criteria required to validate all components (and materials) employed during the manufacture of the reagents in the test kits and the operation of the completed kit over the entire period of shelf-life of the kit shall be described in detail.  All steps of each quality control procedure shall be described thoroughly.  

Records.  The production and quality assurance records generated by each procedure performed above shall be maintained in a systematic fashion to permit the verification of completion of all production parameters and shall be available for inspection during the term of the contract.  

Corrective action.  When a specified quality control parameter is found to be out of limits, the action taken to ensure correction for existing kits (i.e., notification) shall be documented and action taken to ensure that the deficiency does not reoccur and all records shall be retained. The Contracting Officer shall be notified within 2 working days of any deficiencies in existing kits and of all corrective actions for consideration, i.e., delivery of replacement kits at no cost to the Government.  The FDA shall be notified according to its regulations.  

Lot numbers.  Lot numbers shall be used to identify reagent and other preparations to allow tracking of all immunoassay components.  The procedures used to assign unique lot numbers for each solution or reagent shall be described.  A single lot number for a kit shall suffice if all materials used in that lot number can be tracked to identify the materials and procedures used in the preparation of that kit.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for equipment, supplies, training and instrumentation for (3) chemistry Analyzers.  The intent is to Sole Source this requirement under FAR 6.302 to Siemens, Inc.  This Combined Synopsis/Solicitation is prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ-CC-01476 is being issued as a Request for Quote.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516.  The National Institutes of Health of Health Clinical Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine intends on negotiating with Siemens, Inc. for the purchase of three (3) Chemistry Analyzers including supplies, training, service and instrumentation.  The Department of Laboratory Medicine provides laboratory testing necessary for patient care on a 24-hour basis.  The clinical research applications place a relatively high demand for analytical accuracy and volume of testing per patient relative to routine clinical practice.  Since some research protocols may extend over several years, it is important for laboratory values to remain consistent over time.  The Clinical Chemistry Service performs a high volume of laboratory tests that are essential for clinical diagnosis and monitoring and that serve as important data elements of research protocols.  A menu of about 100 different tests is offered, with about half of the tests available on a Stat basis in order to support patient care.  The contractor will provide reagents, supplies, instrumentation, training and service support to perform high volume testing more than 1,500,000 test results per year.  This will be replacement of current instrumentation which requires replacement due to age.  Major goals of replacement instrumentation are to improve the efficiency of testing, and to improve turnaround times for test results.  The new system is to replace 3 Beckman Coulter LX20 analyzers, which perform approximately 1,600,000 analyses on patient specimens annually.  The improvement of the newer system is to consolidate substantial amounts of testing currently performed on other analyzers.  Consolidation of testing, with a decreased total number of analyzers is essential in instrumentation.  THE PURCHASE OF THIS EQUIPMENT, SERVICE, SUPPLIES AND REAGENTS ARE BASED ON A COST PER TEST OR COST PER REPORTABLE RESULT BASIS, WITH NO CAPITAL PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT.  THE PRICING WILL BE BASED ON FSS SCHEDULE AGREEMENTS, AND THOSE ITEMS NOT ON FSS SCHEDULE SHALL BE IDENTIFIED AS OPEN MARKET ITEMS AS REASONABLE COSTS.  Approximately 20% of the workload is performed on a STAT basis with expected turnaround time less 60 minutes.  Completion of routine analyses is expected within 4 hours.  Specimen volume requirements are an important issue in order to conserve on blood volume of patients subjected to serial blood collections.  About 3% of specimens are microvolume specimens. where specimen dead volume and specimen volume used per analysis are important factors.  Specimens from animals are analyzed, including specimens from mice, where the amount of specimen is very limited. There is a strong interest in having measures of potential interfering materials in specimens such as hemoglobin, bilirubin, and lipemia; the laboratory has employed measures of serum indices for the past 10 years.  It is necessary for any new analyzers to perform at least the core menu offered by the current analyzers.  There is an interest in performing additional tests on new analyzers to consolidate platforms and improve efficiency of the laboratory.  Open channels are important for allowing test development work and allowing menu expansion.  Options for improved efficiency through automation of preanalytical steps in specimen handling are of interest.  

Minimum specifications:

1.  Provide core test menu 
Serum/plasma:  Albumin, alk. phosphatase, ALT, ammonia, amylase, AST, bicarbonate, BUN, calcium, chloride, cholesterol, CK, creatinine, direct bilirubin, glucose, HDL cholesterol, iron, lactate, LDH, lipase, magnesium, potassium, sodium, phosphorus, total bilirubin, total protein, transferrin or IBC, uric acid.
Urine applications: sodium, potassium, chloride, creatinine, urea nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, uric acid, urine albumin (microalbumin), urine total protein, urine drugs of abuse (including amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, cannabinoids, and opiates).    Cerebrospinal fluid applications for protein, glucose, and lactate.

2.  Electronic interfaces to the current version of the laboratory information system from Soft Computer Consultants (SCC) must be available.

3.  Backup capability.  The proposal will provide 2 or more redundant analytical systems that provide backup during maintenance or downtime.

4. Throughput and stat analysis time:   Systems should have a throughput allowing completion of stat tests within 60 minutes based on peak workload.  

5. Evidence for high accuracy of methods and reliability of analyzers.
Data supporting accuracy, precision, and susceptibility to interference of methods.
Low specimen and reagent carryover.  Robust sampling methods that minimize sampling errors related to bubbles, clots, or short specimens.
Information on instrument downtime and field performance supporting reliability. 

6. Service support:  Information regarding local service support.

7. Information security: Any external online access to the instrument must limit access to patient identification data and must be compatible with institutional information technology policies and standards.

Specialized Features

1. Capacity for a large number of different tests onboard each analyzer.

2. Large test menu:    Test menu is a major factor in providing opportunities for consolidation of testing platforms and specimens.

3. Low cost:   Low total annual cost corrected for menu. 

4. High labor efficiency:  Efficient maintenance, calibration, quality control, inventory management, and reagent and calibrator preparation.  Minimal sample preparation and handling for specimen dilutions and urine specimens.  Automated repeats according to selected criteria.

5. Ease of use:   The system should be simple for a large number of different operators to learn and to operate.  This is important for efficiency of training and operation as well as avoiding operator errors.

6.  Open channels:  Ability to run alternative reagents or to set up new tests not provided by the vendor.  Preferably with minimal requirements for intervention by the vendor to enter parameters or software adjustments.  Ability to access raw data for analysis.  This contributes to the ability to expand test menu and consolidate test platforms.  It contributes to the ability to perform extensive test evaluation and development of new tests.

7. Vendor support:   The vendor should provide good resources for support of maintenance, training, initial method validation, and technical support.  

8. Extended reagent stability:
Long shelf life of individual reagent lots.  Long onboard stability of reagents.

9. Extensive data on method validation and reference ranges:
For the laboratory to provide optimal support of clinical research protocols there is a need for substantial evaluation of comparability versus previous methods and collection of data on reference ranges.  More extensive method validation may be required than for a typical hospital laboratory setting.  Good consistency of results with different lots of reagents over a period of years is desirable.

10.  Minimal infrastructure requirements:
Special power requirements, number of LIS interfaces required, space requirements for instrument and supplies, water requirements, sensitivity to environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity are factors to consider.

12. Ability to perform medium and low-volume specialty tests efficiently
Reagent packaging in appropriate sizes and long reagent stability to avoid wastage of reagents for low to medium volume tests.  

13. Options for automating preanalytical steps
The laboratory does not anticipate implementing total laboratory automation, but is interested in future options for stand alone specimen processing and sorting systems or workcells that link specimen processing to a few primary analytical systems.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
                                                    Commandant (G-A)

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)    (Jun 2001)
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.
Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is February 28, 2008 @ 2:00PM local time.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>As the Contracts Officer Representative (COR) for the Oracle/PeopleSoft software products used in the Department of States Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS), I recommend the use of other than full and open competition for the purpose of purchasing software support for its continued maintenance. The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the products -- however software support is a separate expense and represents an ongoing annual expenditure. The action to be approved is the order for Peoplesoft software support obtained through the Federal Supply Schedule contract with the most qualified provider. PeopleSoft products are the basis for much of ILMS. The PeopleSoft products currently used by ILMS include: PeopleSoft Inventory, PO, CRM Support server license, Object Studio, Balanced Scorecard, Enterprise Warehouse, Supply Chain Management, Activity Based Management, GL, and AM modules A full description of the software support services required for this purchase can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for the selected provider. The authority for sole source orders under GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts is Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 501). Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support. This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS.<BR><BR>ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS. Upon review of possible sources, a vendor will be chosen for software support for Oracle/PeopleSoft legacy software products. Since the services for the same software support were obtained last year, the universe of vendors has remained the same. These support services are necessary to maintain the existing production version of ILMS. The need to have PeopleSoft's technical support for the PeopleSoft software cannot be restated in a way that would permit the use of other commercial or non-developmental items. In the course of the development of ILMS, the Government made a serious effort to assure that Accenture, as the prime contractor, obtained as much competition as possible in subcontracting components of the task -- such as the software licenses and support contracts that it executed. To date, no sources have written to express an interest in this acquisition. When the Government assumes responsibility from a contractor for software licenses and support requirements that are integral to much larger IT systems, it is effectively precluded from competing the periodic renewal of such licenses and support agreements -- particularly if the systems involved have been customized and involve numerous proprietary components. The best alternative available to the government is to negotiate and contract for long-term license and support agreements at the offset.<BR><BR>

HUEY II RFP Questions and Answers, 26 MARCH 2008:

1.  In your amendments to Solicitation FA3002-08-R-0009 Air Advisor Pre-Deployment Program Huey II Aircrew & Maintenance Training you stated that a Bell 210 can not be used because it has dual hydraulics. A Bell 210 is a FAA certified Huey II, the only difference being that the Huey II has a second generator attached to the transmission, whereas the 210 has a second hydraulic pump, as does the Bell 205++. So to state the Bell 210 can?t be used because of its dual hydraulics, contradicts why the Bell 205++ can be used since it also has dual hydraulics.  I?d like clarification on WHY the Bell 210 can?t be used for this contract?

AFTER FURTHER CONSIDERATION, THE BELL 210 CAN BE PROPOSED TO MEET THE HUEY II REQUIREMENT AS OUTLINED IN THE RFP. THE ANSWER TO QUESTION 2 IN AMENDMENT 01 IS HEREBY RESCINDED.

Background:  U.S. Government (USG) personnel are required to fly and maintain Huey II aircraft in support of Air Advisor support tasking.  USG training venues do not have existing capacity to support the additional requirement of five (5) Huey II helicopter pilots, three (3) Huey II helicopter flight engineers, and four (4) helicopter maintenance Air Advisors annually.  A contract is required to meet the additional Air Force (AF) requirements of 12 Huey II helicopter Air Advisor crewmembers and maintainers.  For the purposes of this contract, the ?Bell 205++? aircraft is used synonymously with ?Huey II.?

Objective:  Acquire contractor support for Huey II helicopter aircrew (pilot and flight engineer) and maintenance training.  Huey II ground and flying training instruction and course training materials shall be in English, in accordance with this Performance Work Statement (PWS), Attachment 1, and Attachment 2.  

Scope of Work:  Huey II Aircrew Training.  The Contractor shall provide all services necessary to qualify USAF helicopter instructor pilots to perform Pilot in Command (PIC) duties and USAF instructor flight engineers to perform Flight Engineer duties in the Huey II aircraft in one of two tracks (see Attachment 1, Sections A1 and A2).  

Pilot and flight engineer training for ?Track 1? (Attachment 1, Section A1) is designed for pilot and flight engineer instructors who are qualified in a USAF helicopter and who do not require instrument and mission qualifications.  Track 1 consists of approximately 24 hours of academics, two (2) hours of Cockpit Procedures Training (CPT), and two (2) hours of End of Course (EOC) Exam, minimum four (4) hours of simulator (or aircraft) training, and a minimum of eight (8) hours of flight training including a qualification flight evaluation.  This track shall include familiarization flight training in remote/unprepared surface operations and night/instrument flight rules (IFR) operations.  Track 1 provides basic, day VFR qualification in the Huey II.

PROJECT: New Construction & Repair and Alterations
PROJECT TYPE:   Various
CLIENT AGENCY: Department of Homeland Security
SIZE: BUDGET: Varied
GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:  
Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to plan and design new or expanded Federal facilities as well as repair and alterations of facilities to provide outstanding quality, value and operational design.  Projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for Federal employees.
In this context, The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Services for Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements and the facility will be designed in metric units. All new facility designs will be LEED certified, and shall be designed to meet the Silver standard as defined in the U.S. Green Buildings Council in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System to the extent the budget allows. 

Projects will be varied, including renovations, expansions or new facilities.  Expedited design and delivery approaches will be promoted, including prototype design, prefabricated and modular construction, and use of pre-designed components.  Thought should be given to the most appropriate and cost effective construction materials; and design, construction, and delivery methods suitable to the project.  Various project delivery methods, including traditional design and construction, and bridging-design-build, will be used. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a solicitation for A/E services for a period of one year with four additional one-year option periods.  Firms are not required to be geographically located in the State where the project is located, and are not required to have an active design production office within the State to be considered for award; however, successful A/E firms will be required to be licensed/registered within the State prior to the award of task order for a specific project and shall conform to all laws, rules, and requirements of that state governing the profession of architecture or engineering.

The selected A/E firm shall primarily provide design services, including feasibility studies, bridging documents (35% construction documents), and full design and construction services, and research and reports related to the design of Federal facilities.  The final designs may be operationally complex and technologically sophisticated site and civil-intensive projects with a balance between aesthetic, functional, and security issues, including state-of-the-art data and telecommunications systems, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other requirements.  Awardees under this requirement will not be eligible for award (individually or as a team member) on any design build projects resulting from work under any contract awarded under this requirement.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services may require: problem analysis, feasibility studies, energy analysis, life cycle costing, building information modeling, surveys, site and existing conditions surveys, design, planning, interior design, traffic and civil engineering, and estimating services for new construction, and repair and alteration projects. At times the contract may also require selected firms to provide civil engineering, boundary and topographical surveying, sustainable design, environmental studies, quality control testing, asbestos sampling/hazard assessment/ abatement design, historic structure reports, building evaluation reports, scope development, construction management, and other architectural, engineering and technical services. New construction may be up to approximately 50% site work and require extensive civil, traffic, environmental, signage and environmental graphics, as well as primarily architectural, landscape architectural, interior design, mechanical, electrical, structural services, and cost estimating, but may also necessitate geotechnical, fire safety, elevator, acoustical, lighting, historic preservation, construction management/inspection, surveyor and other disciplines with specialized experience. The selected A/E firms may be required to provide design services that include alternative energy, prefabrication or modular construction, and/or expedited design and delivery solutions.

The lookup table will be provided to the A/E during initial contract negotiations and shall be a mandatory payment provision.  In circumstances of more than one award per geographical zone, work orders will be placed based on technically competed proposals. 

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: 

Stage I 
In STAGE I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer. All documentation will be in an 8 1/2 inch x 11 inch format.

The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall indicate the lead designer and address the design approach with salient features for each project.  The narrative shall discuss how the client's mission, function, image, economic, schedule and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution. It should comment on the relevance of submitted projects to this request, including security, traffic design, remoteness, harsh climate, and phasing of projects or missions that are operational 24/7.  The A/E Firm shall also include a list of feasibility studies and other relevant reports or studies that the firm has completed.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. demonstrating design excellence. Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, fax numbers, and email.

(2)  PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%): In the Lead Designer's words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply in creating a state-of-the art Port of Entry along the northern and/or southern border (depending on zone).  Also include the Lead Designer?s philosophy towards alternatives methods of project design and delivery, such as prefabricated or modular design.

(3)  LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.

Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence. Where there is duplication with criteria (1), the Lead Designer will address his or her participation in the project. 

An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions. The Board will establish a short-list of up to 10 firms per zone who will be requested to submit the Stage II material.

Stage II
For Stage II, the firms short-listed in Stage I will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement. Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team. The Board will interview each team. Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the team?s understanding of unique aspects of the POE Border Program, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out generic projects and project management. The Stage II evaluations will culminate with an interview with the A/E Evaluation Board. Stage II rankings will be used in conjunction with Stage I rankings. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Parts I and II that reflect the entire design team.

ISSUANCE DATE: March 26, 2008
CLOSING DATE: April 9, 2008, 5:00 p.m. EDT 

SUBJECT: The purpose of this Amendment is to provide Attachment 1 for the Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for a Program Manager in Washington, DC.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   The solicitation number for this procurement is F2Q3658059A002 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541620. This requirement is a total (100%) Small Business Set Aside. SPECIFICATIONS:  Storm Water Comprehensive Site Compliance Evaluation for Langley Air Force Base.  

1.0	INTRODUCTION
1.1	General
The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) issued Langley Air Force Base (AFB) a Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) Individual Permit for Industrial Storm Water Discharges in May 2005.  The permit requires Langley AFB to perform an annual Comprehensive Site Compliance Evaluation (CSCE).  This evaluation ensures that the Base remains compliant with the permit?s requirements and the guidelines prescribed in the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).  
1.2	Scope
The purpose of this work is to perform the annual CSCE as required by the Base?s existing individual storm water discharge permit (VA0083194).  The completed document should be designed and tailored for its intended audience, being as brief as possible but still presenting the required information in a readily accessible manner.
The project shall be accomplished in three phases.  Phase I shall be the Kick-off Meeting.  Phase II shall encompass visual inspections of the individual base industrial activities, outfalls, and erosion and sediment control sites to perform the CSCE.  Phase III is the preparation of the CSCE report.  
The contractor shall furnish all materials, equipment, supplies, personnel, transportation, and all other resources necessary, to perform a CSCE, evaluate the efficiency of current storm water Best Management Practices (BMPs) identified during the site evaluation.
1.3	Applicable Laws and Regulations

?	Occupational Health and Safety Administration, Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1910.120, July 1, 1994.
?	Clean Water Act (as amended); 40 CFR 122.
?	DOD Directive 6050. 1: Environmental Effects in the United States of DOD Actions, July 1979.
?	Langley AFB Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit (No. VA0083194),           2 May 2005.
?	9 VAC 25-31-10 et seq. ? Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) Permit, 11 April 2001. 

Regulations and permits for Virginia may be more stringent than the federal laws and must be considered in assessments.  In addition, contractor must ensure that CSCE requirement meets all Air Force requirements, and appropriate regulatory guidance, to include but not limited to:

?	Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence, Installation Stormwater Pollution Prevention Guide, updated May 1997.
?	Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-7041, ?Water Quality Compliance,? 13 May 1994.
?	AFI 32-7080, ?Pollution Prevention Program,? 12 May 1994.
?	Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70, ?Environmental Quality,? 20 July 1994.
?	Executive Order 12088, ?Federal Compliance with Pollution Control Standards,?            13 October 1978.
?	United States Environmental Protection Agency, Storm Water Management for Industrial Activities, Developing Pollution Prevention Plans and Best Management Practices (EPA 832-R-92-006).

2.0	PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT
2.1	Government Furnished Material
The Government will supply the contractor upon request with available copies (either hard copy or electronic file) of engineering drawings of the installation?s storm sewer system including outfalls, monitoring stations, previous CSCE reports or related engineering studies, operating records and analytical results, and other documents that may be of value in defining the installation?s SWPPP issues.  The contractor shall reproduce these documents and return the originals to the government within 72 hours of issue. 
2.2 Points of Contact - See Below

2.3	Site Visits and Meetings - Agenda and Responsibilities 
Site visits and meetings are to be combined whenever possible.  The contractor shall prepare a meeting notice and agenda for each meeting attended by the contractor.  In addition to developing an agenda, the contractor shall prepare a presentation, appropriate for the occasion, and handle the administrative details of the meeting.  The administrative details the contractor shall perform, with assistance from the COTR, include: set the time and secure the location of the meeting, notify potential attendees of the meeting arrangements, pass out an attendance sheet at the meeting, take notes of salient points of the meeting, prepare and distribute a conference report on the meeting to all attendees within 14 calendar days of the meeting and revise the conference report should the government request it.
3.0	ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE TASKS
3.1	Phase I:  Kick-Off Meeting
The contractor shall initiate the project with a kickoff meeting at Langley AFB, VA. This kickoff meeting shall cover the CSCE requirement. During this meeting, the contractor shall introduce the personnel proposed to work on the CSCE and their respective roles and responsibilities.  The presentation shall be complete upon submission, by the contractor, of an organization flow chart illustrating the roles and responsibilities of contractor personnel on these projects.  
During this meeting, the contractor shall present his approach to both projects.  The contractor shall present proposed outlines, formats, and contents for the CSCE and demonstrate how this approach will best meet the goals of the project.  Also, the proposed agenda for the first meeting with the VDEQ regulators will be presented and discussed at this time. The contractor shall coordinate with 1 CES/CEVC to develop the agenda.  
3.2 Phase II:  Site Visits 
The contractor shall visit each individual base industrial activity to perform a Comprehensive Site Compliance Evaluation.  The evaluation shall provide the following information and documentation:

?	A visual inspection of areas contributing to storm water discharges associated with industrial activity.  The purpose being to identify existing and potential sources of pollutants entering the storm sewer system.  
?	An evaluation of measures to reduce pollutant loadings to determine if existing controls are adequate and properly implemented in accordance with the terms of the permit or whether additional measures are needed.
?	Structural storm water management measures, sediment and erosion control measures, and other structural pollution control measures identified in the plan shall be observed to ensure they are operating properly.
?	A visual inspection of equipment needed to implement the plan, such as spill response equipment, shall be made.
?	Based on the results of the inspection, the description of potential pollutant sources identified in the plan and pollution prevention measures and controls identified in the plan shall be revised as appropriate.
This task shall be accomplished in conjunction with Air Force personnel.  This approach allows the contractor to validate existing information and discuss additional modifications or improvements that can be incorporated into the CSCE.  A few of the industrial activities may require contractor support to update the information in the tables, but this will be a minimal requirement.  Phase II will require the site visits of 55 Buildings, 33 Erosion and Sediment Control Sites, and 11 Outfalls
3.3 Phase III:  Comprehensive Site Compliance Evaluation and Report
The contractor shall compile the information from the site visit and summarize it into a report.
The report shall contain the following information and documentation:

?	A summary of the scope of the inspection, personnel making the inspection, dates of inspection, and major observations relating to the implementation of the SWPPP.
