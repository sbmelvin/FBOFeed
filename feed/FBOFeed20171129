The DLIS US/Canada Joint Certification Lookup service is available via the Internet at http://www.dlis.dla.mil.ccal/.<br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307. Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. Preferred method to submit proposal is to upload through Dibbs. Submit e-mailed proposals to Kristina.Wolf@dla.mil. E-mailed proposals cannot exceed 15MB.

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.209-10, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations (Nov 2015).

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) Division has a requirement for two chartered fishing vessels with crew to conduct scientific trawl surveys of marine fish and crab populations in the Eastern Bering Sea Shelf (EBS).  These comprehensive and standardized trawl surveys and related research in the 200-mile territorial Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) waters of the EBS off Alaska are required to quantitatively monitor and describe trends in abundance and distribution of commercially and ecologically valuable groundfish and crab populations.  Data from these surveys is used to deliver annual estimates of groundfish and crab biomass and populations size and biological, habitat, oceanographic, and acoustic data for the eastern Bering Sea to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) Groundfish and Crab Plan Teams as needed for setting annual Allowable Biological Catch (ABC) and Total Allowable Catch (TAC) levels for groundfish and crab stocks in the Bering Sea.  In odd years (2019 and 2021), the survey is extended into the northern Bering Sea where an additional stations are sampled as part of the AFSC Loss of Sea Ice initiative.<br /><br />
<p>The baseline work consists of a series of bottom trawl operations conducted in the eastern Bering Sea over a base 55-day period that begins on or about May 26, but no later than June 7 of a given year for each charter. Alternate starting dates earlier or later than the preferred May 26 date may be considered. The fishing operations are conducted from two charter vessels and consist of 30-minute tows at fixed stations positioned along a 20 X 20 nm grid beginning in inner Bristol Bay with the vessels working on alternate columns of north-south stations, westward to the shelf edge to cover an area of 144,493 square nautical miles and fishing depths from 20-200 meters (11-109 fathoms).

<DESC>This is a synopsis for an intended Requirements type Long Term Contract (LTC) with Raytheon Company (96214) and serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis for all repair orders issued by the NAVSUP WSS for a five (5) year period estimated from 15 June 2019 through 14 June 2024 for the evaluation and repair of various repair components of the Navy Weapons System manufactured and repair. This intended LTC covers the repair of the Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) System in support of the F/A-18 aircraft. The items are specified within the attached document.

One or more of the items under this acquisition are subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements, and the remaining balance is subject to the Buy American Act (BAA), which requires delivery of end products of specified countries or as otherwise consistent with the governing statute and implementing regulations.
 The applicable BAA and TAA clauses and certificates will be included in the solicitation and contract. Other potentially applicable clauses and certificates, for example those governing specialty metals, commercial derivative military articles, and the prohibition against acquiring munitions list items from Communist China military companies, will also be included. No other restrictions (for example, those for clothing, roller bearings, etc.) have been identified as applying to the 60 items.

Orders issued under the Requirements type Long Term Contract and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
 Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The item required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source, you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697-4243 or is available online at:

https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navsupwss/business_opps

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer.
 Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement many continue base on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development intends to issue a single-award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with period of performance of five years and a ceiling of $8 million with a purpose to provide USAID/Central Asia with services of conducting external/independent special studies of various types. USAID intends to issue a solicitation for qualified small business offerors for this procurement.
<p>The USAID/Central Asia Learning from Evaluations &amp; Assessments for Development (LEAD) Activity will cover five Central Asian Republics: Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. USAID also anticipates issuing two initial Task Orders for the evaluations of the following activities: "Access to Information" and "Tajikistan Agriculture and Water".</p>
<p>The goal of the USAID/Central Asia LEAD IDIQ is to provide high quality technical and management expertise to support USAID/Central Asia and its partner Missions.</p>
<p>The following three objectives are to be achieved:</p>
<p>1) Conduct various types of special studies required throughout the program cycle;</p>
<p>2) Support and/or provide services to the Mission's staff as well as implementing partners (IPs) and/or stakeholders to ensure appropriate use of empirical data and evidence to improve programming at all levels; and</p>
<p>3) Meaningfully engage and strengthen capacity of USAID/Central Asia, relevant partners/stakeholders as well as local organizations and/or individual experts in relation to research, evaluation, and use of empirical data to improve development programming.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this Contract will assist the Mission and its partners and stakeholders to generate empirical data as well as foster learning and knowledge management through a participatory process in order to support stronger results and improve evidence-based programming. This, in turn, will promote more effective use of the Agency's development assistance resources and provide greater transparency.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, New Jersey, in support of U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Weapons &amp; Software Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is currently seeking sources for a Multi-Role/domain Armament System.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought. In preparation for possible future procurement(s), ACC-NJ is performing this Sources Sought to explore companies capable of developing turret systems that are compatible with Medium to Large Caliber Weapon systems (50mm to 120mm) and for integration onto armored fighting vehicle platforms. ARDEC is interested in exploring the market capability to support such an effort.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>The ARDEC objectives are intended to assess (through a trade study) the following aspects: elevation ranges of weapon(s) performance, fire control sensor complexity and needs, cost, integration impacts (crew space, size, weight, power requirements), autonomous operation capability to include integration of autoloader technologies for the range of weapon systems capable, threats that can be addressed, accuracies that can be achieved, and flexibility as a common turret to support a multi-role/multi-domain armament system.</p>
<p>The results of these planned assessments will aid ARDEC's determination of optimal turret for a potential follow-on effort to demonstrate the accuracy and lethality of the multi-role/multi-domain Armament systems on a vehicle platform. The U.S. Government resourcing for potential future demonstrations has not been identified to date. For the potential follow-on demonstrations, the Government will be responsible for providing the weapon systems, test facilities, ammunition, and available expertise to allow for live fire testing.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government prefers technical data disclosure, and subsequent partnering, with U.S. based companies. Non-U.S. nationals, or those representing non-U.S. industries, must consider how to address data export restrictions. ARDEC is open to discussions with foreign industry representatives with the understanding that the material and technical data disclosed would be limited to open source information and no sensitive or classified information will be discussed.<br />Interested parties shall submit an informational paper and brief capability statement, demonstrating how they are capable of meeting these objectives. The informational paper should address turret description to include internal components, photos and the technical feasibility and modifications required (if an existing turret is proposed). Standard corporate brochures are not desired. The capability statement should include the following: company name, address, telephone number, email address, technical point of contract, DUNS number, Cage Code and company size (please specify as either a Large Business, Foreign-Owned Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concern, Woman-Owned Small Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone concern, Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Service-Disabled Small Business) and relevant expertise, facilities and experience in weapons systems and fire control integration.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This is not a solicitation. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this sources sought. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. Information provided will not be returned. The Government will accept questions.<br /><br />The Army is not seeking, and will not accept, unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government is not responsible and will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice.<br /><br />All submissions are requested to be made within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of this publication, via electronic mail to Jonathan Kilgore, email: jonathan.m.kilgore.civ@mail.mil. NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<DESC>Title of Project: Public Health Support Services for ATSDR Public Health Assessment Activities<br />Introduction: This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541690 with a size standard of $15M dollars.<br />Background. This procurement is entitled "Public Health Support Services for ATSDR Public Health Assessment Activities". The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) was created under Sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended by Section 110 (P.L. 99-499) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). ATSDR was created to implement the health-related sections of CERCLA as amended by SARA.<br />Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of this indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)contract is to facilitate the procurement of regularly and repeatedly scientific, technical, expert, and logistical services (e.g. outreach and education services) for ATSDR in support of its public health mission with regards to public health assessment activities such as, but not limited to, public health assessments, public health consultations, exposure investigations, biomonitoring activities, health studies, training, and related outreach, education, and evaluation activities. <br />ATSDR public health assessments, health consultations, and other Agency activities are mechanisms to respond to community and public health concerns associated with human exposure to hazardous and/or industrial substances at sites and projects. Public health assessments, health consultations, and other ATSDR activities evaluate and oftentimes collect relevant environmental and biological data, health outcome data, and community and public concerns associated with a site where hazardous and/or industrial substances have been released. The public health assessment process identifies populations living or working on or near hazardous waste and/or industrial release sites and determines which public health actions are warranted, such as, but not limited to, public health assessments and consultations, exposure investigations and biomonitoring activities, emergency response, technical assists, health studies, public participation and education, and chemical-specific studies and evaluations. ATSDR, where warranted, may evaluate current, past, and/or future exposure to hazardous waste and/or industrial substances to communities living near hazardous waste/industrial release sites. <br />The community associated with a site can be broadly defined as the population(s) living around the site/project and all others who can provide or disseminate relevant information on that site/project during the public health assessment process. The involved community may include individual residents living near the site or organized community/public groups and their representatives. Contacting populations living around the site and interacting with community-based organizations allows for awareness of community/public health concerns and for obtaining other relevant site information. <br />Scope of Work. The unique nature, scope, and complexity of the scientific, technical, expert, operational, and logistical services needed to support ATSDR's public health assessment activities will vary from site to site and project to project. Some public health assessment activities may be completed within 12 months whereas other public health assessment activities may require several years to complete. Project/site support may include, but not be limited to, the following activities: data gathering, evaluation, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination, environmental and biological sampling and monitoring and evaluation, data quality control and assurance, analysis, consultation, report preparation, training, and general and public logistical coordination. <br />Areas of expertise needed to supplement existing agency efforts are classified in the "Statement of Work" as "Expert and Scientific Assistance" and "Technical Assistance" and may include, but not be limited to, such diverse skills and expertise in the following areas: demographics, computer programming for public health assessment purposes, instructional design/technology, graphic design/artistry, statistics, mathematics, environmental and biological modeling, geographic information systems technology, medicine, physiology, engineering (chemical, environmental, industrial, process, mechanical), ecology, geology, hydro-geology, chemistry, health physics, biology, epidemiology, toxicology, environmental science, laboratory science, veterinary science, environmental and biological sampling/monitoring, biomonitoring, meteorology, economics, nutrition, soil science, health education, health risk communication, training, research, program evaluation and decision making, public relations, writing and editing, case study development, distance learning applications, web-delivered health assessment training, conference planning, and administration and clerical.<br />Often, in response to unpredicted events or public concerns, project/site priorities may change. These unpredicted changes, along with existing and planned projects, lead to fluctuating requirements for expert, scientific, technical, operational and logistical consultant services. Because the timing and level of effort cannot be entirely predicted, the work plan, skills, expertise, and deliverables required of the Contractor may fluctuate during the year and from year to year. Emergency and other unforeseen events may also require additional Contractor support. Therefore, the ATSDR Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), with the CDC/ATSDR Contracting Officer's (CO) approval, may add projects and sites to work requests throughout the year and from year to year. In addition, the COR, with CO approval, may modify targets, deliverables, work requests, and funding distributions, depending on the availability of site/project information and priorities of ATSDR.<br />Technical Requirements. Within the two general areas of support, the Contractor may be required to perform the types of tasks listed below. Performance of all areas of support and tasks may be required concurrently on multiple projects, sites, and tasks. Contractor personnel may be required travel to accomplish project/site activities. Although the successful Contractor will be expected to provide all services ultimately listed in the SOW, it is not expected that the successful Contractor(s) will have the capabilities to perform all of the required services included in the scope of work for this acquisition. Therefore, the Government anticipates that subcontracting for some limited services (e.g. laboratory services, expert panel members, highly specialized expertise) may be necessary.
<p>A. Expert and Scientific Assistance<br />ATSDR requires expert and scientific assistance in its mission to prevent exposure and adverse human health effects and diminished quality of life associated with exposure to hazardous substances from waste sites, industrial releases, unplanned releases, and other sources of pollution present in the environment. Examples of such assistance include, but are not limited to, the evaluation of data and information on the release of hazardous/industrial substances into the environment to assess any past, current, or future impact on public health, and identify actions needed to evaluate and mitigate or prevent human health effects. Contractor required expert and scientific assistance shall be, but not limited to, advice, consultation, development, evaluation, analysis, reporting, and interpretation of environmental public health issues using scientific knowledge, methodology, principles, and practices approved by ATSDR.</p>
<p>More specifically, the following are the core components that the Contractor may be requested by the Government to undertake in performance of scientific and expert assistance:</p>
<p>1. Analyze, interpret, and evaluate environmental, biological, chemical, radiological, and health data, selecting and using the best science, techniques, and standards most appropriate to the problem at hand. Assist ATSDR in development of standard operating procedures and guidance materials.

Evaluate and interpret toxicological information and literature to assess adverse health outcomes resulting from exposure to toxic substances. Follow current analytical or interpretive methods, as described by ATSDR's Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual while using the Public Health Assessment Site Tool (PHAST), or as directed by ATSDR.</p>
<p>5. Provide epidemiologic support for analysis of health outcome data (cancer registries, etc). Consult with and advise ATSDR on design and analysis of studies and investigations to determine potential associations between toxic exposures and adverse health outcomes (planning through execution and evaluation).</p>
<p>6. Design, execute, and evaluate outreach and education activities in communities that will inform all appropriate parties about the health risks from exposure to hazardous/industrial release substances and provide preventive actions.</p>
<p>7. Provide expert statistical, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation support for evaluation of data and methodology as needed.</p>
<p>8. Provide national and international experts versed in tasks listed in this statement of work.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is issued as a means of conducting market research to determine if other companies, besides General Electric Aviation (GE), are capable of providing performance-based logistics (PBL) support for the TF34 Engine Platform. The TF34 powers the USAF A-10 Warthog aircraft. The proposed contract action is for PBL support for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to support the objectives by responding to this notice. All responses received by the notice response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received in response to this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether do conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>The Government desires a PBL provider to enter into a partnership to include supply support, demand/planning forecasting, material management, engineering support and sustainment elements, packaging, storage/warehousing, reliability improvements, and field customer service/engineering support of the TF34 Engine manufactured by General Electric (GE) Aircraft Engines, and the associated TF34 Bill of Materials (BOM) of DLA managed consumable parts to support United States Air Force (USAF) customers. The contract is anticipated to be Requirements-type, Firm Fixed Price Contract, with a five-year base period, and 1, five-year option period.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES: The overarching objectives of this acquisition are to: (1) decrease TF34 Engine repair delays due to outstanding consumable requirements, and fill requisitions within material availability priorities; and (2) accelerate the Fleet Readiness Center South East engine and engine component repair turnaround time through enhanced material availability. In order to meet these objectives, the contractor must have the ability to drive changes into the weapons system configuration and, more importantly, understand, analyze, and assess the implications-both in terms of performance and operational usage-of any potential configuration change.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to aggregate all material requirements in order to leverage the best value for material support. The contractor will be required to deliver their supplies utilizing a Supplier Initiated Ordering process that pushes material into the DLA system to satisfy demands while significantly reducing DLA's inventory investment. The contractor shall be responsible for forecasting, acquiring, stocking, and fulfilling requirements via its commercial operation/facility utilized to meet contract requirements. In addition to filling material requirements, the contractor is required to make recommendations for Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) along with being responsible for obsolescence management and mitigating Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMSMS) challenges for the TF34 Bill of Materials (BOM).</p>
<p>Performance metrics associated with this acquisition may be tied to local DLA-A Jacksonville to FRC-SE Navy Retail Fill Rate (NRFR) and DLA (worldwide customers) material availability. Small business participation will also be a metric. Reliability improvements, and backorder management are also potential metrics.</p>
<p>The contract will allow for an expansion of support based on developing and evolving TF34 Engine requirements from DLA and/or USAF.</p>
<p>RESPONSES: The Government requires that only non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for the use of any proprietary information submitted.</p>

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) <br />OPO-18-RFI-000001-Passive Cooling Techniques and Systems</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY in accordance with FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP or Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). This RFI does not commit the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) to contract for any supply or service. DHS S&amp;T is not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the S&amp;T will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or BAA. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the S&amp;T. All submissions become the property of S&amp;T, and will not be returned.</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND/PROGRAM DESCRIPTION<br />DHS S&amp;T is seeking information on developed passive cooling techniques and systems capable of stabilizing temperatures in unmanned facilities, and is issuing this RFI to determine availability, capability, and maturity of these systems.</p>
<p>2. PROBLEM STATEMENT/REQUIREMENTS <br />Passive Cooling Definition. DHS S&amp;T defines passive cooling as an approach that stabilizes interior temperature of a building through heat gain control and heat dissipation with low or no energy consumption. DHS S&amp;T will test and evaluate facility prototype's capability to provide passive cooling to continuously stabilize temperature of electronic equipment at or below 100oF during day / night cycle.</p>
<p>Notional Facility Characteristics. The facility will: a) be unmanned, but remotely monitored; b) be 10' x 10' x 10' in length, width and height; c) be sited in austere, geographically-remote desert areas; d) be in an environment where the hottest days reach ~120oF and drop to 86oF at night. [During hot season, average daily temperature difference between day and night was 25oF]; and e) house electronic equipment that is expected to generate roughly 10.0 kilowatt-hours of heat 24-hours-a-day.</p>
<p>General Characteristics. DHS S&amp;T requests you provide information on your technique and/or systems general capabilities and attributes, and your company information, guided by the following questions, and include any known or expected issues and limitations. The following questions pertain to your passive cooling technique and/or system for a building.<br />&bull; Approach. What is your approach for heat gain control and heat dissipation? For example, what modalities does your approach use, i.e. conduction, convection, radiation, or a mixture?<br />&bull; Environment Pre-Requisites. Is your approach optimized for facility cooling applications for remote, arid, desert conditions? Is water availability (limited or unlimited) required for your system to work? <br />&bull; Weather Volatility Effects. Does wind, rain, fog, or cloud cover degrade the effectiveness of your approach?<br />&bull; Materials. What materials are required by your approach? Do materials require special fabrication, long lead-time, or are they Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)? For example, does your approach use special materials, e.g. graphene with high thermal conductivity and high emissivity, or anhydrous ammonia heat pipes?<br />&bull; Above/Below Ground Facility. Is the system buried or above ground? If buried, what is a typical depth and how do soil or freeze/thaw cycle and other conditions affect the system? Are there any other specific burial requirements for the system? <br />&bull; Special Skills or Licenses. What techniques, skills, or licenses/permits are required to implement your approach? For example: a) design and construction will involve masonry, brick-laying, concrete formwork, crane operation, digging or drilling, geo-thermal engineering, heating-ventilation and air conditioning, mechanical engineering; or b) advanced science will involve nanotechnology fabrication or top-down plasma etching?<br />&bull; Temperature Monitoring. Will your system operate without monitoring? Can the user monitor and control the temperature conditions of your cooling system in-place or remotely?<br />&bull; Test Results. Do you have any internal or independent test results? <br />&bull; System Specifications/Drawings. What is the format for blueprints or material fabrication standards that will be used to make the system?<br />&bull; Company History. Is this an existing technology or only a technology concept? If it is an existing technology, how long has your company's product been on the market?<br />&bull; Market Stability. Have there been sales or installations of your system? To whom? Where? <br />&bull; Intellectual Property. Are there any company patents or Intellectual Property restrictions regarding the system?</p>
<p>Detailed Characteristics. The Notional Facility Characteristics described above should serve as a reference for answering following questions.<br />&bull; Approach Efficiency. How much more energy efficient is your approach than using a typical window air conditioner to cool interior temperature of a 1,000 cubic foot building in kilowatt-hours per day?<br />&bull; Scale. Could your system be reduced in scale to a smaller sized building than notional facility described above to house electronic equipment?<br />&bull; Maintainability. What is the Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) for your system?<br />&bull; Estimated Cost. How much will your system cost for the notional facility described above.</p>

<DESC><br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).&nbsp;<br /><br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /><br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.<br /><br />The Open Period for <strong>DECEMBER</strong> is DECEMBER 1, 2017 to DECEMBER 7, 2017, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.<br /><br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.<br /><br />DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG02 and must be located within Region 2.
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.<br /><br />Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.<br /><br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement, a market survey for information to be used for preliminary planning purposes. This notice serves a twofold purpose: 1) To issue a Sources Sought notice and 2) To announce Industry Forum for Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) for CFM Central Region.
The Industry Forum is intended to provide background and general information on MACC and will be used for market research to give the Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) the opportunity to engage contractors to determine overall interest. The Industry Forum is scheduled for December 15, 2017 from 9:00 AM until 12:00 PM at the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center, 3001 Green Bay Road, Bldg. 134, Rm. C108, North Chicago, IL  60064.  Parking is limited and attendees are encouraged to carpool.
Sources Sought: Attendance to the Industry Forum is not mandatory; however, submissions of your Sources Sought Information Forms are strongly encouraged. All responses to the sources sought must be submitted via email to the Contracting Officer, Scott Hurst at scott.hurst2@va.gov by January 4, 2018, 2:00 pm CST. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). At this time a solicitation does not exist.
CFM is seeking Center for Veteran Enterprises Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) certified and listed in the Vendor Information Pages.  Additionally, the VA is seeking interested businesses that are U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) Businesses, SBA certified HUBZone Small Businesses, and/or Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses.
The companies must be listed in the System for Award Management (SAM) with a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 236220 with a small business size standard of $36.5 million.  The small business firm must be capable of self-performing at least 15% of the work.
The term self-perform refers to performing relevant major trade work in-house without subcontractors. This does not include administrative or management functions. Relevant major trade work is that which is the same or similar to the work that may be ordered under the proposed contract.
The information received will be used by CFM to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency.
This Sources Sought Synopsis is one facet in the Governments overall market research in regard to whether the proposed solicitation will be issued as a competitive set-aside or as full and open (unrestricted).
The procurement strategy will not be determined based solely on the information received in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.
No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this market research.
Interested parties are advised that in accordance with the Veterans First Contracting program under 38 U.S.C. 8127-8128, as implemented under VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) subpart 819.70 and VA Procurement Policy Memorandum 2016-05 Implementation of the Veterans First Contracting Program, if the Contracting Officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more small business concerns owned and controlled by Service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns will submit responses to the solicitation and that award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers the best value to the United States, the requirement will be set-aside for SDVOSB concerns. If an SDVOSB set-aside is not appropriate, the requirement will be evaluated to determine whether a Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) set-aside is appropriate. The term SDVOSB / VOSB under the Veterans First Contracting program has the same meaning as defined in FAR subpart 2.101, except for acquisitions authorized by 38 U.S.C. 8127 and 8128 for the Veterans First Contracting Program SDVOSB and VOSB concerns must be listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov  in addition to meeting the NAICS code small business size standard to be eligible for award under Veterans First Contracting Program set-asides.
The proposed IDIQ contract will be for a base and four option periods. The estimated total contract price for the DBB MACC is $25M per contractor ($5M base plus four $5M options). Task order range is estimated between $300K and $3M. VA intends to award a minimum of five contracts.
Interested sources are invited to respond to this sources sought announcement by using the forms provided under separate file titled: Sources Sought Information Form. Submissions of forms are strongly encouraged.

The system s LatticeFX  technology or scaffolding orients cell adhesion and extracellular deposition, enabling early homeostasis with reduced flow across the neck of aneurysms.4,5 The nylon and PGLA fibers enlaced into the coils enhance thrombin generation, which results in a much higher occlusion rate, and the risk of thromboembolic events is kept to a minimum.6 These second-generation, filament-containing coils provide higher flow resistance (reduced cross-neck flow velocity) imparted by the distribution of filament in the vessel,7 potentially decreasing the time to achieve vascular occlusion. An in vitro study showed that the addition of nylon and PGLA filaments to bare platinum coils increases the thrombogenicity of the coil.8 The clinical importance of the latter finding is underscored by studies that have shown that bare platinum coils  failure rates are not insignificant. For example, Kuo et al demonstrated a 14% re-bleeding rate after super selective embolization for the treatment of lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage,9 and Deshaies et al found a 33% aneurysm recurrence rate at 1 year after treatment with bare platinum coils.10

The Concerto  detachable coil system can be carefully placed and remain attached until the coil configuration and secure positioning are acceptable, minimizing the risk of coil migration and nontarget embolization. These coils have robust double polypropylene strands that confer superior stretch resistance, which not only enables responsive placement and repositioning, but also minimizes coil stretching even during extensive repositioning. Furthermore, there is no time limit on coil placement. The system s freely rotating ball-and-socket mechanism with a unique floating eyelet enables an instant detachment of the coil, allowing its full deployment in a desired location before release. The ability to reliably place and reposition the coils provides immense benefits in clinical practice, especially when dealing with high-flow vascular beds and precarious anatomy

DRAFT Statement of Work

Introduction
Purpose
Censitrac is a Dental and Medical-Surgical instrument and reusable medical equipment (RME) tracking solution developed by Censis Technologies, Inc. (Censis). Censitrac has been installed in multiple Veteran Integrated System Network (VISN) VA Medical Centers (VAMCs). All instruments require a 2-dimensional data matrix that uniquely identifies the instrument. The marking or stencil is applied by a marking station supplied by Censis and then details about the instrument are entered into the Censitrac database. As the instrument travels through the sterilization process, the electrochemical mark is scanned such that the instrument can be tracked through the process. Some instruments cannot be marked based on chemical, surface, electromagnetic, or material characteristics of which the instruments are made and these instruments are instead supplementary marked with a  dot  or  tape  which contains a pre-printed 2D matrix barcode on a small surface with a semi-permanent adhesive backing. These supplementary dots/tapes withstand repeat sterilizations without adverse effect.
VISN 02 desires to initiate/complete the implementation of their Censis System with completion of marking and commissioning services for their instrument inventory.  This Task Order (TO) establishes the requirements for the scope of services required for VISN 02 and its facilities (See Section 6.0) to finalize all marking and commissioning of dental and medical-surgical instruments utilizing VA developed data standards and guidance. 
Scope of Work - Marking & Commissioning (M&C) Services
Tracking enhances the ability of VA to mitigate human factor concerns while ensuring world-class patient care and staff safety by providing assurances that instruments have been fully processed in accordance with regulatory guidelines and individual instrument manufacturer s Instructions for Use (IFU) for reusable medical equipment (RME) and dental/medical-surgical instrumentation.
The VA desires that the Marking & Commissioning (M&C) service offering enhance Sterile Processing Service (SPS) business processes and support SPS staff responsible for tracking, cleaning and distributing reusable medical equipment throughout the medical facility by automating the traceability of tasks, instruments, and supplies.   The following table contains SPS-specific requirements:

Req. ID
Requirement
MC001
Vendor will review, provide constructive feedback, approve, and pre-populate the system with the site s medical/surgical and dental instrument data, providing access to the Censis Master Library as necessary for the effort.
MC002
Ensures proper placement and application of 2D matrix mark by either electrochemical or manual (e.g. 2D matrix dot/tape) processes. Placement will not impede clinician s use, nor subject any risk to the Veteran patient.
MC003
QA of applied mark ensures that the matrix is scannable by the Censitrac system within a maximum of three (3) seconds.
MC004
Enter data into Censitrac dataset in strict accordance with the RTLS Sterile Processing Workflow (SPW) data standards (specifically DS018, DS019, and DS020); while qualifying as needed via the current version of VA RTLS Medical-Surgical and Dental Instrument Nomenclature Guidance.
MC005
The vendor shall create/provide tray count sheets utilizing 2D matrix scanning to readily identify instrument inventory of each set.
MC006
Commissioning QA: Vendor s PM/technical staff will analyze the data entries and apply VAs National Naming Convention/Data Standards and Data Quality Tool (DQT) to all of the records, ensuring 100% compliance with the standards PRIOR to submission to VA for review/acceptance. 
MC006.1
Data Quality Tool (DQT) new terms derived during the commissioning effort will be submitted to the VA COR/RTLS SPW Workgroup for processing and actions/approval within five (5) business days of cessation of M&C. 
MC006.2
Vendor will provide any necessary data remediation within three (3) business days of receipt from VA.
MC007
Vendor will provide at the close of each workday an e-report, capturing daily marking and commissioning activity for VA COR review.
MC008
Vendor will meet regularly (not less than weekly) with the COR to present and review progress to date, discuss constraints, project schedule, consumables (stencils, etc.) on hand, availability of instruments, and estimate number/types of instruments remaining to be marked.

Under this TO the Contractor shall utilize the Censitrac software which serves as the VHA s nationwide surgical/medical and dental instrument inventory and workflow system. The contractor will mark, fully commission all required data fields, and build instrument set count sheets as designated for assigned dental, medical-surgical instruments, and RME within each facility. Count Sheet creation will take place at the time of tray disassembly for marking/commissioning by the Contractor. Estimations of need are derived from site complexity levels for the provision of marks, commissioning, and type of stencils (i.e., standard or small).
As part of this effort, the Contractor shall conduct requisite site assessments, mark and commission instruments, perform quality assurance testing, perform data validation, and load data standard-compliant data into the new system. 
Marking Methods for Instrument Tracking System (ITS) Application
Some VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) are encountering challenges related to appropriate determination of approved methods for marking medical/surgical instruments upon implementation of the ITS application. Dental and Medical/Surgical instruments are capable of being marked to facilitate unique device identification,  owner,  and applicable tray assignment. Instruments should never be engraved or adulterated in any way that violates the protective passivation layer.
After performing an extensive review of marking methods, the Sterile Processing Workflow (SPW) Workgroup (WG) has determined that a goal of 100% instrument marking is not currently achievable due to a small subgroup of special surface characteristics (i.e. curved, knurled, titanium, etc.). Two primary methods were identified that meet the established National Program Office for Sterile Processing (NPOSP) goals:
Dimensional (2D) Data Matrix 
This GS1-standard format is an internationally recognized marking tool designed to be read by a handheld or fixed  reader  integrated into the Instrument Tracking System (ITS). This VHA-standardized solution is suitable for workflow traceability and is currently being deployed to all VA Medical Centers as the primary (preferred/cost-effective) solution. 
2D Data Matrix Instrument Marking Tape/ Dots 
Any tape/dot utilized for this purpose MUST be utilized in full accordance with AAMI guidelines and the manufacturer s instructions for use. The tape/dot matrix manufacturer s instructions should be reviewed to verify which sterilants are capable of tape penetration, as not all types of tape/dot matrix may be used for all sterilization methods or for high-level disinfection. 
NOTE: RME devices that lend themselves to the use of instrument tapes, dots, and/or RFID are those non-OR items that, due to special exceptions, are incapable of being marked with GS1-standard 2D data matrices, including but certainly not limited to the following RME:
Comprised of Aluminum, Titanium, etc. 
Diamond or Linear Knurled Handles
ENT/Neuro Instruments
Rounded Items (e.g.: Dental, etc.)
Small/Fine/Delicate Instruments
Beginning Instrument Marking and Commissioning 
The vendor is required to mark and commission approximately 100% of agreed instrumentation, The COR and local SPS Chief will closely monitor the status of sets completed against lists provided to vendor.
Facilities will have to work closely with the vendor to ensure that as much instrumentation as possible is provided each day (typically a minimum of 200 instruments per marking team member per day). While OR daily operational needs may exceed availability, the vendor(s) must stay on schedule. Coordination between SPS, OR, CBOCs, Clinics, and vendor are essential to a successful deployment.
Matrix Estimations
The ITS vendor will consider the following VA stencil estimation table, which was produced utilizing legacy ITS site data in 2013 and reaffirmed in late 2014:

VHA Medical Center Complexity Levels
Current Surgical Instrument Quantity Ranges (2014)
Recommended ITS Stencil Start Count*

NOTE: * Facility is strongly encouraged to consider placing an additional order with sufficient lead time to maintain operations (30-day production time from date order is received by vendor)

. The Contracting Officer (and/or Contracting Officer s Representative (COR)) understand(s) that complexity level 1A sites are limited to 50,000 stencils per quarter to prevent over-procurement, thus surpassing actual facility requirements.
Preliminary Activities
The facility count sheets will be provided by the facility for the vendor to review. Upon acceptance, vendor will pre-load the Censitrac software with the site s RME, medical/surgical, and dental instrument data and provide access to the library. This data will be utilized to commission items and subsequently produce Count Sheets for the Operating Room, CBOC s, and for other reporting purposes. Marking and commissioning may begin while count sheet preparations are underway. 
INSTRUMENTATION NOMENCLATURE 
Due to software constraints, the individual instrument descriptions in the Product Name fields are generally limited to 50 characters within Censitrac. The key data attributes that must adhere to the VA RTLS Data Standards (e.g. DS018, DS019, DS020) and the current version of VA RTLS Medical-Surgical and Dental Instrument Nomenclature Guidance (See Section 5). The following provides a general overview:
Supplier: Generally the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or primary U.S. vendor of the medical/surgical or dental instrumentation/device. 
The  Master List  is stored on the RTLS SharePoint and maintained by the VA RTLS SPW WG within the VA RTLS SPW Gold Standard Instrument Library Elements (MS Excel Workbook). 
Additional reference materials are available within the VA RTLS Medical-Surgical and Dental Instrument Nomenclature Standard Guidance stored on the RTLS SharePoint and maintained by the VA RTLS SPW WG.
Contractor will work with VA to support these field's data maintenance for the length of the contract/agreement(s).
Contractor to submit data for VA review in a site-specific MS Excel workbook.
ALL Vendor Names are recorded and submitted to VA in "ALL CAPS" format.
An initial list of Vendor Names was provided by Censis to the VA RTLS SPW WG for incorporation into this data standard. VA has purchased local subscriptions for Censitrac's long-term support and data maintenance. As new Vendor Names are added or received by Contractor from VA sites, routine updates and revisions to the field's Vendor Names will be provided to the VA RTLS SPW WG for review. Data submitted with missing or incorrect information will delay incorporation/completion. 
Contractor will provide the VA RTLS SPW WG with regular (monthly) notifications of new Vendor Names via submission of an electronic list (MS Excel) for workgroup review and incorporation into the VA RTLS SPW Gold Standard Instrument Library Elements (MS Excel Workbook) on the VA RTLS SharePoint.

Catalog Number: This is the number electrochemically marked onto the side of the medical/surgical instrument by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).
If this number is NOT present or illegible, please see below for guidance regarding the need for  priority replacement  of these items.
As each manufacturer/vendor maintains their own 'proprietary' data format, a MASTER list is not currently feasible.
The VA  Master List  will be stored on the RTLS SharePoint and maintained by the VA RTLS SPW WG within the VA RTLS SPW Gold Standard Instrument Library Elements (MS Excel Workbook). 
Additional reference materials are available within the VA RTLS Medical-Surgical and Dental Instrument Nomenclature Standard Guidance stored on the RTLS SharePoint and maintained by the VA RTLS SPW WG.
Contractor will support this field's data maintenance for the length of the contract/agreement(s).
Contractor will submit data for VA review in a site-specific MS Excel workbook.
Due to the wide variations of catalog reference number formats (Use of VarChar, Leading Zeros, Special Characters, etc.), this section will not be formally standardized beyond general guidance at this time.
ALL data will be recorded and submitted to VA in "ALL CAPS" format and parsed with special characters in place as exhibited on the actual RME item or catalog.
Data values will not be altered (truncated) in the production system by removing any special characters (referred to as "condensing" the data). The value that is exhibited on the instrument (or in the catalog) is the value that will be stored in the database.
Contractor may condense (truncate) the data to conduct data validation efforts with Censis, but VA delivered data will match that exhibited on the instrument (or in the catalog). Data submitted to VA for review/acceptance will include any special characters as exhibited on the instrument (or in the catalog).
Contractor will provide the VA RTLS SPW WG with regular (monthly) notifications of new Catalog Numbers via submission of an electronic list (MS Excel) for workgroup review and incorporation into the VA RTLS SPW Gold Standard Instrument Library Elements (MS Excel Workbook) on the VA RTLS SharePoint.

Items With Illegible Or No Manufacturer Or Catalog Numbers 
Items that present without any easily identifiable marks (i.e. Catalog/Reference Number) will be considered for immediate removal and/or replacement by the facility.
Compliance with manufacturer s IFUs cannot be applied without 100% certainty of device identification.
Expedited replacement direction was provided directly to the VA RTLS PMO from the VHA National Program Office for Sterile Processing (NPOSP).
If a suitable backup instrument is available, the unmarked instrument should be expeditiously programmed for replacement.
Any critically required  no-mark  instruments (those items without which will adversely impact the delivery of quality patient care) may be retained for use while a replacement is urgently procured.
This includes any floor grade (e.g.  Pakistani ) instrumentation that is identified within OR surgical trays.
NOTE: VA s goal is to remove medical/surgical and dental instruments from service that present without any readable OEM surface markings. Through the course of the day based on the discovery of an illegible manufacturer/part number, the vendor will clearly communicate and provide VA with medical/surgical and dental instruments which require decision and/or action by SPS personnel. The enhanced process steps are as follows: 
All medical/surgical and dental instruments that meet the criteria (e.g. material and size requirements) for marking will be 2D electrochemically marked and commissioned. The standards for the key data entry fields and are as follows:
Supplier field:
If the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) cannot be readily determined, HPES/Sites will utilize  NVN  (No Vendor Name)
 Catalog Number field:
If the Catalog Number cannot be readily determined, HPES/Sites will utilize  NMN  (No Model Number) plus
After entering  NMN  will Barcode Scan the 10-digit Stencil ID into the  Catalog Number  Field
Result: (example)  NMN1234567890 
These values should be utilized to ensure adherence to the data standards, limiting human factors related to data entry, and to assist in reporting purposes while procuring a replacement. 
Facility SPS Chief will utilize the  NVM  and  NMN  references to monitor the expedited replacement and for required NPOSP reporting purposes.
HPES/Censis will ensure that reporting of  Same Stencil ID & Catalog Number  is an established report available to the VISN and the local SPS Chief upon activation of the software.
All medical/surgical and dental instruments that were marked per the above procedure without a legible supplier or part number will be sequestered (e.g. bagged) and placed back into its respective tray/set. SPS staff will be notified to determine which medical/surgical and dental instruments should be considered for decommissioning and/or replacement. SPS will review the affected medical/surgical and dental instruments and take any necessary actions in accordance with the established expectations.
Data Quality and Reporting
These requirements dictate that marked instruments will be 100% accurately identified BY THE VENDOR (not VA SPS staff), data entered (also known as  commissioned ) into the Censitrac database, with all necessary quality controls in place to meet VA s nomenclature standards and guidance (See Section 5).
The Vendor will follow the following process for physical (mark) quality and item identification assurance. 
Post 2D electrochemical mark applications, the vendor will immediately QA the item to ensure it scans easily into the Censitrac system. Marks that do not read within 2-3 seconds will be assessed for re-application prior to commissioning.
VA SPS staff will perform QA on the vendor-performed work on a Censitrac workstation, which permits access to the instrument database. This access will allow VA staff to evaluate the quality of the mark and that the instrument scanned is the one displayed in Censitrac and the data is in strict accordance with VA Data Standards. It s important that the standardized product name corresponds to the instrument being scanned. The QA of the instrument name is described below. 
QA will be performed by the vendor in accordance with the following schedule:
Weeks 1-2: The facility SPS staff will perform manual and automated QA checks on not less than 15% of vendor throughput of medical/surgical instrumentation, containers, and applicable RME. The checks must be annotated and forwarded to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) on a daily basis.
Weeks 3+: The facility SPS staff will perform manual and automated QA checks on not less than 10% of vendor throughput of medical/surgical instrumentation, containers, and applicable RME. The QA checks must be annotated and forwarded to the COR on a weekly basis for the remainder of the contract,
The QA effort will be recorded and submitted to the COR in an electronic format since aggregate results will need to be analyzed to measure contractor performance. The QA document will be reviewed by the VA SPS POC and submitted to the COR daily/weekly per the above requirements.
The VISN COR will aggregate and act upon vendor QA results as necessary to measure contractor performance and ensure VA receives product deliverable in full applicability to these requirements.
Both VA and the contractor will continue to monitor and improve upon these activities.
Upon marking and commissioning of a site s instruments, the vendor will provide a consolidated list to the facility for review, to include any 'new' Data Quality Tool (DQT) (described in section 6.3) reference table terms which will be reviewed by the VA team. The QA list will be available to the VA for review/processing within 48 hours after each days marking and commissioning activities. The VA will be able to perform up to 100% quality assurance checks on the instrument names.
New Terms
The VA has developed the aforementioned Data Quality Tool to provide enterprise assurances that all data added to a new Censitrac system meets the conventional data standards as described within the current version of the VA RTLS Medical-Surgical and Dental Instrument Nomenclature Guidance.
Vendor will access the most recent DQT from the RTLS SharePoint or upon request from the COR.
The vendor will follow the DQT directions to load the new site s data for quality testing.
Any errors will be reviewed/corrected by the vendor. 
For outstanding errors that cannot be immediately remediated by the vendor, or are otherwise known  new  terms that need to be evaluated, these will be saved within the DQT and forwarded to the VA COR for processing by the VA RTLS SPW Workgroup.
Upon receipt of VA feedback/approval - vendor will load the approved terms to the DQT Reference Table and provide any necessary data remediation within three (3) business days of receipt from VA.
The revised DQT (Master) will be returned to VA COR/SPW WG and/or uploaded by vendor to the VA SharePoint.
HPE will submit the final VISN SPW Data document (in DQT format) to the COR for local approval
Vendor will do this at no additional charge to VA as QA is an inherent function of the commissioning charge.
VA retains all rights to the DQT and its future use beyond the vendor s contract Period of Performance (PoP).
Additional Requirements
  The preferred successful vendor will be certified by Censis indicating appropriate training and quality control for marking and commissioning services. Vendor certification by Censis may require costs to the vendor associated with any certification process.
  Stencils may be acquired from Censis using the unique numbering system developed for and/or partially implemented at each VA facility.
  The contractor shall provide unique stencil numbers.  The solution shall not allow duplicate numbers within the entire VA system.  VA currently utilizes an alphanumeric nomenclature to identify their assets and instruments (example:  528A4-EE12345, where  528A4  is the station number and  123456  is the unique identification number for the instrument).   The list of facilities under this scope is provided on the following SharePoint site, with their designated station numbers, which can be used to populate the table in Section 6: https://vaww.vha.vaco.portal.va.gov/sites/DUSHOM/HTM/RTLS/Lists/Facility_Directory/All%20Items.aspx 
  The successful vendor will coordinate access to instruments for marking and commissioning with the Sterile Processing Service (SPS) Chief at each facility, in such a manner as to minimize disruption to patient care and to minimize the period of time required to complete marking and commissioning. It is the expectation that the vendor will schedule any necessary work during timeframes when the items are in less demand by the OR, Clinics, etc., to include evenings, nights, and/or weekends (as applicable). Coordination between SPS, Operating Room (OR), Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC), and Hospital based clinical departments (from here on knows as Clinics), and the Vendor is essential to a successful deployment. VA facilities are prepared to monitor and strategically plan around the  OR Block  and clinic treatment schedules to most efficiently permit the vendor access to medical/surgical and dental instruments while not impacting patient care. The vendor is hereby clearly informed by VA that the work to be performed may NOT be possible during normal business hours.
  Instruments will be marked with the appropriate Censitrac marking workstation and consumables supplied by the VA . 
  Upon approval, the new terms will be added to the DQT reference tables according to the process outlined below:
Vendor will prepare all SPW data in strict accordance with VA RTLS Data Standard 020 (Section 5) and will forward any concerns to the COR.
Vendor will propose any new marking terms to the COR for review/approval within 5 business days of completion of instrument marking at the VA facility.
The COR will provide concurrence or feedback via email on items to be addressed/clarified by the vendor within 5 business days. For specific items to be addressed by vendor, the vendor will resubmit responses within 48 hours to those items in questions for VA concurrence as applicable.
The Vendor will update the data quality tool reference tables with the newly accepted marking terms for VA use.
When all of the initial errors have been addressed and new terms accepted into use, the vendor will submit facility data to each COR for acceptance of instrument marking data.
Any and all errors will be returned to vendor for correction. Vendor will resubmit the facility data with the corrections addressed. The COR will be presented with error-free data for consideration of Task Order acceptance. 
CORs will use the VA data quality tool to validate vendor-submitted data is in full compliance with DS020.
VA COR will provide written concurrence to formally accept the facility instrument marking data within 5 business days. 

The COR will begin considerations of the SPS Marking activities to be nearing completion/goal(s) when facilities are unable to provide any additional items to be marked and/or commissioned. These discussions will occur after facilities have determined available instrument sets have been marked and commissioned along with the majority of loose instrument (e.g. backup) inventory.  
Considering the exact number of medical/surgical and dental instruments to be marked and commissioned at each site is currently unknown, the following metric has been agreed upon by VA to trigger dialogue surrounding activities related to contractual completion of the marking and commissioning activities. The vendor routinely captures daily marking and commissioning activity which are reported to the COR or their designee. The  Number of Instruments Marked/Commissioned  is recorded daily during the lifespan of the project and routinely trended by the COR. When the  Number of Instruments Marked/Commissioned  metric s daily output falls below 70% of the trended average, the COR and Vendor will discuss determining an agreeable completion date.
The contractor during the course of their marking & commissioning activities, will build a standardized list for routine submission to the VA RTLS SPW WG for incorporation into this data collection and utilization. As part of the maintenance agreement, VA has purchased local subscriptions for Censitrac's long-term support and data maintenance. As new Catalog Numbers are added or received by the contractor from VA sites, routine updates and revisions to the field's Catalog Numbers will be provided to the VA RTLS SPW WG for review. Data submitted with missing or incorrect information will delay incorporation/completion. 

The following table provides the number of estimated instruments requiring marking and commissioning by facility and the date work should be completed:

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT to award Sole Source- Mahlbauer Inc<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) Office of Acquisition on behalf of its Office of Currency Manufacturing intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price commercial contract for emergency maintenance and repair for the Currency Over Printing Equipment (COPE) Vision Inspection System (VIS) on COPE Press 23 at Washington DC facilities. The intended contractor is Mahlbauer Inc., 226 Pickett Line, Newport News, VA 23603. The Government intends to award a sole source contract utilizing a Justification for Soliciting from a Single Source IAW FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b).<br />The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) has an urgent need to repair the Currency Over Printing Equipment (COPE) Vision Inspection System (VIS) on COPE 23. The Currency Over Printing Equipment (COPE) presses have been specifically designed for the BEP and they utilize the letter press printing process. The COPE Division is a production area in the Office of Currency Manufacturing responsible for the production of U.S. Currency. This section maintains high speed multi-functional printing presses that include overprinting of U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve Seals, as well as serial numbers. Presses are equipped with a COPE Vision Inspection System (CVIS) that provides for in-line inspection of currency notes. The system alerts the COPE pressmen to sheets whose COPE attributes are potentially not up to standardized specifications, checking them using grayscale technology for position of the COPE features and correctness of the serial numbers, prefixes, suffixes, and bank numbers. If a sheet is identified as being defective by the system, it is pulled in order to make a final determination as to whether or not it should continue through the process.<br />Currently the COPE 23 has been operating unreliably. Readings are sporadic and erroneous. The BEP Equipment Managers (EM) have exhausted in house resources to troubleshoot the issue but to no avail. An OEM technician is needed urgently to perform onsite diagnostics, repair and return the equipment to full operational state. Muhlbauer is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and currently has sole proprietorship of this inspection system and was responsible for the installation and training of the system to the BEP Electro Machinist (Maintenance) and Pressman (Operators).<br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive offers/quotes/proposals. A determination not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The solicitation will not be posted. To be considered, responses MUST be received NO LATER THAN 09:00AM, EASTERN STANDARD TIME, DECEMBER 4, 2017. Additionally, interested sources must be registered and currently active in the System for Award Management (SAM), found at https://www.sam.gov. Responses MUST be submitted within the closing date/time of publication of this notice. Point of Contact regarding this notice is Maureen Cameron, Contract Specialist at 202-874-4505 or maureen.cameron@bep.gov and C. E. Hoddinott, Contracting Officer at 202-874-0798 or Charles.hoddinott@bep.gov<br /><br />Contracting Office Address<br />14th &amp; C Streets SW<br />Washington, DC 20228

<DESC><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
<p>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</p>
<p><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY:</strong><br /><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR). TASAR features a cockpit automation system that monitors for potential flight trajectory improvements and displays them to the pilot. These wind-optimized flight trajectory changes are pre-cleared of potential conflicts with other known airplane traffic, weather hazards, and airspace restrictions. The objective of TASAR is to improve the process in which pilots request flight path and altitude modifications due to changing flight conditions. Changes may be made to reduce flight time, increase fuel efficiency, or improve some other flight attribute desired by the operator. The TASAR technology provides pilots with recommended flight path and altitude improvements that are more likely to be approved by ATC. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent 8,977,482.</p>
<p>To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LARC-DL-technologygateway@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information. Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company. Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well. For more information about licensing other NASA Langley-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Langley's Technology Gateway at https://technologygateway.nasa.gov/</p>
<p>These responses are provided to members of NASA Langley's Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development "OSACB" for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register. <strong>No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.</strong></p>

<DESC><strong>Synopsis:</strong>
<p>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY:</strong></p>
<p>Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a system to increase the effective piezoelectric constant and the mechanical energy input to energy harvesting transducers. This results in practical performance advantages including higher mechanical-electrical coupling and conversion efficiencies, and more efficient operation across a range of vibrational frequencies.<br /><br />Energy management is one of the most challenging issues in the world today. Accordingly, various energy harvesting technologies have gained attention, including harvesting energy from ambient vibration sources using piezoelectric materials. However, conventional piezoelectric energy harvesting transducer (PEHT) structures have effective piezoelectric constants that are lower than about 10^4 pC/N, (resonant mode). These low piezoelectric constants lead to conventional PEHTs not being able to harvest electric power effectively. Further, for a specific vibration/motion source, it would be advantageous to maximize the mechanical energy captured from the vibration structure into the piezoelectric device and to convert a greater fraction of that mechanical energy into electrical energy more efficiently.</p>
<p>This invention is a system and method using multistage force amplification of piezoelectric energy harvesting transducers (MFAPEHTs) to increase the effective piezoelectric constant to &gt;10^6 pC/N and to increase the mechanical energy input to the device. The invention utilizes 33 mode PZT to permit maximum coupling between the input mechanical energy with the piezoelectric material, and multilayer construction of single crystal PMN-PT material to significantly amplify the voltage/charge generation and storage from the applied mechanical force. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent 9,048,759.</p>

The justification for restricting competition is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. AT&amp;T has been used over the last few years and changing companies would require changing hardware.&nbsp; Users would lose their contacts and any other information saved to the devices.&nbsp; Making a change like this would require significant coordination with the wing commander and all other commanders and would result in a lapse of service.&nbsp; Given the ops tempo of the wing, a lapse is unacceptable at this time.&nbsp;
<p>This is not a formal solicitation, nor is this synopsis considered a request for proposals or quotations. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source or offerors are more advantageous to the Government.

<p>This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. NAICS: 523910.</p>
<p>The New Orleans District, US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) - Only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The New Orleans District intends to purchase 13 saline marsh mitigation credits from the State of Louisiana In Lieu Fee (ILF) Mitigation Program in the Detaic Plain. The mitigation credits will fully satisfy the Corp's mitigation requirements for impacts to 3.65 Average Annual Habitat Units (AAHUs) of saline marsh associated with the filling of 8.38 acres of saline marsh. These impacts occurred during work associated with the construction of Grand Isle and Vicinity Beach Erosion and Hurricane Protection Project (supplemental Environmental Decision Document #56, March 2009).  There are currently no mitigation banks in the 8 digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC #08070300) area that offer mitigation credits for saline marsh.</p>
<p>For a mitigation bank to be considered responsive and responsible, the mitigation bank shall:</p>
<p>-be approved by CEMVN and in full compliance with its Mitigation Banking Instrument (MBI), its other legal instruments (such as its conservation servitude and its financial assurances) and the standards set forth in 33 CFR Part 332;<br />-provide the habitat type that matches the habitat type being mitigated;<br />-have mitigation credits assessed using version 1.0 of the Wetland Value Assessment (WVA) Community Model available to fully compensate for the impacts to the particular habitat to be mitigated; and have a duly-recorded perpetual conservation servitude/easement.</p>
<p>Parties must be registered in SAM (sam.gov) and may express their interest, accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than December 8, 2017 by 11:00am Central Standard Time. Responses should be sent to michelle.y.lappen@usace.army.mil. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement; therefore, the initial submission must include adequate information for the Contracting Officer to determine whether the contractor is capable of providing the required services. Additional information will not be requested. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Rock Island District, intends to enter into a firm fixed price contract with Flow-Technics, Inc. The NAICS code for this procurement is 811310 with a size standard not to exceed $7.5M.</p>

<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES and no solicitation will be issued; however, any SAM registered firm that believes it can meet the requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement listed.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Questions should be directed to Beth Williams at 309-794-5333; email: elizabeth.a.williams@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>Pump #2 at the Rice Lake pump station is currently inoperable following reinstallation and startup testing in July 2017.  The Contractor shall provide an operable pump to include the following work: The disconnection and removal of the pump at the project location and transportation of the pump to the repair facility.  The disassembly and evaluation of one 48" diameter submersible pump to include inspection report.  The repair, reassembly and testing of the pump at the repair facility.  The transportation of the pump to the project location.  The reinstallation and reconnection of the pump as well as erecting engineer/startup services at the project location.  The Contractor shall provide an erecting engineer authorized by the manufacturer for the startup of the pump at the project location.</p>
<p>Pump #2 is a submersible axial flow Sulzer/ABS VUP 1001-M2200/12 propeller pump with a 295 HP submersible electric motor, 460V, 3 phase, 60HZ.  Pump power cable maximum O.D. is 2.37 inches and pump control cable maximum O.D. is 0.77 inches.  Pump cable diameter information is based on the technical data provided for the pump during the original construction of the pump station.</p>
<p>The pump was rendered inoperable while under the product warranty period of 90 days with the manufacturer (Sulzer).  The pump must be repaired by a certified Sulzer service/repair center in order for warranty coverage to be maintained and/or extended.  It would not be reasonable for the Government to utilize a non-authorized service/repair center and not in the best interest of the non-Federal Sponsor.  Any actions taken by the Government to jeopardize the original and/or extended warranty is unacceptable to the ILDNR.  Therefore, the repairs to the pump are to be made by the original pump supplier/manufacturer. The proposed Contractor is the original pump supplier/manufacturer. This direct procurement to the original pump supplier/manufacturer is critical to restore pumping capability and to provide a functioning pump station to the ILDNR.  Failure to provide a completely operational pump station before the migratory season in Fall 2018 may result in additional costs to the ILDNR for temporary pumping.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">The Department of Defense (DoD) Defense Enterprise Science Initiative (DESI) is a pilot program that supports use-inspired basic research performed by university-industry teams.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DESI is sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD/R&amp;E), and is run in collaboration with the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), and the Army Research Office (ARO).</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">DESI incentivizes use-inspired basic research projects, defined as a scientific study or experiment directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in the context of end-use applications. Projects funded in the program bring together industry and university teams with the aim of discovering completely new solutions to challenging defense and national security problems, and using that knowledge to influence existing or new acquisition programs. DESI-funded projects also aim to accelerate the impact of basic research results on defense capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">Industry's initial role in a DESI project is to provide a national security context for the defense challenge, and to collaborate with the university research team throughout the project. The university's role is to invent or discover knowledge that could be leveraged for completely new solutions to the defense challenge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a follow-on to research conducted with DESI funding, the industry partner is expected to further develop the project's results into new capabilities that may be offered to DoD for future acquisition considerations.</p>

(b) In the event that the automated system at https://atlevel1.dtic.mil/at/ is not available (e.g., server problems), Level I AT Awareness Training can be provided by a qualified instructor. However, if the training is not completed online, the Level I AT Awareness Instructor qualification must be coordinated with the Installation Antiterrorism Officer (or Installation Security equivalent) and the resultant name(s) of approved instructors shall be provided the contracting officer or designee along with all associated cost or schedule impacts to the contract. (c) Antiterrorism performance (Level I AT Awareness Training attendance and compliance) may be documented as a performance metric under the resultant contract, and be part of past performance information in support of future source selections. (End of clause)<BR><BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you
first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting
officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel
Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage
interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the
Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract
award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and
within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest
decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To
be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR
33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest
Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent
to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the
contracting officer for resolution.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-96).</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990, with a small business size standard of $15.0</p>
<p>The Clinical Center/Radiology &amp; Imaging Sciences has a requirement to develop and validate a cost effective, easy-to-use and fully integrated navigation system for needle placement during image guided cancer diagnosis and treatment. Applications include but are not limited to biopsy, various thermal ablations (e.g. radiofrequency, cryo-, microwave, and laser ablation), and brachytherapy.</p>
<p>Accurate diagnostic and/or therapeutic intervention depends on accurate needle insertion, which may be extremely difficult in certain settings. In standard CT-guided needle placement procedures, translation from a pre-planned needle angle to the actual intra-procedural needle insertion is estimated only with the physician's visuospatial abilities and experience.</p>
<p>The goal of this contract is to improve needle placement in clinical practice. Image-guided needle insertion is a promising method for fulfilling the project goal, but the system must be cost-effective, accurate, and ergonomic to be clinically feasible. The proposed system's hardware includes a compact guidance platform that tracks needle-based interventional instruments, and provides navigation information to the clinician during the procedure. The system will be designed to assist with cancer treatment planning and procedure execution.</p>
<p>The technology will be a compact tracker design that can clip onto needles and provide Micro Electro Mechanical (MEM) inertial-based tracking. The hardware will also have fewer sterility requirements and it will be easier to calibrate compared to existing electromagnetic and optical tracking systems. The calibration step of the device only takes a few seconds, making it practically negligible. The wireless clip design allows the navigation device to be easily attached to and removed from any standard needles, which gives the physician the highly desired freedom to benefit from the navigation while minimizing its impact on the clinical workflow. Our device allows for visual guidance during procedures by providing real-time angulation tracking of needles, catheters, or interventional tools. Visual guidance will improve targeting accuracy, and reduce procedure time and side effects.</p>
<p>Outcome: The product of this contract is a fully integrated needle-guidance system prototype that is ready for human clinical trials. The system will be prototyped and evaluated in a live animal/human study to quantify the targeting accuracy and workflow for CT, Cone Beam CT, and Ultrasound-guided procedures.</p>
<p>Specifications:<br />A2. Engineering Specifications:</p>
<p>A2. Engineering Specifications:</p>
<p>1. Wireless needle tracker</p>
<p>The Government seeks prototypes of wireless needle trackers to address the challenges in needle placement procedures by accurately tracking the needle angular and positional information. The needle tracker design should be compact, wireless, and can be clipped onto any needle instrument (Fig. 1a-d). The system will provide 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) sensing at up to 40 Hz. The tracker should be configured to wirelessly stream data via Bluetooth. The system should be ready for calibration and validation.</p>
<p>Sensor Fusion<br />The Government requires a method to combine the use of a gyroscopic sensing and the gravity vector to enhance needle tracking accuracy.</p>
<p>A3. Specific Instrument Descriptions and Deliverables: The contract deliverables include the wireless tracker electronics, mechanical protection cases, calibration docking stations, tracker chargers, and software source code for streaming out the positional information from the tracker.</p>
<p>&bull; 3 prototype Micro Electro Mechanical (MEM) trackers for abdominal biopsy needles<br />&bull; 3 prototype MEM trackers for abdominal ablation catheters<br />&bull; 3 prototype MEM trackers for abdominal ultrasound probes<br />&bull; 3 prototype universal MEM tracking beacons for multiple-propose tracking <br />&bull; 3 prototype MEM trackers for Prototype MRI-guided prostate transperineal focal laser ablation <br />&bull; 3 needle holders integrated with MEM trackers and an MRI visible needle-guide for navigation and registration<br />&bull; 3 prototype 100mmX100mm MRI visible grid fiducial markers for prostate transperineal procedures<br />&bull; 3 prototype electromagnetic tracker needle clips for multiple-propose needle procedures<br />&bull; The tracker cases together with the tracker calibration docking station will be fabricated using 3D printing technology and are made deposable.</p>

<p>(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.</p>
<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-</p>
<p>(1) &#9633; In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) &#9633; Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 811310 with a size standard of $7.5M. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>The requirement is for a 12-month base period and two additional option periods pursuant to FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Environmental Satellite data and Information Service, Field Delegate requires the following:<br />PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to establish a Service Support Agreement (SSA) for maintenance and support for the Uninterruptable Power Source (UPS) systems at the NOAA/NESDIS Fairbanks Command and Data Acquisition Station (FCDAS) in Fairbanks, Alaska, and at the FCDAS remote antenna site in Barrow, Alaska.</p>
<p>SCOPE OR MISSION:<br />FCDAS requires preventive maintenance and technical support for emergency power systems and components, including batteries, on-site emergency service, travel to and from the sites, labor, replacement parts, tech support, call management, field modifications, emergency telephone support 7 days/week, 24 hours/day. FCDAS provides essential satellite ground system services for earth observation spacecraft in support of property, life, and economic activities of the United States. Electrical power is mission-critical, and the UPS systems provide conditioned electrical power to all ground system equipment, including temporary power continuity in the event of a commercial power outage. Regular preventive maintenance and technical support on the UPS systems is required to maintain 99.9999% availability of critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />FCDAS is a 24/7 satellite tracking station operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in support of national and international operational and research environmental monitoring spacecraft located near Fox, Alaska, approximately 15 miles northeast of Fairbanks. FCDAS also operates an unmanned satellite tracking system at the NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratory in Barrow, Alaska. Barrow is a remote community on the North Slope where travel and working conditions are often difficult. The FCDAS UPS systems consist of two MGE Uninterruptable Power Source (UPS) Model E6TUPS500 UPS systems, S/N 208488.01 and 208488.06, which are critical elements of the electrical power infrastructure on site. The systems condition power and provide temporary backup power to the entire site. In the event of commercial power failure, the UPS systems hold station power for up to 30 minutes or until station generators automatically engage. The Barrow UPS consists of one APC UPS Model SUVTP15KF4B4S, 15kVA 208V 3PH UPS with battery modules and one SBPSU10K15F-WP External Maintenance bypass panel. The Barrow site does not have emergency generators, and the UPS is intended to feed conditioned power to the antenna equipment for brief commercial outages.</p>
<p>TASKS/REQUIREMENTS:<br />The Contractor shall perform preventive maintenance (PM), adjustments, and repairs to all UPS batteries, components, and subsystems to ensure the UPS' are able to perform to factory specification. Work includes periodic site visits for PMs, on-site emergency service, travel to and from the sites, labor, replacement parts, technical support, field modifications, emergency telephone support 7 days/week, 24 hours/day.

<ARCHDATE>01112018
<CONTACT>Katherine Koleski, Phone 202-624-1482, Fax 202-624-1406, Email kkoleski@uscc.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS:<br />November 29, 2017<br /><br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />January 10, 2018
<p><br />ABOUT PROPOSALS. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on the U.S. role in China's biotechnology development.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION. The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov.</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in P.L. 113-291, Section 1259B), which states, "The Commission ... shall investigate and report ... on..."</p>
<p>"(B) The qualitative and quantitative nature of the transfer of United States production activities to the People's Republic of China, including the relocation of manufacturing, advanced technology and intellectual property, and research and development facilities, the impact of such transfers on the national security of the United States (including the dependence of the national security industrial base of the United States on imports from China), the economic security of the United States, and employment in the United States, and the adequacy of United States export control laws in relation to the People's Republic of China."</p>
<p>"(D) Foreign investment by the United States in the People's Republic of China and by the People's Republic of China in the United States, including an assessment of its economic and security implications...."</p>
<p>"(H) The drivers, nature, and implications of the growing economic, technological, political, cultural, people-to-people, and security relations of the People's Republic of China's with other countries, regions, and international and regional entities (including multilateral organizations)...."</p>
<p>This report's key research requirements are:</p>
<p>1. Assess the current state of China's biotechnology sector. Provide an overview of the size, nature, scope, and international competitiveness of China's biotechnology sector. Identify the major governmental policies and programs seeking to enhance the performance and capabilities of its domestic biotechnology sector. Identify the major private sector players in terms of research, commercial activities, and funding in China, and summarize their activities and funding. Compare and contrast the capabilities of China vs. the United States and other major Western countries with significant biotechnology sectors.</p>
<p>2. Assess the role of foreign firms and technologies in China's biotechnology development. What are the means by which China acquires foreign technology or know-how? Identify which U.S. and other foreign biotechnologies China has already acquired or is likely to target for acquisition through legal or other means including traditional and cyber-enabled espionage. How, if at all, do these acquisitions and technology transfers align with China's biotechnology objectives as laid out in the Made in China 2025, 13th Five-Year Bioindustry Development Plan, and other biotechnology-related plans? Assess the effectiveness of tools (such as export controls) and resources available to U.S. law enforcement or other relevant agencies to protect sensitive and dual-use biotechnologies.</p>
<p>3. Identify and assess Chinese investment in the U.S. biotechnology industry, including through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), joint ventures (JVs), venture capital investments, and other types of investment. What is the volume of Chinese investment in the U.S. biotechnology industry? How much financing has the Chinese government provided to support these investments? What are the investment patterns of Chinese state-owned or state-invested enterprises, state-sponsored or state-controlled research institutes, national champions, and private firms in biotechnology? What are the trends in the types of biotech capabilities and companies acquired or targeted by Chinese entities over the last five years, and what changes are anticipated in the next five years? What are the patterns in the types of investment (M&amp;As, JVs, etc.) used to acquire technologies? How, if at all, are these investments contributing to the development of China's biotechnology industry? Do acquired firms such as Syngenta still face market barriers to their products (e.g., genetically modified organisms) in China as they faced before acquisition?</p>
<p>4. Assess China's access to U.S. healthcare-related data. What is the importance of healthcare-related data to future biotechnology developments? What activities and investments has China made to build the infrastructure and talent base to support the development of a national data clearinghouse and the requisite tools (e.g., machine learning tools, algorithms)? How are Chinese firms expanding their access to healthcare-related data domestically and internationally? How many, and which, Chinese firms have received U.S. accreditation to carry out genetic sequencing and other diagnostic testing for U.S. citizens? To what extent have U.S. citizens, firms, or research institutes shared healthcare-related data with Chinese firms? Is this access reciprocal for U.S. researchers and firms? What advantages does this access to data provide to Chinese and U.S. firms? What are the U.S. and Chinese legal protections for the U.S. healthcare-related data handled by Chinese firms? Assess the effectiveness of these protections for preventing misuse and ensuring privacy. Does the United States have adequate data protections and, if not, what proposals have been made to enhance security?</p>
<p>5. Assess the establishment of U.S.-based research institutes by Chinese biotechnology firms. What motivates Chinese firms to establish research institutes in the United States? What is the nature of their research and development activities? How, if at all, are these institutes contributing to the development of China's biotechnology industry? What are the opportunities and risks of these research institutes to U.S. economic and national security interests?</p>
<p>6. Assess China's partnerships with U.S. biotechnology firms, universities, research institutes, and non-profits. What relationships, if any, have Chinese firms, research institutes, or universities developed in the United States related to biotechnology? What are the trends in the types of biotech capabilities pursued and how, if at all, do these trends align with China's biotechnology objectives and goals? How have U.S. partners structured these relationships to address risks from China such as fabricated research and clinical data or intellectual property theft? How successful have those efforts been in addressing risks? How, if at all, have these partnerships benefited U.S. researchers or advancements in the field? How, if at all, are these partnerships contributing to the development of China's biotechnology industry? What oversight authority exists within the U.S. government to monitor, assess, and approve of these types of partnerships? What role, if any, should the U.S. government play in these partnerships to maximize the potential benefits while minimizing the potential risks?</p>
<p>The report should include an executive summary of the report's key findings; a brief overview of the sources and analytic methodology used for the report; and a brief explanation of the scope and limitations of the report.</p>

<p>2. Once the Commission selects a contractor for this project, and a contract is signed, public notice of this may be made on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>3. The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion. In ordinary circumstances, once the Commission selects a contractor and a contract is signed, a draft report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 90 days from the date the contract is signed. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments. The Commission recognizes, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract. The contractor, in their contract proposal, should stipulate the time frame for submission of the draft report. It is to be understood; however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.</p>
<p>4. As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Director shall act as the Commission's representative in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in this Request for Proposals (RFP). The Research Director shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.</p>
<p>5. The report shall be free of typographical errors and conform to the Chicago Manual of Style. Upon receipt of all drafts, the Commission will inspect the document for typographical errors and deviations from the Chicago Manual of Style guidelines. At the discretion of the Commission, if a draft contains excessive deficiencies, the Commission will return the draft to the contractor and request the contractor cure the draft of deficiencies within five (5) working days (not counting weekends and Federal holidays). Upon resubmission of the draft by the contractor to the Commission, should deficiencies remain, the Commission, at its discretion, will submit the draft to its copyeditor for correction, the cost of which ($45.34 per hour) will be deducted from the final cost of the contract. The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.</p>
<p>6. At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this RFP may be posted on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>7. Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant they will perform this work solely for the Commission, and the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.</p>
<p>8. The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there will not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.</p>
<p>9. After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's website and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.</p>
<p>10. At the discretion and request of the Commission, the contractor shall, within a year after publication of the report, agree to participate in up for two (2) separate briefings, and up to one (1) public hearing, held by the Commission, of up to two (2) hours each in the Washington, DC area, supported by at least one (1) individual affiliated with the contractor identified as "key personnel." This could include, but not necessarily be limited to, briefing the content of the research to Commissioners and Commission staff, appearing as witnesses at a public hearing held by the Commission, and briefing the content of the research to Members of Congress and/or their staff. No additional remuneration will be provided to the contractor for these briefings or a hearing. The Commission will make a good faith effort to schedule briefings and a hearing at times that are subject to mutual agreement.</p>

<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>

Synopsis: 
COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Brand Name or Equal commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
Solicitation number 36C10G-18-Q-0005 is issued for this combined synopsis/solicitation; this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-94 and 2005-95, both dated 19 Jan 2017.

Requirement Description:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is transforming the service it provides to Veterans through the MyVA effort.  MyVA was established in July 2015 to modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs  culture, processes, and capabilities to put the needs, expectations and interests of Veterans and their families first.  This effort is highly visible, with significant attention within the highest levels of government, the public, and the press. 
As this transformation progresses, VA's mission requirements to support America s Veterans are growing more quickly than its budget.  Key elements of VA s expanded mission requirements include:
15% expansion in the number of Veterans enrolled in VA Healthcare from FY 2009 through FY 2016
More than 100% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016  in the number of 100% disabled Veterans cared for by VA
6% increase in the number of medical appointments scheduled in FY 2016 vs FY 2014
More than 300% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016 in the number of Veterans receiving education benefits through the VA
In order to ensure we are able to continue to provide Veterans with the benefits and care they have earned through their selfless service, VA is changing the way we do business.  Specifically, we are improving the management of our supply chain to aggregate demand and facilitate ease of ordering in the field.  Throughout VA, we are moving from local contracting to national contracting whenever feasible.  Simplified ordering processes will drive volume towards suppliers with national contracts.  Simultaneously, greater cost transparency throughout the VA will allow clinicians and VA leaders to select medical equipment that optimizes Veteran outcomes at the lowest cost.
For our suppliers, we anticipate that these changes will ease the process of doing business with the VA and drive down our suppliers  costs.  We welcome opportunities to work closely with suppliers to further reduce costs.  In return, we expect that suppliers will offer the VA value commensurate with VA s status as the largest integrated healthcare provider in the United States.  Specifically, VA expects that it will receive the most favorable prices, warranties, conditions, benefits, and terms for the same product as those given by the supplier to any provider in the country.  We expect that VA s large volumes will increasingly be directed toward those suppliers best able to offer value to the VA.  VA looks forward to collaborating with its suppliers to further drive down costs in order to deliver optimal value to our Veterans.
In light of this transformation, the VA has a requirement to purchase Dermatomes to deliver patient care at its VA Medical Centers throughout the United States, U.S. Territories, Guam and the Philippines. A Dermatome is a surgical instrument used to produce thin slices of skin from a donor area, in order to use them for making skin grafts. One of its main applications is for reconstituting skin areas damaged by grade 3 burns or trauma.
A single award Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract will be awarded for the purchase of Brand Name or Equal equipment in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications and schedule of this solicitation herein.  Quotes shall contain the terms for cost/price and technical capabilities of the Brand Name or Equal equipment.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112   Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing and the associated size standard are 1000 employees.  This procurement action is for full and open competition.  
This acquisition is for a single-award Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.5 for Dermatomes as identified in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule.  All interested companies shall provide a quote for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) listed in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule.  
The ordering period is one year with two 12 month option years.  Delivery is FOB destination.  Firm-Fixed Price Orders will be placed against this contract in writing and will provide the delivery locations, delivery dates and exact quantities. 
The FAR provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition including attached addenda to the provision.
The FAR provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, and the specific evaluation criteria as attached addenda also applies to this acquisition.  
The offeror is to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer.
Clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding any addenda to the clause.
Clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding which, if any, of the additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to the acquisition.

<DESC>A Second Amendment is being added due to additional vendor questions.
<p>1. Do you want a structure that provides interior finished dimensions of 8'x20'? If so, what is your requirement for footprint or outside length, width and height?</p>
<p>2. What would you prefer for your interior finished walls?</p>
<p>3. Do we need to address lighting or just use basic practice?</p>
<p>Answers:</p>
<p>1. Interior finished dimensions do not need to be exactly 8'X20' however they should not be any smaller than 7'X18'</p>
<p>2. interior finished walls should be finished in accordance with general guidelines/ best practices for offices and labs. Alternatively materials that are used for finishing mobile home trailers may be used. The materials used should not prevent an employee from working temporarily in the mobile lab to take measurements.</p>
<p>3. The mobile lab should come with lighting. Overhead lights are preferred and enough of them should be used to illuminate the entire interior working area to office like or lab like conditions. Exterior lighting is not needed.</p>

Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) the schedule of supplies/services; (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause; (3) the clause at 52.212-5; (4) addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5) solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) other paragraphs of this clause; (7) the Standard Form 1449; (8) other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) the specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>This is a Brand Name Only Requirement: In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's name and part numbers. If your
response does not contain all of the required information called out in this
notice, your quote will be determined nonresponsive and will not be
considered for award.<BR><BR>The apparent  awardee shall acknowledge acceptance of any and all re-postings (amendments), in writing, prior to any award resulting from this solicitation.<BR><BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use
commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA

available, contact the HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures.<BR><BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation- Commercial Items;  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>

Chapter VI: Other Than Full and Open Competition (OFOC) SOP
Attachment 4:  Single Source Justification for SAP under $150K
JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b) (3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.

2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

The Veterans Health Administration, Syracuse VAMC requires an Aquarius Urodynamic System to use for bladder function testing in evaluating bladder pressures, capacity, emptying, and flow. Determines necessity for further testing, operative procedures, and appropriate follow up. Approximately 9-11 urodynamic tests are performed weekly at this VA facility.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

The Aquarius urodynamic system is the only know system of its kind to have live annotation editing and compatibility with the current EMR system), so necessary changes can be done during the study, improving accuracy, avoiding having to go back after the study is completed to change event reporting, as would have to be done with the other brands.  Aquarius Urodynamic system also has HIPAA compliant software and exclusively provides reverse compatible software format allowing for retrospective viewing of all saved patient files. It also exclusively offers one package including wireless catheters, wireless EMG, wireless uroflow. Reports would go directly into CPRS, eliminating the delay caused by printing the studies, then sending them for scanning, which sometimes takes weeks. They would be available immediately in CPRS. Data is archived, encrypted, can be transferred from current equipment to new. 

4. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

Aquarius system was compared to Morpheus (similar product) as part of Market Research which was determined to not meet the requesters need due to non-compatibility with EMR system.  Searched of FBO and comparable products/sources was completed and sole source nature of this requirement has been found to be valid.  
5. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.

<p>Request for Information. This a Request for Information Only (RFI).</p>
<p>Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) in support of the Program Executive Office Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S) Project Manager Distributed Common Ground System-Army (PM DCGS-A), is conducting market research to identify commercial items to satisfy current DCGS-A requirements pertaining to United States (U.S.) Army's Fixed Site facilities. The Government invites all business and academic organizations to respond to this RFI notice.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Government may elect not to proceed with a procurement after the results of the RFI. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>AN/FSQ-209(V)1, commonly referred to as the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Intelligence Processing Center Version 1 (IPC-v1), is a state-of-the-art battlefield intelligence system that hosts DCGS-A software at US Army Fixed Site facilities. It provides fully integrated and timely intelligence on the battlefield. The DCGS-A IPC-v1 is the core framework for a worldwide distributed, network centric, system-of-systems architecture that conducts collaborative intelligence operations and production. The system is housed in the DCGS-A Fixed Site facilities and consists of privately hosted servers and storage arrays.</p>
<p>This RFI is specifically focused on identifying commercial items to upgrade/replace the DCGS-A IPC-v1 enterprise data warehouse component, also known as the "Brain." Specifically, the Government is seeking capabilities that can dynamically ingest data from multiple sources, index and store that data, provide common/open interfaces to securely access that data, and to enable data discovery.</p>
<p>TRADOC Capability Manager - Foundation (TCM-F) has developed, in conjunction with the Intelligence Center of Excellence (ICoE), a draft Capability Drop requirements document outlining the operationally relevant requirements for DCGS-A's enterprise data warehouse.</p>
<p>To update the DCGS-A system of systems effectively through a series of Capability Drops, PM DCGS-A has provided a draft DCGS-A Reference Architecture (RA) that is based on Modular Open Systems Architecture (MOSA) principles and aligned to the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) Reference Architecture Services View - 4 (SvcV-4). The components of the RA that are relevant to this RFI are the Data Ingress, Data Processing, Data Persistence, and Data Egress modules and their associated interfaces. It must also be able to support Data Analytics in future releases by providing well-defined, industry standards-based, software interfaces. In support of the Reference Architecture, a Conceptual Data Model (CDM) has been provided which identifies, at a high-level of abstraction, the relevant entity classes that are managed or involved in the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) activities within the scope of DCGS-A and the principal relationships between those entity classes. Additionally, the enterprise data warehouse solution needs to be flexible enough to adapt to changes in the architecture and data model, as well as the addition of new, and modification of existing, data sources.</p>
<p>3.0 White Paper and Supporting Documentation</p>
<p>Any interested business or academic organization should provide a white paper that addresses each section below no later than 17 NOV 2017. The supporting documents for this RFI are marked as For Official Use Only (FOUO). To obtain a copy of these supporting documents (Draft Capability Drop document, Reference Architecture, Conceptual Data Model, Enterprise Data Warehouse Capabilities Crosswalk, Government Standards) send an email with your organization name, address, and CAGE and SMO codes to Shaun Cronen, shaun.m.cronen.civ@mail.mil and Christopher Laird, christopher.m.laird2.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>The white paper must address, at a minimum, the following information requests listed below:</p>
<p>Section 1: Draft Capability Drop Document</p>
<p>Fully Describe your solution's ability to meet each requirement within the draft Capability Drop document, as well as providing any comments about the requirements as currently written. To enhance understanding of the requirements within the draft Capability Drop document, a draft capabilities crosswalk spreadsheet has been provided that expands on the requirements as written.</p>
<p>Section 2: Summary of Approach</p>
<p>(A) Provide a summary of your approach to meet the capabilities outlined in the draft Capability Drop document. In a diagram format, similar to the draft DCGS-A Reference Architecture (RA) Data Layer Implementation in the DCGS-A Technical Reference Model (TRM) (Figure 5) and as described in Section 3.2.2. Identify your technology component(s) that will meet the capabilities for Data Ingress, Data Processing, Data Persistence, and Data Egress. Also describe how your solution is scalable, extensible, and able to support the integration third-party tools, such as Data Analytics and Authentication and Authorization solutions. Provide supporting technical description for each identified technology component and the applicable standards leveraged.</p>
<p>(B) If your solution can provide more than the Data Ingress, Data Processing, Data Persistence, and Data Egress modules outlined on Figure 5 and Section 3.2.2 of the draft Reference Architecture, provide a diagram and full description of your solution for these additional capabilities. These may include, but are not limited to: data synchronization &amp; replication, data analytics (e.g., automated entity and relationship extraction, data fusion), operating in a disconnected, intermittent, and/or limited (DIL) environment, automated system and data source integration, interoperability, etc. If these additional capabilities incur additional costs over the base capability, enumerate those separately in Section 10: Costs.</p>
<p>Section 3: Modular Open Systems Architecture (MOSA)</p>
<p>Explain how your proposed solution supports a modular open systems architecture approach. Provide a list of standards and defined system interfaces anticipated to support the draft Reference Architecture.</p>
<p><br />Section 4: Reference Architecture (RA)</p>
<p>(A) DCGS-A has provided a draft Reference Architecture. Provide any suggestions, critiques, or methods on how this could be improved, limited to the scope of this RFI (Data Ingress, Data Processing, Data Persistence, Data Analytics [if relevant], and Data Egress).</p>
<p>(B) (Optional) Provide any additional suggestions, critiques, or methods on how the other sections of the DCGS-A Reference Architecture could be improved.</p>
<p>Section 5: Data Source Adaptation</p>
<p>DCGS-A's fixed sites ingest hundreds of different data sources, with new sources being added each year. Describe how your solution adapts when new data sources and new data types (structured, unstructured, and/or binary) are introduced, including the process for adding a new data source and exposing that data to other tools in the system (e.g. indexing, query). Also explain how your solution is flexible and scalable to accommodate data ranges from terabytes up to ten petabytes.</p>
<p>Section 6: Security</p>
<p>(A) Provide applicable documentation identifying methods, procedures, and/or processes that meet DoD certification requirements, per security domain (NIPR, SIPR, JWICS, NSANet, as well as any relevant coalition networks), in accordance with the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). In addition, identify any current certifications or accreditations that your system may have.</p>
<p>(B) Many of the data sources that the DCGS-A ingests only exist on classified networks and will require classified data adapters. If asked to integrate these classified data sources, describe how you will provide cleared facilities and personnel to support this task.</p>
<p>Section 7: Commercial Items</p>
<p>Describe how your solution meets the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) definition of a Commercial Item. Identify the scope of "minor modifications" or "custom configurations" required to fully meet the requirements identified within this RFI.</p>
<p>Section 8: Cloud Hosting</p>
<p>Explain your approach to support and/or migrate between (1) privately-hosted, (2) commercially-hosted, or (3) hybrid cloud computing models. In addition, provide any information relevant to the Intelligence Community - Information Technology Enterprise (IC-ITE) Commercial Cloud Services (C2S), and AWS GovCloud, if applicable.</p>
<p>Section 9: Costs</p>
<p>Using the attached CD2 Software Pricing Template provide the following:</p>
<p>(A) Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of applicable costs for the proposed solution as described in this RFI. The ROM should include licensing costs (e.g., unlimited enterprise, term (with durations and price ranges), perpetual), follow-on maintenance support (to include new data source integration, or costed separately on a per-item basis), training costs and the option for persistent, on-site engineering support. The ROM should also include an enumerated cost for hosting within a public cloud environment (as per Section 9) to include estimated storage and processing requirements. Use the attached Software Pricing Template for quantity ranges.</p>
<p>(B) Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of applicable costs for the proposed solution as described in this RFI, with full Government Rights for a third party to maintain the system and provide new data source integration. The ROM should include licensing costs (e.g., unlimited enterprise, term (with durations and price ranges), perpetual), regular software license maintenance, and training costs. The ROM should also include an enumerated cost for hosting within a public cloud environment (as per Section 9) to include estimated storage and processing requirements. Use the attached Software Pricing Template for quantity ranges.</p>
<p>(C) The Army is required to perform an Analysis of Product Support Alternatives (APSA) to determine the most cost efficient method of providing long-term support and maintenance of software products. To support this analysis, in lieu of Licensing Costs, provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for the Government to procure the full source code and executables (including unlimited rights) of your solution.</p>
<p>This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry. This RFI is for planning purposes, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will follow.</p>
<p>The Government will use the information submitted in response to this notice at its discretion and will not provide comments to any submission; however, the Government reserves the right to contact any respondent to this notice for the sole purpose of enhancing understanding of the notice submission. All material provided will be treated as confidential. Company proprietary data will be reviewed by Government employees and authorized representatives only.<br />Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

This represents a significant upfront investment from BBG.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the expected build out time frame for any vendor other than Zayo of the dark fiber installations is 9-18 months and with provisioning windows that can take up to 90-120 days. TSI estimates the cost of a dark fiber build out to BBG headquarters would include a one-time cost of $180,000.00, or a three year term of $60,000.00 per year. TSI estimates the monthly recurring cost would be $7,500.00 ($2500 for the dark fiber and $5,000.00 for the amortizing for the dark fiber) for the first three years based on industry practice to amortize the build out cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Using service provider other than Zayo would require installation of a new dark fiber connection (estimated at $7,500.00) would be far greater than the cost of the current monthly connectivity cost of $2500.00.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>BBG is currently benefiting from Zayo&rsquo;s previous investment in connecting the Health and Human Services Agency, which shares office space with the Broadcasting Board </span></span></p>

11/07/2017: The purpose of this revision is to make publicly available the first iteration (V1) of the UASIPP Interested Parties List. The list has been added as an attachment.

11/02/2017: On October 25, 2017 the President directed the establishment of the Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Pilot Program (UASIPP) to test further integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) in a select number of State, local, and tribal jurisdictions (this includes U.S. Territories and holdings).

This new pilot program encourages State, local, and tribal governments, in partnership with UAS operators and other private sector stakeholders, to conduct advanced operations safely and with public support in affected communities.  The Department Of Transportation (DOT), through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), is announcing in a Federal Register Notice establishment of the UAS Integration Pilot Program, and identifies this site (https://faaco.faa.gov) to obtain the specific instructions for requesting access to a designated portal for submitting an application (in form of a proposal) to be considered for participation in the program. 

The first formal step for considering participants is the issuance of a Screening Information Request (SIR). The SIR, referred to in other Government agencies as a Request For Proposal, or RFP, is the vehicle through which the FAA will request prospective applicants to submit specific information for evaluation.  Applicants must be State, local or tribal Governments to be considered for award. Government applicants may team with industry.
The specific instructions for requesting access to the application portal are contained in the attached SIR. Applicants are required to provide their Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number with their request for portal access. This SIR (and any future changes) will be available on the FAA Contract Opportunities Web Site (https://faaco.faa.gov).  Additional information about the SIR process including the time critical schedule (SIR Table 1) should be reviewed immediately. The schedule within the SIR will be updated with hard dates when the Federal Register Notice (FRN) is formally published. The FRN publish date is expected to be on or about November 8, 2017.

The FAAs common acquisition process for obtaining information, evaluating, and selecting Applicants is contained in the agencys Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The FAA will use the AMS as guidance in the SIR process for obtaining and evaluating information.  The ultimate selection for the UASIPP Lead Participants will be at the discretion, and order, of the Secretary of Transportation.

Applicants who have been selected by the Secretary will enter, under Other Transaction Authority, into Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) with the FAA.  Each MOA will set out the terms and conditions under which the respective participant conducts the pilot program. A sample MOA is provided as an attachment.

The FAA anticipates awards of five or more MOAs resulting from this Screening Information Request (SIR). The period of performance is anticipated to be for three (3) years.
The Government will not provide any funding for project performance.
Each applicant must submit a proposal in accordance with the instructions contained in the attached SIR. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the SIR.
To be considered for award, applicants must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) and not listed on the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).  Prospective applicants are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this solicitation will be published at http://faaco.faa.gov under the current announcements for the FAA Headquarters.   It is the prospective applicants' responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement.  
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the SIR, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement. Therefore any cost associated with responding to this announcement is solely at the respondents expense.

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USDA is committed to supporting local food systems and expanding access for SNAP participants to healthy foods. Therefore, USDA has made it a priority to help more farmers' markets and direct-marketing farmers to become SNAP-authorized and actively participate in the SNAP program.</p>
<p>This FNS provides wireless EBT equipment to FMs and DMFs to markets currently participation, as well as markets yet to participate with the SNAP.</p>
<p>SCOPE/OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>Services include facilitating the distribution of wireless EBT equipment to eligible SNAP-authorized FMs and DMFs, providing FMs/DMFs with technical assistance in applying for this program, ordering, setting-up, and operating their EBT equipment, creating materials to publicize the availability of EBT equipment, and generating reports on EBT equipment distribution that meet the collection and reporting requirements of FNS.</p>

<p>As part of the application process, provide two (2) equipment options to qualified FMs and DMFs, and allow the applicant to choose. In each instance the option identified must be the lowest cost option that will provide full functionality. One equipment option will accept only SNAP. The second option will accept SNAP EBT, and commercial debit and credit. To the extent that cellular service needs may vary in different areas of the country, the contractor shall identify the best and most cost effective option for each area.</p>

The requirement is based on a survey previously conducted that identified an unstable parapet wall as a potential life safety hazard and source of water intrusion. The survey was performed under a previously awarded contract. The additional repairs discovered directly affect the ability to perform the work under the aforementioned contract which is currently under a suspension of work. The scope of work includes deconstructing the existing parapet wall around the high roof. While deconstructing the existing parapet, care should be taken to save as much of the existing brick as possible for use in the reconstruction of the parapet wall.
 The new parapet wall is to be a solid reinforced masonry wall with face brick on the exterior and reinforced CMU block on the interior side. Collar joint between the CMU and brick is to be grouted solid. Roof repairs including replacement of flashing plies where the roof meets the parapet wall will be required around the majority of the perimeter. Contractors must be able to complete the contract work within 180 days.

<DESC>The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for transcription services contract(s) to support DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The primary mission of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) is to adjudicate immigration cases by fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly interpreting and administering the Nation's immigration laws. Under delegated authority from the Attorney General, EOIR conducts immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews, and administrative hearings. Contractor personnel will furnish administrative, logistical, professional, and technical labor, supplies, equipment, facilities, and materials necessary to provide, in both hard copy and electronic format, typed transcripts of Government-owned recordings of immigration hearings on an as-ordered basis. The length of each immigration hearing ranges from one hour to an entire day or more. The hearings are primarily recorded on EOIR's digital audio recording system and, when necessary, on cassette tapes using analog recording equipment, and the tape becomes part of the official Record of Proceeding. The average length of a transcript resulting from one immigration hearing is approximately one hundred pages. The average hearing is 2.6 hours in length; some may be considerably longer. The major source of transcription services for EOIR is under the existing contracts, DJJ13-C-2424 with Deposition Services, DJJ13-C-2425 with Free State Reporting, and DJJ13-C-2426 with National Capitol Contracting. These indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts were awarded on April 1, 2013 and will expire on March 31, 2018. All three contracts are identical in scope. A single order is issued against each contract on an annual basis for anticipated services during the associated contract period.
<p><br />During the last fiscal year, the volume of transcript requests have increased by 21%. Over half of the Board of Immigration Appeals caseload consists of detained cases which require expeditious handling. Most of the transcription requests require a 5-day or 20-day turn-around time.

<DESC> AE Firm Questions with Government Provided Answers:

We are curious to know the VA s standards for qualified: 
(Question) Interior Designer (i.e., is it enough to be a registered architect with this experience, or are specific qualifications required?)    (Answer) B.S. or B.A. degree andat least 2 years of experience in Interior Design
(Question) Environmental (i.e., is it enough to be have certifications and training for hazardous materials, or are you looking for a specific type of engineer?)   (Answer) B.S. degree and at least 2 years of experience in Environmental Engineering 
(Question) Value Engineer (i.e., is it enough to be a registered architect or engineer with this experience, or are specific qualifications required?)   (Answer) Architect, Engineer, or Cost Estimator with at least 2 years of experience in value engineering 
(Question) Cost Engineer (i.e., is it enough to be a registered architect or engineer with this experience, or are specific qualifications required?)   (Answer) Architect, Engineer, or Cost Estimator with at least 2 years of experience in cost estimating 
(Question) Scheduler (i.e., is it enough to be a registered architect or engineer with this experience, or are specific qualifications required?)   (Answer) Architect, Engineer, or Project Manager with at least 2 years of experience in scheduling 
(Question) Risk Analyst (i.e., is it enough to be a registered architect or engineer with this experience, or are specific qualifications required?)   (Answer) Architect, Engineer, or Project Manager with at least 2 years of experience in Risk Analysis 
(Question) Historic Preservation(i.e., is it enough to be a registered architect or engineer with this experience, or are specific qualifications required?)   (Answer) The minimum professional qualifications in history are a graduate degree in history or closely related field; or a bachelor's degree in history or closely related field plus one of the following: At least two years of full-time experience in research, writing, teaching, interpretation, or other demonstrable professional activity with an academic institution, historic organization or agency, museum, or other professional institution; or substantial contribution through research and publication to the body of scholarly knowledge in the field of history. 
(Question) Security Specialist(i.e., is it enough to be a registered architect or engineer with this experience, or are specific qualifications required?)   (Answer) Must meet Security Specialist requirements as listed in VHA Physical Security Design Manual 
(Question) With regard to the position of  Environmental,  we presume this is meant for a specialist in identifying and designing abatement for hazardous materials (sometimes found in older structures). Are we correct in this assessment, or is there a different kind of  Environmental  position implied? (See also question 1.b.)   (Answer) Environmental Engineering may cover all RCRA, CERCLA, abatement, SWPP, and other facets of engineering in relation to healthy air, water, and land.
(Question) Under Selection Criterion 1, key personnel are identified as    individuals who   will provide unusual or unique expertise.  Could this be explained further? What qualifies as unusual or unique expertise relative to the generalized items listed under C. Project Information / Statement of Work and/or the items listed in Criterion 2?   (Answer) For example, if your firm has an experienced life safety engineer or health care planning architect, you may wish to highlight this expertise.
(Question) Also under Criterion 1, what is meant by the request for    a balanced licensed and/or certified workforce    in the disciplines listed? What qualifies as balanced?   (Answer) A team that presents a balance (variety) of disciplines appropriate for the types of work listed.
(Question) Under Criterion 2, PACT clinic planning is a term applied specifically to VA clinics. Our firm has experience with meeting similar design criteria in other, non-VA settings, but these are not PACT because these are not VA projects. How would you like us to address this?   (Answer) Please include any experience that your firm feels is similar.
(Question) Also under Criterion 2, regarding the 5 projects to be provided: 
(Question) We read this requirement to mean that only 5 projects are required for Section F; is this correct?   (Answer) You may provide up to (or a maximum) of 5 projects.
(Question) Our team has a number of projects for which we have completed our professional services; however, the project has not yet been started by the VA. May we include those projects under the requirement of  completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years?    (Answer) If your firm has completed or substantially completed the contracted design work, you may include it as an example. 
(Question) In the case of projects related to building systems (e.g., water and wastewater distribution, chiller replacement, electrical distribution), actual square footage is not usually supplied by the SOW, particularly when the project is to  Replace HVAC in Bldgs 1, 3, and 7  (or some such). How would you like us to address square footage in these cases, since the RFP states that  Example projects shall note project s square footage.    (Answer) You may submit N/A for the square footage or provide a descriptor that will indicate the scope and complexity of the work, such as linear feet, tons of cooling, etc.
(Question) We are puzzling over the language in this item: All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed for each team member proposed to manage and/or perform work under this contract.  To what does this refer? Because of where it is listed in the set of Selection Criteria, it appears to state that every team member must have completed every project listed in Section F. Perhaps this is a requirement that projects listed in the resumes (Section E) must also meet the requirement that projects are to have been  completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years?  Please clarify.   (Answer) The intent is that all projects have either been completed or substantially completed and that the team members are listed.
(Question) If our team must provide a non-VA project in Section F, how would you like us to comply with the request for a    contract number of project identification number in block 21?    (Answer) You may submit N/A.
(Question) We are puzzling over the language of the following item:  If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work they provided towards the performance of the overall project.  Does  the contractor  in this instance refer to the prime on this submission? At any rate, how is it you would like the  value of work they provided  to be expressed: in hours? In dollars? In subjective narrative?   (Answer) If your firm served as a subcontractor rather than the prime on the projects listed, please note the amount of work that was performed as a subcontractor. This is typically listed as a dollar amount and may be followed with a narrative describing the disciplines that were provided by your firm as a subcontractor.
(Question) We are requested to provide the contract period of performance? How is it you would like this expressed when there are projects in which the team has fulfilled the professional obligations to date but is still awaiting the VA to put the project under construction so that we may perform post-award construction services?   (Answer) The contract period of performance may be listed as specifically the design services.
(Question) We are also requested to provide the award contract value and the current contract value. The award value is, presumably, the construction budget for the project at the time of award (unless you mean for us to provide the award value for the prime), correct? And the current contract value is . . . the construction cost (presuming the VA released this information to us)? The total of the fee paid to the prime? Please clarify.   (Answer) Your award contract value is the amount of the contract awarded to your firm for design services. The current contract value is the amount of the contract awarded plus any modifications added or deducted during the design process.
(Question) We are puzzling over the language of this item, too:  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the team member/team entity on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.  Given that there is only one page for each project (well, usually that s all we re allowed for Section F), and given that all type is required to be 12 pt Times New Roman or larger, how is it we are to describe the work provided by all involved team members, information about the contract award (see item 6.g and h.), a photo (however small at this point) of the project, and still provide the required information in boxes 21 through 25?   (Answer) Typically, we have not had an issue with firms being able to provide a concise description of the work and their responsibilities.
Under Criterion 3, it is noted that 
(Question)    the firm must be located within the five (5) state region of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota, or Minnesota.  Does this refer to the prime only?   (Answer) Yes.
(Question)  Indicate A/E firm location, including main offices, branch offices and any sub consultants  offices and demonstrate how this will be advantageous to the Government.  Presumably the A/E firm is referring to the prime? Also, what constitutes  advantageous to the Government.  Does this refer to the governing body of the VA, to VISN 23, or to the U.S. Government? (There are many possibilities.  Additionally, please clarify whether it is the location which is to be defended as advantageous or other factors about the firm which are to be defended as advantageous. For example, is it enough for a subcontractor to be an SDVOSB firm in order to be advantageous in this sense?   (Answer) Yes, the A/E firm is referring to the prime. When you are responding to the question of how this is advantageous to the VA, please consider the market that is included in the scope of work. It is not enough for a subcontractor to be an SDVOSB in order to be advantageous.
(Question) Under Criterion 6, it is stated that we must,  Describe the A/E firms [sic] ability to concurrently perform and manage multiple projects in different locations to meet aggressive schedules, multiple disciplines, and control costs and the A/E firms[sic] capacity to accomplish multiple projects simultaneously.  What constitutes an  aggressive  schedule, especially when a prime and its team is already accomplished in concurrent performance and management of multiple projects in different locations while still managing multiple disciplines and controlling costs?   (Answer) Please describe your firm s ability to fast track a project if there is a specific need for an aggressive schedule.
(Question) Under Criterion 7, it is stated that we must,  Describe the A/E firms Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness. [sic]  In attempting to parse the requirements herein, it appears that you are asking the prime to describe their own reputation and standing in terms of performance, management and cooperativeness. How do you propose that any firm would provide an objective response to this item? (It does appear to be rather self-serving.)   (Answer) List specific achievements, awards, recognition for exceptional performance, or any other information about the A/E firm and its principal officials that can be used to evaluate the reputation and standing of the firm.
(Question) Under Criterion 8, it is stated that we must,  List the record of signification claims, if any, against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.  Does this apply to the prime only? If we are required to fulfill this list for our other team members, how would you propose we answer this? As an aside, all claims are treated as  significant  because even a frivolous legal action is recorded and must be defended, even if it is settled for a nuisance value. Will the evaluation team take into account these conditions if we must report on all firms on our team?   (Answer) The firm applies to the prime only. The firm may provide a narrative in regards to claims listed if necessary. Claims against firms other than the prime will not be held against the prime and do not need to be addressed.
(Question) Under Criterion 9, it is stated that we must list our    record of working together as a team.  In order to provide the team that we feel is most advantageous to the VA in terms of experience and location, we are proposing firms that have VA experience but not with our firm. So, the question is whether work together as a team is more important that experience in working with the VA?   (Answer) As noted in Paragraph D: Evaluation Criteria (1) through (3) are considered most important and equal among themselves, while Criteria (4) through (9) are the least important and listed in descending order of importance.
With regard to submission requirements: 
(Question) Is it possible that the number of pages can be expanded in order to account for the number of resumes and Part II forms necessary to assemble a team that can provide services as well as redundancy?  (Answer) No. Our team members are quite experienced, and we will need space to list their qualifications as a firm (i.e., experience in the types of projects described in the Statement of Work) and as individuals (professional certifications and training). A maximum of 85 pages wouldn t go amiss, and I can promise you that I don t fill up space with brochure copy.   (Answer) The number of pages will not be expanded.
(Question) Regarding the 12 pt Times New Roman requirement, we have been allowed in the past to use a smaller font on the Part II forms as well as for the list items in the SF330 forms (e.g., 1. TITLE AND LOCATION (City and State), which appears as the first box of information requested in the SF330 Part I form). Is this still acceptable?   (Answer) Please follow the instructions as directed.

<p>The Period of Performance (POP) includes a Base Year Period (to include a 90-day transition period) and Nine (9) 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>POP: 01/15/2018 to 01/14/2028</p>
<p>Description:<br />(1) National Stock Number (NSN): N/A</p>

<p>(3) Manufacturer, including part number, drawing number, etc.: N/A</p>
<p>(4) Size, dimensions, or other form, fit or functional description:</p>
<p>The United States (US) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established a contract with ASRC FEDERAL FIELD SERVICES LLC, located in Beltsville, MD to provide high quality comprehensive center-wide support services at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). The Contractor shall provide labor, management, supervision, equipment, software, firmware, and materials (except those items which are Government furnished) for all services required for the safe, reliable, effective, efficient and compliant operations in support of the scientific mission at PIADC under normal, abnormal and emergency conditions.<br />The contractor shall manage, operate, and maintain PIADC's operational and scientific support activities for the Government. The intent of this contract consolidation was to maximize efficiencies, streamline lines of authority, and reduce risk at PIADC.</p>
<p>The DHS Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ONL has responsibility for the safe, reliable, secure, efficient and compliant operations of PIADC, which is located on Plum Island, New York, an 840-acre island located approximately one and one-half miles from the eastern end of Long Island's North Fork. Transportation to and from PIADC is provided by a Government-owned, Contractor-operated ferry from both New York and Connecticut. Collectively, about 400 Federal and contracted personnel currently work at PIADC with approximately 50% of the employees residing in New York and the remaining 50% residing in Connecticut. Current Federal and contracted personnel represent a variety of disciplines including scientific, animal care, administrative, financial, operations and maintenance management and staff, occupational health, security, and construction staff.<br />The operability of the PIADC Facility must be maintained on a 24/7 basis. The scientific workday typically occurs during normal business hours Monday-Friday (approximately 6AM - 6PM). However, the scientific work is routinely extended beyond those hours and, during other non-business hours including weekends. Contracted services are required to support high priority diagnostic work (e.g. transportation, courier services, and animal care).</p>
<p>Description of Facilities:</p>
<p>PIADC refers to the 840 acre Plum Island as well as the Orient Point, NY Facility which is approximately 9 acres. PIADC is largely self-sufficient. The physical and operational infrastructure are, in many respects, similar to what would be required to support a small town, including potable water and waste water, steam, and back-up power generation.<br />The majority of research, diagnostics and training conducted at PIADC occur within Building 101 biocontainment , which is approximately 200,000 square feet and includes Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3), Biosafety Level 3 Agriculture (BSL-3 Ag), Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL-3) and associated equipment and machinery spaces. Research is also conducted in Building 100 in two Biosafety Level (BSL-2) laboratory suites (each approximately 2,200 square feet). Building 102 is an additional biocontainment space that houses the current effluent thermal decontamination plant. A new Waste Water Thermal Decontamination System (WWTDS) is under construction (transition to the new system is expected to occur in 2016). A significant part of the biocontainment facilities are more than 50 years old.</p>
<p>A 55,000 square foot administrative Building 100, which is connected to the biocontainment Facility, provides office space, meeting rooms, an auditorium, and a cafeteria. Approximately 70,000 square feet of additional support buildings provide space for systems, equipment, storage and other items and services to support the PIADC mission</p>

<AWDDATE>091615
<ARCHDATE>12292017
<DESC>The modification is to increase the ceiling for contract N66001-15-D-0341.  The contract is a three year, single-award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) performance- based service contract with a cost plus fixed fee (services) pricing structure.
The existing contract exceeded initial cost projections due to increased requirements from the principal sponsor (PMW-160) in support of existing programs and aggressive timelines.  Increased work load/requirements included transitioning the software load/installation and SOVT from the Fleet Readiness Directorate (FRD) Installation Office (FIO) to TACNET for the following systems: Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Automated Digital Network System (ADNS), and Operation Rolling Tide (ORT/Legacy Network Upgrades).  Additionally, increased work load/requirement included Computer Network Defense Tools Assured Compliance Assessment Solution (ACAS) and Super-Agent Distributed Repository (SADR) technical and engineering support, ORT engineering solutions, new System Operability Verification Testing and development (SOVT), CANES, ADNS, ORT Post Installation Training, Integrated Logistics Support for newly installed systems, significant increase in SPAWAR FRD Lead System of Systems Testing (SOT), and increased onboard Technical Assists/Casualty Reporting (CASREP).  Such work, while within the scope of this contract, was unforeseen in the volume actually realized.
There are no other viable existing contracts available to support the requirements for the type of work performed by TACNET CB-ISEA.
Contractor's expertise, experience, and familiarity performing as the primary TACNET contractor over the past fourteen years have allowed the contractor to develop the skills sets and knowledge to complete the work required, with continuity, for the effort required under this ceiling increase.  Contractor has been developing and deploying Navy C4I Systems for more than twenty three years, and related PEO C4I systems for more than ten years.
This ceiling increase is necessary to provide continuance of TACNET support until the competitive follow-on action is completed, which is currently in process.  Not executing this ceiling increase will cause unacceptable delays, disrupting TACNET services vital to PEO C4I Navy support for fielded systems through End-of-Life (EOL) replacement, distant support, on-site repair, and system analysis.
Any interruption of TACNET ISEA support would result in the unacceptable degradation of C4I Systems and Networks in naval ships and submarines across the fleet and negatively affect the mission capability of the warfighter.

<DESC>Technical services to operate, maintain, and repair the Research Vessel (R/V) Acoustic Explorer (A/X) for the Sonobuoy Quality Assurance Program (SQAP). Operationally, the typical SQAP deployment schedule is ten (10) deployment days per month. Contracted services provided during SQAP deployments, along with crew support for the vessel include the following: the provision of environmental conditions prior to, during and after each test, analysis of test sample air flight and water entry geometry; deployment, activation, and recovery of the vessel underwater sound source; recovery and evaluation of failed test samples; and, in the absence of a deployment aircraft, the operational setting and deployment of test samples. Routine and unscheduled maintenance, aboard the steel hulled vessel, is accomplished continuously both in-port and at sea. Efforts include, but are not limited to the preparation and preservation of all steel structures; scheduled maintenance of all weight handling equipment to ensure safe and reliable operation; routine maintenance of all propulsion and power generation systems; inspection and certification, as necessary, of all firefighting, weight handling, and lifesaving equipment; and inspection, operation and troubleshooting of all communication, surveillance, and navigation systems.
