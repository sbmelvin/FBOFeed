<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.<br />AFRL requires an upgraded ECD-X frequency doubler for a single solstis pump laser, which is to be compatible with an existing laser system built by M Squared Lasers.<br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with: <br /><br />M Squared Lasers, Inc. <br />Cambridge Innovation Center<br />1 Broadway, 14th Floor,<br />Cambridge, MA 02142, USA
<p>The Government has determined that no other source has commercial offerings that can meet this requirement. The upgraded ECD-X frequency doubler required is customized by the manufacturer to be interoperable with the original operational laser system, to include proprietary software controls and custom built electronics. No other manufacturer has access to this proprietary information and therefore cannot create a compatible system. The upgrade is required for performance of in-house experiments requiring multiple laser wavelengths beyond the tuning range of any one system. This upgrade is required over the purchase of a second system due to size, weight and power restrictions in the in-house laboratory, as well as the need to operate the lasers as a single integrated unit. <br /><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Ashley.Ellinger@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.<br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 28 June 2018.<br /><br />A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed. 
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.

In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source
<p>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source contract under FAR authority FAR 6.302-1 to Assay Technology, Inc., 1382 Stealth St, Livermore, CA. The performance will require the delivery of disk sampling stations, in which the contractor will analyze the environmental exposure data retrieved from the stations. The purpose of this contract is to continue researching the health effects of the enclosed submarine atmosphere through execution of the Submarine Atmosphere Health Assessment Program (SAHAP). SAHAP deploys passive chemical dosimeters (sampling stations) onboard US Navy submarines to determine concentrations of various compounds in the atmosphere; then compares them to established Navy 90-day limits. The Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) requires contracted laboratory support to manufacture and analyze the custom chemical dosimeters, which are necessary to sample the atmosphere in the dynamic submarine environment, on an as-needed basis.<br /><br />NSMRL will order up to 1250 custom sampling stations from the contractor per year. The quantity and type of sampling stations in each order may vary. Custom Sampling Stations ordered by the government shall be manufactured and delivered within three (3) weeks of the order date. NSMRL shall return up to 1250 samples to the contractor following the exposure period for analysis. Analysis of custom sampling stations that are returned to the contractor after exposure shall be completed within three (3) weeks of receipt. Upon completion of analysis, the contractor shall report the outcome of the analysis in the form specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). <br />The estimated period of performance is for a 12-month base period plus four, 12-month option periods, for a total of 60 months of performance. <br /><br />This procurement supports ongoing research under the SAHAP program. Utilizing a variety of sampling stations and forms of measurement from a different supplier would cause disparities in data samples, which would compromise the validity of the SAHAP studies. Therefore, NAVMEDLOGCOM intends to award this requirement as a sole source to Assay Technology, Inc. via a firm-fixed price, single award indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle.</p>
<p>A sources sought notice was issued on 02 February 2018 for this requirement and the Government determined after the review of capability statements, that no other source had the capability to perform the required work.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 5 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>

The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 236220 General Contractors   Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The small business size standard is $36.5 million.  The solicitation will be issued as a 100% set-aside to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a firm fixed-price, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a non-commercial item.  

The construction IDIQ contracts shall provide general construction work at an indefinite quantity by placing individual task orders with the contractors within minimum and maximum limitations of $2,000.00 - $500,000.00 per task order.  The maximum contract value for each IDIQ contract is $5,000,000.00 for the base year and $5,000,000.00 per each exercised option year.  The contractual vehicle will be a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract.  The minimum guarantee for each IDIQ is $2,000.00 per contract awardee which meets the FAR 16.5 requirement.

The prospective contractors must fully demonstrate their abilities as well as specific expertise in concurrently managing a variety of construction projects, in a manner that complies with all applicable regulations and laws and within the time frame required.  The government will evaluate all firms using source selection procedures in order to determine the firm s experience in providing the type of work, experience of key personnel, past performance and quality, subcontracting, and schedule and cost control.  After award is made, the contractor s performance under individual task orders will be monitored both on site and through periodic performance evaluations as required.  The performance standards of the construction services being acquired are published via specifications, drawings, and statutory contractual requirements which flow from the basic IDIQ contract to each issued task order and they relate to the need by virtue of the fact the aforementioned statutory requirements are established in regulation, directives, law, etc.

The Solicitation shall state that Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Government may award to other than the lowest price offerors or other than the highest technically rated offerors in order to select the contractors whose offers represent the best value to the Government (FAR 15.101-1).

Technical Risks. The Government's technical risks will be reduced through the selection process. The prospective firms must fully demonstrate their capabilities as well as specific expertise in the construction skills required. The Government's risk will also be reduced by quality assurance reviews performed by the Government s technical personnel. If the contractor's performance is less than satisfactory, there is no obligation to place work with the contractor after the guaranteed minimum stated in the contract is satisfied. This provides a strong incentive for the contractor to provide consistently high quality construction. The risk to the Government is essentially limited to the minimum guaranteed amount for 
the IDIQ award. There is no obligation for the government to pay more than the minimum guarantee.

Scheduling Risks. Scheduling risks are directly impacted by a firm's ability to manage effectively. 
Any other scheduling risks will be minimized significantly by closely screening the firm's corporate 
structure, experience, and technical capabilities/experience of the individuals to be involved with the resultant contract during the selection process to ensure that acceptable performance has been demonstrated and the planned management team is fully qualified. 

The successful performance for each task order will be evaluated through the use of the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), performance evaluations and close monitoring of each task order by the Government's Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). Contractors will become familiar with the government process and way of doing business, as the IDIQ progresses.  

Market research has been conducted in the VetBiz Registry and the Small Business Administration (SBA) website for construction contractors for NAICS codes 236220. Searches of the SBA and VetBiz websites yielded the following information: 

INDIANA:   VetBiz: 98    SBA: 26
MICHIGAN:   VetBiz: 107    SBA: 59
OHIO:   VetBiz: 123    SBA: 48
Based on market research, there is a reasonable expectation of receiving two or more responses from responsible SDVOSB contractors for each location. Therefore, the acquisition shall be a total set-aside for SDVOSB. 
The Government contemplates award of approximately 10 Firm Fixed Price IDIQ JOCs, resulting in Firm Fixed Price Task Order Awards. Coefficients will be established for the base year contract and each exercised option year. The unit price book, RS Means will be updated annually.  

Source-Selection procedures: Awards will be made based on technical and past performance evaluation factors and price. The solicitation will state that Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price. A best value determination will be made based on those evaluation factors. A technical evaluation team will be established and the source selection plan will be distributed to the team. The solicitation will clearly identify the evaluation factors, as well as the evaluation criteria. The technical evaluation will determine Contractors' capabilities.

The flow of source selection evaluation will be in the following order: 
1) technical proposal without pricing 
2) past performance 
3) pricing data 

Contractors will be allowed to propose on multiple locations   separate proposals will be required for each location being proposed. 

The government wishes to award multiple contracts.  Contractors who fail to show capability in their proposal may be eliminated in the procurement process. Negotiations under FAR Part 15 will permit the government to hold discussions, as determined by the Contracting Officer, with offerors whose proposal may require additional information and resubmission in order to correctly reflect their capabilities and thereby qualify for award of a contract.

A Pre-Proposal conference and site visit will be announced in the Solicitation.  Details for registering for the conference will be available in the solicitation.  Interested contractors are encouraged to attend and should register in accordance with the requirements to be provided in the solicitation.  The solicitation closing date is to be determined.  Actual dates and times will be identified in the solicitation.  All information, amendments and questions concerning this solicitation will be electronically posted at the following we page:  http://www.fbo.gov.

DISCLAIMER:  The official plans and specification are located on the official government web page and the Government is not liable for information furnished by any other source.  Amendment, if/when issued will be posted to http://www.fbo.gov/ for electronic downloading.  This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments prior to closing; therefore, it is the offerors responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to the solicitation.  Websites are occasionally inaccessible due to various reasons.  The Government is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offerors inability to access the documents posted on the referenced web pages.  The Government will not issue paper copies.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION. This announcement constitutes a PRE-SOLICITATION notice in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District hereby announces its intent to issue a solicitation for AERIAL VEGETATION CONTROL SPRAYING BY HELICOPTER. This solicitation is RESTRICTED TO SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION ONLY, under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 115112. The corresponding SBA size standard is $7.5MIL.<br /><br />A formal solicitation via a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items will be issued no sooner than 15 days from the publication date of this announcement. The RFP will be issued as a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Aerial Spraying by helicopter.
<p>The basis for award and evaluation factors will be in accordance with the evaluation criteria outlined in the solicitation. This requirement will be awarded as firm-fixed price. The Government intends to award one (1) contract as a result of this solicitation. The duration of the resulting contract will include a base year and 4 options years. Task Orders of varying dollar amounts will be awarded within a period extending up to five years. Contractors shall be required to perform to a performance work statement, but in general the type and nature of the requirements will be in accordance with the " Description of Services" section within this announcement below.</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:<br />This is a Services Contract for helicopter spraying of vegetation on sandbars in the Missouri River at Lake Oahe and from Pickstown, SD to Ponca, NE. The aquatic herbicides that need to be applied require helicopter spraying services as opposed to aerial (airplane) spraying services, due to the herbicide label requirements. Many of the areas to be sprayed prohibit the use of ATVs, tractors and other types of spraying equipment. <br /><br />Threatened and endangered shorebirds nest on these sandbars, so spraying must occur after the birds leave, normally around Labor Day. Spraying must also occur before a hard freeze occurs, normally in early October. Therefore, the contractor has approximately one month to render services.</p>
<p>Please be advised of on-line registration requirements in the System for Award Management (SAM) database http://www.sam.gov/ and directed solicitation provisions concerning electronic annual Representations and Certifications. Representations and Certifications are required to be updated annually as a minimum to keep information current, accurate and complete.

<p>Written responses should be sent to Dr. Bowman no later than June 29, 2018 3:00pm EST&nbsp; to addresses provide above for inclusion in a summary technology report.</p>
<p>The Joint Information Operations Warfare Center (JIOWC) is establishing requirements to support the emerging domain of Operations in the Information Environment. A Capability Based Assessment (CBA) has identified four Concept Requirement Capabilities (CRC's), identified below, each consisting of sub-ordinate task requirements. The CRCs and the supporting sub-tasks are identified below:</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES<br />A. Required Capabilities to Characterize and Assess the Informational, Physical, and Human Aspects of the Security Environment. The Joint Force requires the ability to:<br />A.1 Determine impact of relevant informational, physical, and human aspects of the security environment on Joint Force objectives.<br />A.2 understand the perceptions and attitudes that drive behaviors that affect JFC's objectives.  <br />A.3 understand how relevant actors are successful in adapting their use of information technology.<br />A.4 share contextual understanding of the security environment.<br />A.5 characterize, assess, synthesize, and understand trends of relevant actor activities and their impacts on the IE throughout cooperation, competition, and conflict.<br />A.6 analyze and estimate relevant change within the IE.<br />A.7 identify, access, and manage IE subject matter expertise.<br />A.8 understand internal and other relevant actor bias within the IE.<br />B. Required Capabilities to Formulate Options that Integrate Physical and Informational Power. The Joint Force requires the ability to: <br />B.1 identify, optimize and assess the effectiveness of the full range of options that integrate physical and informational power to produce desired psychological effects.<br />B.2 employ required forces and capabilities from across the Joint Force to sustain or change perceptions and attitudes that drive desired behaviors of relevant actors.<br />B.3 assess relevant actors' capability and capacity to receive, understand, and respond to Joint Force physical and informational activities.<br />C. Required Capabilities to Execute and Modify Options. The Joint Force requires the ability to: <br />C.1 execute integrated physical and informational activities designed to achieve psychological effects.<br />C.2 assess and modify informational power with the same level of competency as physical power.<br />D. Required Capabilities to Institutionalize the Integration of Physical and Informational Power. The Joint Force requires the ability to: <br />D.1 change how its individuals, organizations, and units think about and treat information.<br />D.2 organize, train, equip, and maintain organizations that deliberately leverage the informational aspects of military activities.<br />D.3 integrate operations with inter-organizational partners.<br />D.4 leverage physical and informational power at its discretion to achieve objectives.</p>
<p>The Joint Concept for Operations in the Information Environment provides a detailed review of the CRCs. This document is available upon written request to Dr. Bowman.</p>
<p>ARL is conducting a technology state-of-the-art review in support of the JIOWC CBA to identify technology readiness levels (TRLs) of existing or emerging systems to support the four CRCs and each of the subordinate requirements. The Information Event will begin with a Government overview of the importance and military relevance of OIE.  This will be followed by a staff overview of the OIE CRCs and sub-tasks that will include discussion and question/answers from the audience. Four CRC subgroups will be formed and led by government advisors to explore the technology requirements in more detail. A technology demonstration opportunity will be offered during the last two hours of day one for attendees to provide technology exemplars.  Days two and three (the number of days will be determined by the number of attendees interested in presenting) will consist of individual briefings by interested participants. Briefings will be organized by CRCs. Presentations shall not exceed 10 minutes to be followed by 5 minutes of questions/answers.</p>
<p>As indicated previously, physical attendance is not required at the Information Event.  If interested parties would like to promote their technology for any of the CRCs, they should send a written description of how the technology addresses one or more CRC or sub-task.  Each description shall not be greater than 100 words and shall include the TRL for the system. The  description shall clearly identify the offerer name, contact information, and identify any operational user groups.</p>

<CONTACT>James C. Graham, Contract Specialist, Phone 2027070734, Email jgraha@loc.gov - Jake von Reyn , Contracting Officer, Phone 202-707-0589, Fax 202-707-8611, Email jare@loc.gov
<DESC>This effort involves research in imaging science to more accurately image objects to match the way the human eye "sees" color, and apply the research to improved methodologies for cultural heritage digitization. These expert services will support two activities. The first is the Library's ongoing digitization program. The second activity pertains to the Library's leadership of the interagency group Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative (FADGI) Still Images Working Group (http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/).

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br /><br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br /><br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the ombudsman, </span></p>

<DESC>RFI
<p>Description:<br />DLA Energy is seeking interested parties to potentially supply all the fuel to include gasoline, diesel, propane and jet fuel (JA-1 and JA-1 with additives) under a contingency basis (due to force majeure) to support DoD and Federal Civilian agencies for a period of one year.  The contingency contract will be effective during the Hurricane Season in south and south east of the United States (Gulf Coast states through lower Atlantic Ocean).  The Southeast United States and the state of Texas when normal delivery conditions cannot be sustained due to extremely adverse conditions and limited fuel sources.  The health, safety and continuity of operations for emergency response teams, hospitals and other life-sustaining missions will require a 24-hour delivery basis.  The Southeast United States covers Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Caroline, Mississippi, Tennessee and Missouri.  Texas is also included only for contingency purposes.  Startup must commence within 24 hours of notice to perform.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit a capability statement that would guarantee product availability and required transportation when the contingency contract replaces the normal contract fuel deliveries to these locations. In the capability statement, the interested party should describe how the program will be managed.</p>
<p>This RFI is for market survey purposes only and does not/will not obligate the U.S. Government, nor the respondents to any contractual relationship.  Interested parties are encouraged to submit one or more concept proposals that address each of the foregoing areas by June 21, 2018.  DLA Energy looks forward to receiving your responses and welcomes your feedback.  Questions may directed to John Parson, DLA Energy, (571) 767-2673, john.parson@dla.mil or Juebiline Mbandi, DLA Energy, (571) 767-8580, juebiline.mbandi@dla.mil.</p>

<p>2.0 MISSION OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The mission consists of an earth-pointing lidar instrument mounted on the ISS JEM-EF. The mission uses two lasers to send pulses into the earth's atmosphere and a receiver telescope to collect the photons returned from the atmosphere. Photon-counting detectors transmit photon data to the instrument electronics, which perform minimal onboard processing before transmitting the data across the ISS data interface for transmission to the ground, and ultimately to the science operations center (SOC) at GSFC. Boresight alignment mechanisms will be operated as necessary to maintain alignment between the transmitted lasers and the receiver telescope field of view. Heat dissipated by the lasers and electronics is transported away from the instrument by the instrument liquid cooling loop which will be connected to the JEM-EF liquid cooling loop.</p>
<p>The instrument must meet JEM-EF accommodation requirements for volume, mass and power, and must adhere to specific electronic, data, and physical interface requirements, including interfaces for the launch vehicle and for the ISS robotic arm that will remove the instrument from the launch vehicle and install it on the JEM-EF, and will un-install the instrument from the JEM-EF and install it in the return vehicle, at the end of the mission. GSFC 420-01-09, EXTERNAL PAYLOADS PROPOSER'S GUIDE to the International Space Station, and, NASDA-ESPC-2900B, JEM Payload Accommodation Handbook, are examples of sources for the JEM requirements for hosted payloads.</p>
<p>2.1 LAUNCH VEHICLE</p>
<p>The launch vehicle and launch services are provided by NASA's ISS program. The likely launch vehicle is a Space-X Falcon 9 with a dragon capsule. The dragon capsule has an instrument transport compartment, the "trunk", which has specific instrument interfaces. The instrument will be delivered to the Space-X processing facility and, after minimal instrument team launch site operations, will be turned over to the Space-X launch site team for integration to the dragon capsule.</p>
<p>2.2 LAUNCH READINESS DATE</p>
<p>The vendor must commit to meeting the launch readiness date specified in the Mission of Opportunity AO. This date is currently expected to be 09/29/2023.</p>
<p>SRR: 8/3/2020 <br />PDR: 5/27/2021 CDR: 2/21/2022 <br />I&amp;T: 10/12/22 - 6/15/2023 <br />Pack &amp; Ship: 6/16 - 6/22/2023 <br />Launch: 09/29/2023</p>

<p>1.2 DESIRED MISSION SERVICES</p>
<p>GSFC is interested in formally establishing a partner to provide the following services for this Early Career Initiative: Research and Development. This will include development and delivery of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) based neural network hardware accelerators, and compilers to support the developed hardware accelerators. The partner will be expected to work closely with GSFC during the development process. All interested parties are required to respond to this POD in accordance with Section 5 below.</p>
<p>1.3 PROPOSAL SUPPORT</p>
<p>No proposal support will be required from selected partner.</p>
<p>2.0 PROJECT OVERVIEW</p>
<p>Imagine a new generation of space exploration with the ability to use the computational approaches behind such advanced artificially intelligent systems as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and a variety of self-driving vehicles. Working with our academic partners, our team will create a system that will allow NASA to leverage the massive investment in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and development that has already been made in the private sector. Industry has spearheaded the use of Artificial Intelligence as an enabling technology with proven results, able to perform machine activities to an accuracy and level of detail that many NASA engineers hunger for. However, the current era of terrestrial AI has bypassed the needs of AI in space. Autonomous vehicles on earth rely heavily on powerful, but power hungry, microprocessors and Graphics Processing Units (GPU) unsuited for space. Similarly, the AI used in advanced speech recognition is not performed locally but remotely, in the cloud.</p>
<p>Optimizing systems to perform these tasks in space requires a different paradigm. Our early career team's proposed solution is not dependent on the next generation space processing capability that has been the assumed development path for space AI. Instead, it utilizes existing radiation tolerant devices by leveraging recent discoveries in how to more effectively perform Machine Learning tasks. In this project we propose to design and build the artificial deep Neural Network Accelerator for Space Hardware that will work reliably in the harsh environment of space. We propose to do this by using a new, unique AI architecture that intelligently redistributes the internal AI processing model to allow us to target radiation hardened FPGA instead of high powered but space-unsuitable GPUs used in the current terrestrial state of the art. This exciting, high potential marriage of new methods with existing hardware can advance the state of the art to create new, advanced opportunities for lunar entry, descent and landing, rover navigation, and scientific discovery and exploration.</p>
<p>3.0 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>3.1 GENERAL</p>
<p>The partner will support GSFC in the development of a general purpose neural network accelerator FPGA core. The accelerator should be able to:</p>
<p>&bull; Compute feed forward neural networks of several types including:<br />o Fully Connected (or Dense)<br />o Recurrent<br />o Convolutional</p>
<p>&bull; Handle direct memory transfers of both user data and model weights</p>
<p>&bull; Be programmable in a high level API such as Google's TensorFlow</p>
<p>Included in this work is a compiler backend that will target the new accelerator core. This will serve the purpose of translating high level TensorFlow function calls to the low level microcode being run in the accelerator. A compiler is necessary to enable to usage of TensorFlow with the accelerator to enable a much simpler and more flexible NN design process and also to allow for the usage of preexisting TensorFlow NN models like GoogLeNet or Visual Geometry Group Neural Network (VGGnet).</p>
<p>4.0 POD RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS, FORMAT, AND SELECTION CRITERIA</p>
<p>4.1 INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>The respondent shall:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide information on proven previous FPGA designs which demonstrate knowledge and skill suited to this particular task. Previous work should be relevant to implementing neural networks on FPGAs and the difficulties that entails. For example, designs requiring high performance and highly optimized memory transfers, high clock speeds, and large amounts of arithmetic will be necessary.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate understanding and quantified experience in the design, integration, and testing of the FPGA system proposed. The response shall describe how the proposed accelerator meets the requirements given in Section 3.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate understanding of compilers through previous work in the development, modification and design of compilers.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate experience in building 2D convolution hardware accelerators.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate experience and knowledge of high level synthesis, and its usage in practical applications.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide publications in reputable conferences and journals detailing previous work.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a preliminary budget including expected costs such as estimated FTE required, cost of labor, and required development hardware (e.g. FPGA Development Kits, Test Equipment).</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a brief statement of work defining participation in the ECI.</p>
<p>4.2 FORMAT</p>
<p>The response to this partnership opportunity is limited to 6 pages in not less than 12-point font. Excluded from the page count are the cover letter, title pages, table of contents, and acronym list.

     T-45 Physiological Episodes Root Cause Analytics Project (PERCAP), Phase II

DISCLAIMER:

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

INTRODUCTION:

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Contracts Department, Orlando, Florida has a requirement to procure the services necessary to provide artificial intelligence based data analytic services for the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), PMA-273.
 NAVAIR has ongoing efforts to identify and address Physiological Episodes (PEs) involving T-45 aircrew. PEs occur when aircrew are physically impaired, experiencing decreased performance due to a variety of factors. This safety issue has senior leadership visibility and requires all options be explored to support the necessary actions to address PEs and determine root cause. NAVAIR lacked the capability to utilize machine/cognitive learning to conduct associative analysis and modeling (rather than traditional, rules based linear data modeling) of disparate and incomplete data sets (both structured and unstructured). To address these capability shortfalls and to apply machine/cognitive learning to the T-45 PE phenomenon, NAVAIR contracted to design and implement an example of an Associative Learning platform in NAVAIR spaces as a pilot program.
 This pilot effort is termed PERCAP Phase I, with services being performed by Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, CA under N6134017P0058, through September 2018. The PERCAP Phase I system is a completely stand-alone system (disconnected from any other systems or networks), and utilizes a set of static data sources, supplied by the Government. Additionally, the system hardware and software are hosted at a Government facility, and designed to be operated independently by Government or designated contractor personnel.

The purpose of this Phase II effort is to build upon the existing PERCAP Phase I system, its results and data connections, by increasing the systems data ingestion size and types and to transition the system from a stand-alone environment to a networked environment.
 For additional information see Attachment (1) Statement of Work, Attachment (2) GFP List, and Attachment (3) Cyber Security Requirements for details.

Anticipated Time Frame:
Estimated delivery date for all required hardware after Award: 90 days (3 months) After contract award (ACW)
Estimated completion of software design after Award: 270 days (9 months) ACW

REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:

1. The interested party shall provide a response that demonstrates their capability to provide hardware IAW the following specific requirements:
a. Ownership of delivered Hardware will be transferred to the US Government, and will be installed on-site (at NAS Patuxent River, MD) by the contractor.
b. Hardware required to implement the solution must be able to be procured and installed (ready for installation/implementation of software solution) within 3 months after contract award.
 Hardware utilized in PERCAP I may be provided as GFE as is, if desired (See Attachment (2)).
c. Hardware shall be capable of supporting up to 4 TB of source data, as well as any metadata or new data sources created from said source data.
d. Hardware shall be compatible with the physical space configuration outlined in Attachment (1), located in the Data Fusion lab, BLDG 2272, NAS Patuxent River, MD.
e. Hardware shall be able to utilize a network architecture that is capable of meeting DoD cybersecurity requirements for connection to one or more US Government Wide Area Networks, such as NIPRNET, DREN, RDT and E, or NMCI. Additional Cyber Security requirements are provided in Attachment (3).
2.
 The interested party shall provide a response that demonstrates their capability to provide an installed software solution that can perform the following tasks:
a. Software solution shall be compatible with ingestion of data stored in a variety of frameworks, such as Hadoop and Microsoft SQL Server 2008/2014.
b. Accept/ingest structured and unstructured data, from disparate and/or incomplete data sets, in a variety of formats (e.g., .DOC, .PDF, .XLS, .XML, .JPG, .PPT, .RDF, .CSV, binary), of up to 4 TB of source data.
c. Utilize developed algorithms, and machine/cognitive/associative learning to:
i. Identify, predict, and correct errors in source data, to include identification of conflicts, inconsistencies, and gaps in said data.
ii.
 Develop associations/linkages between specific data attributes within, and between, each data source, with context and pattern recognition/correlation capability for linked attributes.
iii. Incorporate design modifications to correct/normalize free text typographical errors.
iv. Provide time reasonable responses to freeform and/or unplanned queries/hypothesis, as well as predictive modeling capabilities. Time reasonableness may be evaluated based on examples provided by the contractor of similar efforts and should provide significant time savings relative to estimates of the time required to produce similar results using traditional data analytics methods (e.g. manual data mining).
d. Provide native data visualization and evaluation tools, for presentation of query and analysis results.

<CONTACT>Gregory D. Schroeder, Contract Specialist, Email gregory.schroeder@navy.mil - Rana Movahed, Contracting Officer, Email Rana.S.Movahed@navy.mil
<DESC>Summary:  This Industry Day announcement and Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the Department of Navy (DoN), on behalf of the Program Manager for the Strategic &amp; Theater Sealift Program Office (PMS385) for information and planning purposes only. PMS385 is conducting market research in support of Strategic Sealift and Auxiliary Ship requirements development. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this announcement/RFI. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with attending industry day, providing information in response to this request for information or any follow up information requests. Responses, however, will be used to inform requirements assessment and acquisition strategy.
<p>Background:  Today the Navy relies on an aging Fleet of auxiliaries and sealift vessels built over several generations and approaching end of service life.  An era of rapid technological advancement requires a different approach to capturing requirements and ensuring future flexibility.  Evolving threats and future warfighting challenges require multi-mission ships that provide improved operational depth.  Expanding the number of distributed sea bases supporting expeditionary logistics, medical response, and command &amp; control to keep the Fleet forward in the fight is critical.  The Navy's new construction plan includes a domestic common-hull design to replace aging mission specific sealift and auxiliary designs to reduce life cycle costs, leverage reconfigurable force packages and stabilize the industrial base.  Additional potential missions include: sealift, aviation intermediate maintenance support, medical services, command &amp; control, and submarine tending.  The common hull auxiliary multi-mission ship will be a non-developmental program complying with American Bureau of Shipping Rules and U. S. Coast Guard Regulations.  It will utilize Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems and equipment.  <br />It is intended that the common hull auxiliary multi-mission ship will be able to support Roll-on/Roll-off (RO/RO) movement of combat equipment and expanded missions through the use of force packages including, but not limited to the following:<br />&bull;	Accommodations to include single to six man staterooms, dormitory-style spaces and Medical facilities (including surgical facilities and O2 generation)<br />&bull;	Industrial shops<br />&bull;	Aviation intermediate maintenance facilities<br />&bull;	Command and control and associated communications facilities, equipment and antennas<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDUSTRY DAY</span></strong></p>
<p>The Navy will hold an Industry Day to provide additional information on the common hull auxiliary multi-mission platform concept, its capabilities and design methodology.  Industry Day will provide opportunities to answer questions and clarify any of the notional ship characteristics and/or force package capabilities.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will be held on 23 May 2018 from 1000-1200 at CSRA, 1201 M Street SE, Washington DC 20003.  Directions to the CSRA building will be provided upon registration.  On the day of the event, visitors will need to check in on the 4th floor of the CSRA building.</p>
<p>Attendance is voluntary and not required to respond to the RFI; however registration is required to attend the Industry Day. Registration is free, however, space is limited. Each organization is requested to limit attendance to three (3) people who must be U.S. Citizens. Organizations should register no later than 18 May 2018.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, NOR SPECIFICATIONS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.
<p>The Norfolk District, Corps of Engineers is seeking qualified, experienced firms capable of performing dredging of approximately 25,000 cubic yards of maintenance material from the Queens Creek Federal Navigation Project located in Mathews County, Virginia. The dredged material, primarily consisting of sand, will be dredged and hydraulically placed by pipeline on a nearby shoreline. A hydraulic cutter-head dredge and support equipment is intended to be used to accomplish this work. Maximum dredging contract pay depths will be to -8 feet. Placement of dredged material on the nearby shoreline will require sufficient horsepower to pump the dredged material through the pipeline length to the shoreline, which is approximately 3,000 feet.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36/DFARs 236, the estimated construction price range for this project is between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00. NAICS Code 237990 applies. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.</p>
<p>In addition to the examining criteria detailed in FAR 9.104-1 - Contractor Qualifications: General Standards, the Contracting Officer will also examine whether the low bidder can meet the requirements of two Definitive Responsibility Criteria regarding: 1) experience in shallow draft dredging, specifically experience in hydraulic pipeline dredging, and 2) experience in shoreline and beach placement of dredge material in bay and coastal environments. Bidders can use one or more projects per work component to demonstrate past experience. If a subcontractor will be used to complete the work, the subcontractor must demonstrate his experience in that work component.</p>
<p>The Firm's response to this Synopsis shall be limited to five (5) pages and shall include the following information.</p>

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor is responsible to perform inspection and repair of the firestop barriers and smoke barrier walls in Building 111 and 144 as shown on the multiple drawings supplied by the VAMC. The approximate square footage of the building is 902,605.  

The Medical Center requires Hilti fire stopping product so no other manufacturer is acceptable. This is done for continuity of firestopping throughout the medical center for current and future firestopping deficiencies. 


SCOPE OF WORK

Base Year:

Inspection of fire/smoke rated barrier walls as noted on the plans.  Walls included: Rated barrier walls are located via facility provided Statement of Condition (also known as Life Safety) drawings only.

1 Hour Fire Barriers, to include floors and walls
2 Hour Fire/Smoke Barriers, to include floors and walls
1 Hour Fire/Smoke Barriers, to include floors and walls
30 Minute Smoke Barriers, to include floors and walls
Smoke Resistive Hazardous Areas, to include floors and walls

NOTE: Inspection and repairs may occur at the same time or separately, it is dependent on the contractor. If the contractor chooses to inspect and repair separately, the contractor has forty-eight (48) hours after the completion of the inspection to submit a repair schedule to the COR for approval. Additional information on the Hilti UL System and requirements for each type of barrier can be found at https://www.hilti.com/firestops. 

Contractor must notify the COR immediately if unable to access an area to inspect/repair.

Hard lid gypsum ceiling investigation (81) 
Inspect the rated barrier above the hard ceilings - up to 81 locations. 
Contractor must provide the most minimally invasive option per location to gain 
access for inspection 
 Drill small holes 5/8  to use scope camera 
Holes will be repaired post inspection 

Wall Repairs, if required 
Partial Wall Removal
Repair areas may require small partial wall removal as preparation 
Metal Studs 
Install metal stud, top and bottom track where appropriate in accordance with UL classified U300, U400 or V400 series 1hour or 2 hour Fire/Smoke rated barriers. 
Penetrations will be framed out appropriately according to the specific UL Firestop System. 
Gypsum Board 
Install and fire tape type X 5/8  fire rated gypsum board in accordance with UL classified U300, U400 or V400 series 1 hour or 2- hour Fire/Smoke rated walls.

Install CMU block or other material compatible where appropriate with the wall type being repaired in accordance with UL classified lightweight or normal weight (100-150 pcf) concrete or concrete block.
Removal of Foreign Material
Installation of firestop systems may require removal of foreign material (including, but not limited to, drywall mud, mortar, spray foam, fireproofing and structolite) to create required annular space to accept the appropriate firestop system. 
Installation 
Sealing and correcting penetrations/joints.  Ensure all products have good adhesion and penetrations and joints are sealed completely.  Only penetrations within the large wall repair areas will be corrected 
Repair of existing walls and partitions to include but not limited to caulking, taping and mudding of wall and ceiling repairs to ensure rated and non-rated enclosures conform to the required ratings as required by code.

Infection Control
Contractor is required to follow all infection control procedures for the area of the inspection to include using a portable containment and/or plastic barriers.  The facility will provide the infection control levels of every area in the building.  See Statement of Condition (also known as Life Safety) drawings.
Infectious Control Barriers are dependent on the work being performed and patient risk group.  Corridors must remain a minimum 5 Ft. wide, shark tanks/HEPA carts/infection control carts are acceptable to allow for ceiling tile removal in corridors.  An ICRA will be required for all work. (See Attachment A within  Memorandum FMD-058 Infection Control Risk Assessments (ICRA) for Work Orders, dated January 2017  for work conditions not requiring an Infection Control Permit or Review.)

Engineering Judgments
When field conditions are outside the parameters of an UL tested system, an engineering judgment will be obtained from the manufacturer (Hilti) and installed. 
Non-standard methods will require an engineering judgement from Hilti and an explanation as to why this is required. This documentation will be reviewed by the Medical Center.
It is anticipated that 20% of the firestops will need engineering judgment from Hilti.
The Contractor must notify the COR immediately when Engineering Judgements have been requested from Hilti and must provide the COR with a copy of the documentation submitted to Hilti.

NOTE: Hilti does not charge for engineering judgement when using their products. There should be no additional charge to the contractor from the vendor and results can be expected within five (5) days of acknowledge submittal to Hilti.

Documentation During Inspection
All information will be recorded electronically using a computer program (Electronic Drawings-based tracking and verification program) that utilizes Statement of Condition (also known as Life Safety) drawings to denote all inspection points and deficiency locations. The VA will be provided access to the program and be able to download the drawings, notes, and inspection information. Opening any of the marks on the drawings will display a page detailing the deficiency type, U.L. System deployed, product used, wall type, and date/time of repair, as well as before and after pictures. 

Contractor is required to identify, as part of the wall inspection, the Fire/Smoke walls that are not labeled and provide this information in the final report and in the computer program.

Additional Information:
Noise restrictions are dependent on the areas. On in-patient wards, loud noise between 9 pm and 6 am is not acceptable.  Near the ORs (2nd floor) and procedure rooms (EP Lab/Cath Lab/Angio, etc.) loud drilling during the day when procedures are taking place is not approved.
The VA follows NFPA and other applicable national codes and standards.  The VA is its own AHJ.  Any specifics are found at www.cfm.va.gov/index.asp

1.3.7. Conflict of Interest:  The Contractor shall not assign any person who is an employee of the United States Government to work under this contract if that employment would appear to cause a conflict of interest.

<RESPDATE>061118
<ARCHDATE>06122018
<CONTACT>WASHINGTONI NLN, Email washingtoni.NLN@ars.usda.gov
<DESC>The USDA ARS - WBSC intends to award a sole source <strong>Firm Fixed Purchase Order (PO) to COREBIOME, INC, 25 Langford Park, St. Paul, MD 55108-1910</strong>. This order will purchase <strong>CoreBiome BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup> Shotgun Sequencing &amp; DNA Extraction</strong> in support of the ongoing research at USDA ARS, Western Health Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC), Obesity and Metabolism Unit (OMU), 430 West Health Sciences Drive, Davis, CA. <br /><br />
<p><strong>The Firm Fixed PO will include the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. CoreBiome Extraction</strong><br />&bull; MoBio PowerFecal DNA isolation kit</p>
<p><strong>2. CoreBiome BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup> Shotgun Sequencing<br /></strong>&bull; Library preparation and QC from extracted DNA.<br />&bull; Whole-genome shotgun sequencing using Illumina NextSeq 1x145 single-end reads<br />&bull; Mean read depth of 0.5 million sequences per sample. Not all QC-validated samples will achieve the mean depth: o &ge; 95% of samples &gt; 0.25M reads (50% of specification), excludes samples failing prior QC</p>
<p><strong>3. CoreBiome Core Analysis Online Report</strong><br />&bull; Raw FASTQ data<br />&bull; Trimmed, adaptor-removed FASTA data<br />&bull; Quality-control dashboard<br />&bull; Strain- and species-level taxonomic assignments via alignment to a curated reference database.<br />&bull; Direct functional profiling via alignment to a curated reference database, reported as KEGG orthology groups, modules, and pathways where available.<br />&bull; Best-practice diversity analysis and data visualization</p>
<p>CoreBiome created a process called <strong><em>BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup></em></strong>. BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup> is "shallow shotgun" sequencing method using illumina techology used to profile the composition of the microbiome, providing species-level or strain-level resolution. Based on the algorithms developed in the lab of computational biologist Dr. Dan Knights at the University of Minnesota, BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup> uses very shallow (low-coverage) shotgun sequencing to recover the full species-level taxonomic and functional repertoire. BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup> gives far superior taxonomic and functional profiles to 16S sequencing because their software is able to use 10% or more of observed sequences as species level markers, achieving rich coverage of microbiome composition even at very low sequencing depths.</p>
<p>Overall Performance of BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup> - <em><strong>Sequencing output and Sensitivity:</strong></em> BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup> is built on a foundation of standard shotgun nextgeneration sequencing, powered by proprietary library creation, sequencing, and advanced informatics. Sequencing executed on the Illumina HiSeq platform in single-end, 1x100-bp sequencing mode at a depth of approximately 250,000-500,000 sequences per sample. In a typical human gut microbiome sample BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup> recovers approximately 50,000 species-level markers, for detection of species at an abundance of 0.04%. This is similar sensitivity to BenchMark<sup>TM</sup>, but with better taxonomic and functional resolution.</p>
<p><strong><em>Analysis:</em></strong> CoreBiome provides customers with full primary data analysis and annotation, including species-level and putative strain-level taxonomy tables, KEGG metabolic pathway and module tables predicted the Knights Lab's SHOGUN tool (expected to have substantially higher accuracy than PICRUSt predictions from 16S sequencing), beta diversity analyses (Bray-Curtis distance at different taxonomic levels, strain-level weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances), and alpha diversity analysis (Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, and whole-tree phylogenetic diversity). Customers also have access to raw demultiplexed sequencing data.</p>
<p>USDA ARS, WHNRC is attaining the <strong>BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup> Sequencing &amp; DNA Extraction</strong> in support of their primary goal of the Obesity and Metabolism Unit (OMU), which is to identify the sources of variation that predispose a person to increased adiposity and body weight. One critical source is the composition and function of the gut bacteria. The sequencing project proposed is aimed at understanding the functional composition of the microbiota (the bacteria themselves and the genes they contain) which are related to physiological traits like adiposity and body weight. BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup> combines "shallow shotgun" gene sequencing methods with specific analytical algorithms to both profile the composition of the microbiome while providing functional annotation of gene functions. The BoosterShot<sup>TM</sup> methods will provide the Dr. Bennett's lab (OMU scientist) an efficient method to accomplish his research goal.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>The award date will be on or about<strong> June 12, 2018;</strong> and this Notice of Intent is not considered as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposals (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. A determination, by the Government, to compete this proposed PO based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will consider all responses received by<strong> 10:30AM PST, June 11, 2018.</strong> Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to the Primary Point of Contact: <a href="mailto:Washingtoni.NLN@ars.usda.gov">Washingtoni.NLN@ars.usda.gov</a>.</p>

La Isla currently has in place for the Adelante Initiative the logistical support needed for the NIOSH study.. Since La Isla is already providing support for the initiative and the NIOSH study will overlap with the initiative, it would be very difficult for another vendor to coordinate the logistics and to start-up without delay. There are no other vendors that can provide the required logistics and that also have a relationship with the sugarcane mill, sugarcane workers and the Adelante Initiative coordinators like the La Isla Foundation. The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals/responses received from the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Any proposal/response should be emailed to Dwight Favors, Contract Specialist at dyf3@cdc.gov by June 18, 2018. If no affirmative responses are received on or before the date stated, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), negotiations will be conducted with the La Isla Foundation (LIF), P.O. Box 816, Ada, MI, 49301, as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>

<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than June 18, 2018 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Silterra, Inc. for the fabrication of up to 20 wafers with customized CMOS circuitry via a tape-out from a semiconductor foundry for the Center for Nanoscale Technology Science and Technology (CNST) Electron Physics Group. The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.
<p>The Electron Physics Group in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires the purchase of customized CMOS wafers based on flexible tape-out runs for a wafer-scale 0.18um CMOS chip fabrication process. The CMOS wafers received would be used as a first step in developing a measurement and application testbed for novel electronic devices that are currently being manufactured at the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST). Such an integrated measurement and application testbed will be used for parasitic-free novel device characterization as well as non-invasive imaging of complex circuits and systems as a part of CNST's mission to develop nanoscale measurement and characterization capabilities in support of users in the user facility.</p>
<p>Currently measurement and characterization of nanoscale resistive switches are limited by the parasitics and noise constraints of the measurement system that prevent accurate programming and evaluation of resistive states. Moreover, observation of information flow throughout complex hybrid CMOS+resistive switch based systems would require a large amount of flexibility, such as massive amount of invasive test points for current and voltage measurement that would deteriorate the performance of such a system. Monolithically integrating the measurements with customized CMOS wafers would eliminate both issues, as devices would suffer from much lower parasitics and direct imaging of information flow through non-invasive thermo-reflectance measurements would be possible.</p>
<p>NIST has an ongoing Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) to collaboratively design and fabricate resistive switching neuromorphic circuits based on wafer-scale CMOS chip tape-outs. The tape-outs required for this procurement will be used in this collaboration and the agreement commits NIST to provide some space on the wafers to the UCSB to design their own circuits.</p>
<p>Our collaborators at the UCSB have been designing CMOS chips using Silterra's proprietary processes. Therefore, to continue using their existing circuit designs, Silterra is uniquely qualified, as NIST and UCSB require the process in the new tapes-outs to be 100% compatible with Silterra's proprietary processes and only Silterra can comply with NIST's obligations under the existing CRADA with UCSB.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and shall occur not later than 120 days after design acceptance.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334413, and the size standard is 1250 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by established due date/time set forth in this notice. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joni.laster@nist.gov . No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Silterra, Inc. for foundry fabrication services for photonic micromechanical devices for the Center for Nanoscale Technology Science and Technology (CNST) Electron Physics Group. The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) enables science and industry by providing essential measurement methods, instrumentation, and standards to support all phases of nanotechnology development, from discovery to production. This procurement is necessary to develop new measurement methods and create facilities for collaborative research within the CNST.</p>
<p>Silterra is uniquely qualified to provide the required foundry fabrication services as no other supplier can develop a custom microfabrication process and microfabricate devices to NIST designs and specifications in small batches. The specifications combine doing accurate optical photolithographic patterning and etching of photonic-quality SOI silicon structures with sub 150 nm features on 200mm diameter wafers, followed by custom deposition and patterning of material layers of NIST-specified materials and thicknesses. NIST requires full-wafer fabrication of fully-custom devices in small-volumes for research purposes. Other services considered either lack the 193-nm optical lithography patterning capability required for this work, or are not providing fully-custom process development and device processing in small batches.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and shall occur not later than 9 months from date of award.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333242, and the size standard is 1500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by established due date/time set forth in this notice. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joni.laster@nist.gov .

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Brand Name and Sole Source
<p>Lynne D. Reed<br />US Army Corps of Engineers <br />1616 Capitol Ave Omaha, NE 68102</p>
<p>Product/Service Code: Z2PZ</p>
<p>Subject: Notice of Intent to Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements Per FAR 6.302-1</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: W9128F17R0017</p>
<p>Closing response date: 19 June 2018</p>
<p>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.203(a) -Publicizing and Response Time</p>
<p>US Army Corps of Engineers - Omaha District, intends to issue a Firm-Fixed Price contract to Emagineered Solutions; 527 NW Elm Ave, Box 3-405, Redmond, OR 97756 on a Sole Source basis.</p>
<p>Authority-<br />The authority for this brand name acquisition is FAR 6.302-1. Soliciting from a Single Source (including brand name) in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1901.<br />U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District intends issue a solicitation for a brand name, firm-fixed-price supply contract for the procurement of CYLutions. The purpose of this acquisition is to repair the waterstop leakage on the generator bay floors within the Gavins Point Project Office Powerhouse in Nebraska.<br />This notice of intent is issued under Per FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements</p>
<p>A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE POSTED. The Government intends to proceed with this sole source action. The NAICS code is 237990, "Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction" The size standard as defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration is $35,500,000.<br />Description of work- <br />The waterstop leakage has resulted in water ponding on generator bay floors within the powerhouse.  This leakage creates slip fall hazards in several areas where personnel work in the powerhouse.  Government forces have made efforts to contain the leakage as much as possible to limit the hazards. Due to the nature and extent of the leakage, there are hazards to government employees standing in water while working on and around high voltage electrical equipment with up to 13,800 volts.  Due to the life safety hazards associated with working on electrical equipment in wet conditions, this could be potentially a dangerous situation should water reach an energized power source while work is been performed. Work being performed is de-energized as much as possible during maintenance, but due to the nature of the water leakage through the joints it is hard to control the flow to the drainage system.</p>
<p>The work shall consist of drilling and installing two new vertical remedial waterstops in the upstream wall of the powerhouse at Gavins Point Dam, South Dakota. Waterstop material must be of the resilient type, having the ability to continuously contract and expand from season to season, year to year without failure of the waterstop material. Past-experience has shown that two part chemical epoxy and oxygen-expanding foams do not possess these qualities and fail within the first two years of installation. Rubber sock liners with antifreeze fluid are averaging about 5 years of useful life. The only remedial waterstop system with an extended historical performance record is the water-expanding urethane cylinder system.</p>
<p>There are three additional options that could be exercised if funding is available.  Each option consists of drilling and installing a urethane cylinder in a monolith joint similar to the work involved in the two joints in the basic portion of the contract.  The order of priority for the four joints included in the total contract will be determined during the engineering design phase of the project.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS. Interested concerns must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this requirement would be advantageous to the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quote to the contracting officer before the notice end date. If no affirmative written responses are received by 12:00 AM Central Daylight Time on 19 June 2018, a solicitation will be made without further notice. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Electronic responses and question shall be submitted via email to lynne.d.reed@usace.army.mil. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is not responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.</p>
