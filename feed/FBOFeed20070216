<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Spokane Research Laboratory has a requirement for a Geode 48-channel continuous recording system, with optional configuration as two 24-channel systems.  

IDENTIFICATION OF REQUIREMENT:

A rugged portable multi-channel exploration seismograph system is required for mine safety research projects conducted in NIOSH/SRL.  One noteworthy application is the detection and location of seismic signals produced by a trapped miner tapping on a mine roof.  The system must be rapidly deployable and modular in design to facilitate distributed deployments.  A minimum of 48 channels are required with the ability to expand to include additional channels.  Individual modules must be capable of operating as self-contained units with GPS time synchronization and as part of a larger integrated synchronized network.  The maximum channel count of individual modules shall be 24 channels with a minimum channel count of 8.  Minimum nominal digitizer resolution shall be 24-bit.  User-selectable sampling rates shall include options extending from 0.125 to 4 milliseconds with specific options for 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 milliseconds.

Internal preamplifier gains must be software selectable with one of the choices equal to 36 dB or 40 dB.  Noise floor of the system must be low enough that natural background vibrations at low-noise continental US (USGS reference model) sites can easily be resolved over the bandwidth 5 ? 500 Hz with suitable conventional geophones and ordinary deployment practices.

Conventional exploration seismograph features such as software to facilitate setup of distributed geophone arrays and conduct of refraction measurements, filtering, stacking, and plotting shall be provided.

The system must be capable of continuous recording of 48 waveform channels sampled at 2000 Hz with data written to disk in contiguous, non-overlapping, gapless, one-minute long files in SEG-Y or SEG-2 format.  Continuous unfiltered display of all 48 channels shall be possible in real-time with option of viewing low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and/or notch filtered continuous real-time waveform data. 

System must be capable, with appropriate software, of self-triggering or ?event triggering? of all modules using threshold or STA/LTA style triggering.

Software must include in-field refraction processing capability and automatic phase picking.

Conventional exploration?style geophones must be digital-grade 14-Hz with land cases, spike mounts, weather-resistant connectors and 1.5 m leader lengths.  Spread cables equipped with matching weather-resistant connectors should contain 24 takeouts spaced at 40-foot intervals.  Spread cables with end connectors must be segmented into ~480-ft lengths and fit onto supplied portable hand-crank cable reels.

Module housing must be rugged, suitable for portable deployment (no more than 10 lbs per module) and weatherproof.  Units must have 12-VDC low-power consumption and be completely compatibility with standard laptop computers running Windows 2000/XP.

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to:  Margaret L. Mooney, Reference 000HCCFB-2007-40434, CDC, NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA  15236,  MMooney@cdc.gov.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract.  Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.

The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide the requirement.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Geometrics, Inc, San Jose, CA as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.  The primary reason for selecting this entity is to provide the Geode 48-channel continuous recording system.  The Geode system can write continuous, sequential, one-minute long, 48-channel, 2000 samples per second data files to hard disk.  It can synchronize the recorded time bases to UTC time via GPS receivers. It can operate in event-trigger mode.  It provides a continuous real-time display of all channels with user-selectable filtering options.  (http://www.geometrics.com/seismographs/Geode/geode.html )

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Directorate of Procurement intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with DRS Unmanned Technologies, Inc., 6300 Columbia Street, Mineral Wells, TX 76067 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1.  The purpose of this procurement action will be for CLS to maintain the Neptune II systems to be delivered in 2007 and for the procurement of additional VCUAS capability.  After evaluation of the responses received to the RFI issued 05 Oct 06, USSOCOM has determined that no other supplier can provide the Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for existing Neptune II Unmanned Aircraft Systems or can design, develop, test, and manufacture Vehicle Craft Unmanned Aircraft System (VCUAS) systems within the timeframe called out in RFI to satisfy USSOCOM requirements.  Moreover, no other supplier responding to the RFI identified a system capable of operating and landing in the saltwater environment.  Based on results of the RFI and USSOCOM knowledge of the UAS market place, DRS UT, Inc is the only firm with the existing logistic support and manufacturing capability that is mature enough to meet VCUAS requirements within the established timeframe.  DRS maintains proprietary ownership of the engineering and maintenance technical order data rights to Neptune II.   Given the level of technology readiness of other contractors, the Government would be required to spend significant resources and considerable time for other suppliers to reach comparable support and manufacturing levels.  The DRS Neptune II is the only system available to meet the VCUAS requirement for operating in a maritime environment from small platforms.   The Government anticipates awarding one contract related to this announcement for a period of approximately five years with a potential maximum of up to $50,000,000.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency?see Note 22.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Ms. Kim DeBois-Sousa, Contracting Officer, Phone (813) 826-7077, Fax (813) 826-7504, Email Deboisk@socom.mil

<CONTACT>Brenda Wishart  Contracting Officer  3039876747     Brenda_Wishart@nps.gov ;
<DESC>"	General:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, is soliciting proposals for construction firms having the capability to perform the work described below. This solicitation will be issued electronically, on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov   Paper copies of this solicitation will not be made available. Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the National Business Center. Proposal documents will be available in Microsoft Word, HTML and Adobe PDF, Specifications will be available in Adobe PDF format, and drawings will be available in TIFF format. Offerors wishing to receive electronic notification of changes will need to register to receive notification of this specific solicitation at http://ideasec.nbc.gov. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the http://ideasec.nbc.gov site for all information relevant to this solicitation.  Plan holders will be required to visit this website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents. No other notifications will be sent. "	Proposed Issue Date:  March 6, 2007 "	Title of Project:  Provide Universal Accessibility for Ford's Theatre NHS "	Description: This project improves the four attached structures that now comprise Ford's Theatre National Historic Site; Ford's Theatre, the 517 Building, the Back L (or North Annex), and the Star Saloon.  The project also incorporates a new lobby and other facilities for the Theatre in an adjacent portion of the new Atlantic Building.  Work Includes: Demolition work: A nearly complete demolition of the 517 Building (only some of the foundation and some exterior walls are to remain and be incorporated into the reconstruction of the building); Selective demolition within Ford's Theatre, the Back L, and the Star Saloon, including building systems (to be upgraded), structural elements, finishes, roofing, and other miscellaneous items.  New work: a basically new 517 Building (structure, building systems, finishes, etc.); Accessibility improvements to all other structures of the complex; New elevator; Building code upgrades; Roofing systems; Architectural finishes; Historic preservation work (limited); Theatre amenities improvements; Building systems work that includes HVAC, plumbing, fire protection, electrical, and theatre system upgrades; And other miscellaneous work.   Work of the project will occur from approximately May, 2007 thru August, 2008 (15-16 months) during two Theatre Dark Periods and one Theatre Active Period.  The contractor must schedule and perform the majority of its work during the two Theatre Dark Periods.  This condenses actual construction work into the periods May thru October 29, 2007 and May 1 thru August, 2008, and means most of the work must be accomplished in only nine to ten months.  In addition, the work must be substantially complete in time for a Presidential Gala which is scheduled for the theatre in September, 2008.  No time extensions will be granted for excusable delays encountered on the project. Should the contractor encounter excusable impacts to its schedule, it will be required to regain the schedule through acceleration.  These time constraints will require a contractor with the capability to perform an average of approximately $1 million of work per month. The Contractor shall at all times conduct his operations to ensure the least inconvenience to the public, FTS, and the NPS staff.  Work of this contract requires varying levels of demolition, repair, and new work to existing building systems.  Such work shall be planned and performed to allow protection for the public, NPS and FTS staff, and Ford's Theatre NHS.  Protection shall include operating the building systems as required by the contract. All work shall be performed under a single contract to the National Park Service Contracting Officer.  Note that the NPS and FTS shall have other work, not a part of this contract, performed by others during periods of Use and Possession. Such work will be typically installation of specialty items.  Contractor shall coordinate the work of this contract with the work of other others as required.  LOCATION: Ford's Theatre National Historic Site (NHS), 511-517 10th Street NW, Washington, D.C.  For the purposes of the contract documents, Ford's Theatre NHS includes the Ford's Theatre building, the 517 Building, the Back L (or North Annex), the Star Saloon (511 10th Street) and (a portion of) the Atlantic Building and does not include the Peterson House (the house where Lincoln died) at 516 10th Street NW, Washington, D.C.  There is no work or access to the Peterson House in this contract.  "	Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price. "	Estimated price range, $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 "	Time for completion; non-negotiable completion date August 31, 2008 "	Solicitation Issue and Proposal receipt dates are approximate; actual dates will be established at the time solicitation documents are available and issued. "	All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.

The Navy has experienced problems in using alternate devices from various manufacturers; media manufactured by other sources may be incompatible, resulting in slow mounting of the disk or inability to read the optical disk.  These failures have been random and inconsistent but are not acceptable; therefore, alternate sources are not desired.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GFSC) has a requirement to continue Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of the Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) facility owned by West Virginia University Research Corporation (WVURC) and located in Fairmont, WV.  NASA GSFC intends to increase the current contract value under Contract NAS5-03126 until a follow-on contract is awarded.  This increase in contract value is required to ensure uninterrupted support.	When NASA established the O&M requirements and the associated value of the O&M contract in 2003, NASA was not fully utilizing the majority of the first floor of the IV&V Facility which consists of high quality raised floor computer space.  However, in 2004, NASA leased portions of the raised floor computer space to NOAA to house NOAA super computers and other systems.  To accommodate NOAA’s systems, significant facility infrastructure enhances had to be made.  Per established agreements between NOAA, NASA and WVURC, all facility infrastructure enhancements were accommodated under this O&M contract using NOAA funding passed through NASA to WVURC.  Therefore, the value of the contract needs to be increased to allow for these unexpected and unplanned for expenses. WVRUC will continue to support; data center environment maintenance services, general facility operation and maintenance services, communication services, furniture and general office furnishings services, occupant services, library services, mail room operations, handyperson services, security services, vending machine services, document photocopy services, planning and coordination services, general office supply services, ADP services, training services, and network operations and maintenance services. This procurement action is being conducted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304( c)(1) Only one Responsible Source.  NASA and the West Virginia University Research Corporation (WVURC) in the early 1990s partnered to build the NASA IV&V Facility in Fairmont, West Virginia.  By Public Law 102-139 – October 28, 1991, NASA provided funding to WVURC to build the building.  After construction, a Memorandum of Understanding was established between NASA and the West Virginia University agreeing that WVURC would provide the building to NASA for NASA’s use but would be “responsible for the development and daily operation of the facility.”  Follow on agreements were established (cooperative agreements and contracts) between NASA and WVURC to continue to provide operation and maintenance (O&M) services to the facility for NASA.  The grant stipulated that NASA would occupy the facility to perform IV&V services for the Agency.   In support of this activity, NASA awarded a contract to WVURC for the operation and maintenance of the facility in support of the NASA activities since the original occupation of the building in 1993. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of specialized services, such services may be deemed to be available from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to recovered though competition.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 5, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The Nanomanufacturing Strategic Program within the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL) supports industrial commercialization of nanotechnology through the development of nanoscience and nanometrology. 

This program resides within the Precision Engineering Division and has moved into new territories, which include work on biological and non-biological nano-particles. 
    
There is a Competence Project currently running, which is titled: "Metrology for the "Fate" of Nanoparticles in Biosystems".  The work in this project calls for sample
preparation for imaging and dimensional measurements of biological samples for investigations at the nano-scale. 

Certain samples, especially biological ones, cannot be imaged or measured unless they are kept frozen during sample preparation and investigation in other types of scientific instrumentation. 

The new, unique technology called helium ion microscopy which has recently been introduced by ALIS/Carl Zeiss Corporation, 
will facilitate this program in its mission and in the support of nanomanufacturing.  

Only ALIS/Carl Zeiss can provide this equipment.  The HIM has been developed and manufactured by ALIS/Carl Zeiss.  ALIS/Carl Zeiss  has proprietary rights to the helium ion microscopy technology and is the sole distributor of this microscope.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by February 23, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Bureau of Engraving & Printing (BEP) is seeking a tamper evident flexible film that shall meet the performance requirements of the BEP?s Specification F: SW-5 dated March 19, 2003 for packaging cash-paks of currency notes with the following additional two requirements: For Section 3.3.8 (?Tamper Evidence?), in addition to the stated text, the film shall show highly visible evidence when punctured, breached or otherwise tampered with. For Section 3.4.4 (?Thickness?), the film shall be significantly thinner (0.002-0.005 inches ideally) than the current film in use with no loss of specified performance properties or end-use functionality, particularly with no loss in strength properties.    Interested parties who want to participate in this effort shall submit a technical description and technical data sheet of their film along with a sample for BEP review.  The BEP will work with the vendor in a collaborative effort to determine if the film meets the BEP?s requirements through practical trials of the film on BEP equipment as warranted.   The technical description and sample (approximately 3 square feet) should be sent to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Attn: Office of Materials Technology, Dr. John F. Bobalek, Room 201-29A, 14th & C Sts., S.W., Washington, D.C.  20228.

Description
CASS Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Request for Comment.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR COMMENT.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  NAVAIR Lakehurst is seeking potential sources and industry comments / feedback for the potential acquisition of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) services to include maintenance and support services necessary to ensure system component availability and/or system performance of Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) stations, which includes the High Power Device Test Subsystem (HPDTS).  This acquisition also shall include PBL services for the CASS system Electro Optics (EO3).  These systems and components are located in the Fleet as well as land based sites in CONUS (Continental US) and OCONUS (Outside Continental US) locations.  The Navy intends to procure these support services on an FFP basis.  The proposed single solicitation vehicle would also allow the PBL services for the CASS system and the EO3 system to be awarded on separate IDIQ contracts.  This also allows each to be potentially awarded to separate contractors or all to one contractor.  Therefore, any potential awardee may bid on the support for both systems or on one system as listed separately on each CLIN.  The period of performance for each system's base award shall be five years, with five one-year option periods, potentially totaling ten years for the entire contract performance. 
  
All attachments enclosed are based on the government's currently available data and are subject to change prior to the solicitation being released and prior to award.  Attached is a notional Schedule B that includes the CLINs and pricing structure.

The attachments included are listed as follows:

Attachment 2	  	CASS Item Support List 				11 Pages

<DESC>NASA, Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is requesting industry to provide questions and comments on the work control approach described below.	The questions/comments received as a result of this Request for Information (RFI) will be considered when formulating the final Request for Proposals (RFPs) for the future KSC institutional contracts, so industry input is highly encouraged.  This approach would not replace all or preclude the use of other mandatory information management systems specified in any solicitation. The Government is considering providing a single Maximo Asset and Service Management System for use by the future KSC institutional contractors to schedule/manage work, manage Government-owned assets, and document maintenance on assets through their life cycle. Contractors will be expected to utilize the system to, among other things, coordinate work with each other to ensure a seamless work environment, facilitate communication with customers, compile and organize maintenance history, and provide government access to all data on a routine basis.  The Government anticipates that use of this government provided system will result in the reduction of the number and types of hardware and software on the Center, reduce the duplication of skills, improve IT security, and facilitate HSPD-12 compliance. The Contractor’s work management data, such as work order tracking, intrinsic facility/system information, work description, crew requirements/assignments, schedule requirements/info and historic data would reside in a single database. However, data would be segregated into contract-specific areas and through access permissions, these data would be protected from unauthorized access. Each contractor’s area would be designed/tailored to their specific workflows, reports, and screen views. The Government intends to have the proposed system operational for the user contract transition periods.  At RFP release, the Government intends to provide a snapshot of the legacy data identified. It is the Government’s intention to ensure that each contractor’s workflow processes remain isolated from other contractors view.	 To date, has not been decided if the Government approach would have a separate contractor operate, maintain, and sustain the Maximo hardware and software, or if it would be a requirement in the Information Management and Communications Support Contract.	The Government will establish defined service level agreements with the Maximo provider to ensure the availability of the system. Specifically, the Government would like comments on: •What issues or concerns industry has with the Government furnishing the work control / asset management system? •What issues or concerns industry has with data residing on shared resources? •What issues or concerns industry has with Maximo operations, maintenance, and sustaining service being provided by a company other than their own? •What Maximo enterprise extensions would be most useful for the Government to provide? •How much time does the Government need to provide the Contractor for workflow, report, and screen design prior to full contract performance start? •What information relative to Maximo implementation would industry like to see in the bidder’s library? •Please provide any other thoughts on this issue. DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information and Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response to this request.  All information contained in this RFI is preliminary as well as subject to modification and is in no way binding on the Government.  The requested responses are for information and planning purposes only.  There will not be a formal posting of answers/responses to these questions and comments, but any changes they drive will appear in the draft RFPs.   NASA KSC does not intend to acknowlede receipt of comments, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.  If the Government feels there is a need to discuss certain comments that are submitted, the Government may contact some or all respondents concerning those comments.  NASA KSC may release any and all data received in response to the RFI and reserves the right to release this information to all interested parties if the need arises.	Data/information with limited or restricted rights is not solicited.  The Government requests that you submit your comments by March 2, 2007.	Advance notification of intent to submit a response to this RFI is requested via email by February 23, 2007 to Sean D. Howe, Contracting Officer. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in the FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS).  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) For Army Training and Doctrine Development Configuration/Training and Doctrine Development Tool (TDDC/TDDT) 11 August 2006 Version 0.6
Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is soliciting information on ways to provide the Army with a Training Development Tool utilizing an existing database consisting of tasks and training support plans developed by individual Army service schools.  The Army requires the ability to conduct analysis, design, and development of Army training products that are deposited into a centralized database. The centralized database of training products is available for discovery and delivery to users anywhere in the world. The training products developed support all levels of Army training and the three domains of Army training (Unit, Institutional and Self-development).
PEO STRI would also like information on how this provided capability would be maintained and fit within the Armys overall Training Information Architecture.

HISTORY:  The US Army develops, maintains and delivers training and Army doctrine to soldiers, teams and units deployed world-wide.  Training information includes courses, lessons, individual Soldier Training Plans, Combined Arms Training Strategies, and more.  Development of these products is based on tasks, which allow for the sharing of information between different products as appropriate and required.

The US Army Training Support Center (ATSC) developed a contract which was awarded to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in April 1999, to produce an integrated solution for Army training and doctrine development, storage and delivery based  on the Army Training Information Architecture Operational Architecture.  This contract delivered a list of Army training and doctrine requirements, an Army Training Information Architecture (ATIA), and integrated information systems (Army Training Information Architecture, Migrated, ATIA-M).  The ATIA-M is largely a series of web-based Java applications using an Oracle database.  The Training Doctrine Development Tool (TDDT), was developed in the NET framework to provide training and doctrine developers a standalone product development and maintenance capability.  The TDDT interacts with the server-based ATIA-M Training and Doctrine Development Configuration (TDDC) for information storage, discovery and sharing/reuse.

An  Oracle database, known as the Digital Library Data Repository (DLDR), was established to host the combination of about 26 individual Army service school training products.  The DLDR provides the ATIA-M common information source.  ATIA-M applications use the combined database for content development (TDDC/TDDT), storage (Digital Library Data Repository), discovery and delivery (Individual Training Configuration, ITC).  Training and doctrine developers currently use a combination of the Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT) that is connected with an individual Army service school database (Sybase) and MS Word which is used to periodically populate the DLDR.

TDDT and TDDC fail to meet requirements.  Functional testing of the TDDT application conducted in the spring of 2006 identified significant areas of needed functional improvement.  Subsequent performance testing of the TDDC also identified areas of needed performance improvement.  A copy of the functional testing after action report is provided at enclosure 6, copies of enhancement and change requests submitted as a result of functional testing are provided at enclosure 5.  A copy of the 14 July 2006 TDDC performance evaluation report is provided as enclosure 1.

As a point of reference, the Training and Doctrine Development Configuration Assessment for TRADOC, dated 14 July 2006, asserts that the underlying Enterprise Java Bean (EJB)-centric design is overly complex for the system requirements.  Generally, there are four conditions where use of EJB may be appropriate, and the requirements allocated to the Training and Doctrine Development Configuration fit none of these conditions.  Accordingly, it is prudent to consider other solutions, which may apply a more efficient design in terms of system performance, interoperability requirements notwithstanding.  The report also indicates potential issues with database design in terms of tables and indexes and usability in terms of work flow.

TDDT and TDDC have had limited collective task training development supporting Future Combat System (FCS) training in the past two (2) years.  Interfaces with other Army training information systems for retrieval of essential information are being developed with the ATIA-M data repository, to include: the Digital Training Management System (DTMS) for unit training management; and the Army Learning Management System (ALMS) for individual training management.  A copy of the ATIA-M/ALMS interface requirements specification is provided for reference at enclosure 7.  Future interfaces with the Training and Doctrine Development Management System (TD2) and Course Level Training Model (CLTM) are envisioned to support Department of the Army costing and resourcing requirements.  Other interfaces with doctrine repositories, the Army Training Requirements Reservation System (ATRRS), and more, are anticipated to be required.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this RFI is: to obtain information; assess industry capabilities; solicit industry comments/recommendations in order to provide a functionally and technically satisfactory Army training design and development capability; and to make a recommendation to the Army for an appropriate solution that considers suitability of the current solution, considers emerging technologies, information system interfaces and existing data repositories.  We anticipate three broad potential courses of action: fix current implementation; develop a hybrid solution of current implementation and new technology; and a new/replacement solution.  The proposed solution should address the following as a minimum:

·	Describe how the proposed solution is consistent with the current ATIA-M, and how it differs from the current ATIA-M TDDT/TDDC implementation; provide advantages and disadvantages of your solution.
·	Evaluate the ability of the proposed solution to integrate with the ATIA-M, based upon a minimum of level 1 interoperability as described in paragraph 5.1 of enclosure 2
·	Achieve business processes and provide capability to allow users to develop and render individual and collective training products as data objects, as outlined in the ATIA Use Case documentation provided at enclosure 3.
·	Training development requirements, and system performance requirements, provided at enclosure 4.
·	An agile software development methodology that accommodates changing requirements; providing iterative development and testing in advance of final testing, that should include performance load testing.
·	Implement a high-performing framework that is user friendly and functionally acceptable, and interacts with the established database of electronic Army training and doctrine products comprised of finished/published publications and task-based data objects that may be shared.
·	Single sign on capabilities using the Army Knowledge Online (AKO) for user authentication.
·	The capability for continuity of training developer workflow, regardless of network connectivity, without reliance on branch specific, or multiple standalone databases.
·	Migration of Service school data into the ATIA-M centralized database in a way that avoids unwanted data duplication.
·	Performance and functional testing of the proposed solution to ensure the optimal solution is available to the Government, and the proposed solution satisfies functional and performance requirements.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  Interested parties are requested to review the ATIA interoperability documentation, TDDC performance analysis, Change Request documentation and ATIA requirements.  Written responses are limited to 12 pages and should include a rough order of magnitude and projected schedule for work to be performed.  Specific review/input is requested in the following areas:

For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime Vendor program please access the web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil . The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month o ption periods.  The anticipated award date is June 2007.

For further questions, please call Ms. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 or email sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil prior to the closing date of this solicitation. Evaluation Criteria The evaluation criteria will be bas ed upon a combination of clinical and technical factors and pricing considerations.  Clinical and technical criteria are more important than pricing. The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.

The CPT, comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines, will evaluate Contrast Media products and recommend the preferred product based upon the  technical and clinical evaluation of the products. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical criteria.  The TRBO and CPT will review the responses and determine acceptability.   Technical Criteria Evaluation The TRBO and CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability: 1.

Clinical Criteria Evaluation Following acceptability of the technical criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request samples from the product group to be evaluated at selected MTFs.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committ ed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The CPT, comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines, will evaluate Contrast Media products and recommend the preferred product based upon clini cal evaluation of the products.  Clinical factors will be weighted more heavily than price, weighted equally on a Likert scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).  Minimum clinical acceptability is considered a total average score of 2 or above. 1.	Products have low adverse reaction potential 2.	Products provide optimal image quality, imaging enhancement pattern, and intravascular opacification (arterial, portal venous, systemic venous) 3.	Ease of use

<ARCHDATE>02162008
<CONTACT>Edward Tafoya Contracting Officer 3039692116     Edward_Tafoya@nps.gov    ;
<DESC>General:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior,  (NPS) intends to negotiate a sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, Design-Build Contract with the design team lead by Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. (WJE), Northbrook, Illinois to acquire the below listed services. Point of Contact:  Edward L. Tafoya, Contracting Officer (303) 969-2116 Title of Project: Temporary Stabilization and Waterproofing of the Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial. Description:  The work of this proposed contract action consists of supplemental investigation, analysis, stabilization, and temporary waterproofing of the Monument.   Additional monitoring and analysis will be required for long term protection and stabilization of the monument.  The project location is at Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial in Put-in-Bay, Ohio. The monument is a 352-foot column in the Doric order built of 78 courses of pink Milford, Massachusetts granite.   The monument's rotunda is of Indiana limestone, with a floor of Tennessee and Italian marble. It is surmounted by a 23-foot tall bronze urn. Plazas are of granite stones and a circular brick pattern at base of column with granite benches, urns, and planting boxes. Restrooms were added in 1971. The column itself is essentially unreinforced masonry constructed on bedrock. On June 22, 2006, a portion of a 500-pound granite fascia stone fell off the Observation Deck and crashed onto the Upper Plaza and penetrated the concrete slab into the basement below (no one was injured).  Both metal (urn) and column (granite) pieces have fallen off recently.  The monument was closed and WJE was contracted to perform an exterior condition assessment of the monument.  Interim measures taken included installing security fencing to limit access at the upper plaza. The design-build contractor will provide supplemental investigation, analysis, stabilization, and temporary waterproofing repairs at monument. The estimated amount of services will not exceed $5,000,000 over the life of the contract.   The term of the contract will be one base year with the option to extend the contract for an additional four years in one-year increments.  WJE's continuing involvement with this project is necessary to determine whether or not it is safe for the visiting public to use the monument.  Until it can be determined that it is safe to re-open, the monument should remain closed.  Therefore, the NPS must proceed immediately with the additional testing and investigation, analysis, stabilization and temporary waterproofing of the project.  Additional monitoring and analysis will be required to provide for long term protection and stabilization of Park visitors and the monument. If the temporary waterproofing repairs at the top portion of the monument are not made during the spring of 2007, water will continue to infiltrate the monument and accelerate the deterioration of the concrete structure.  The structural problems of the project can not be determined without the additional testing, investigation, and analysis.  Stabilization of the concrete parapet wall and weakest corner at the Observation Deck will have to be delayed.  If load testing on the Upper Plaza's structural concrete beams and slabs is not performed this spring, the NPS will not be able to tell if its structural system needs to be replaced.  The NPS has already placed loading restrictions on the stairs of the Lower Plaza due to weak concrete stringer beams holding up the stairs. Allowing the structure to remain untreated would increase risk of further material failures at the top of the structure, thus creating an extreme hazard to visitor and staff safety at the base of the column.  The monument would remain closed if this work is not performed. This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures of FAR 5.201 and 6.302.  The subsequent contract will be negotiated in accordance with FAR 36.606 and FAR Part 15.  The Government believes that the identified contractor is the best qualified source to lead the design build team in accordance with FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency for the required services.   Firms believing they can provide the required services must provide supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements via submission of a brief statement of qualifications to include listings and references for at least five similar projects that have been completed in the past five years.  All responses received within 30 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by FAX at (303) 987-6646, Attention:  Edward Tafoya.  Responses should include the statement of qualifications, listings and references of similar projects, the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number.  In order to be considered, the firm must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration system.

The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified industry sources for providing emergency preparedness equipment and support services for the United States Senate (Senate), Office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA).  The Office of Security and Emergency Preparedness (OSEP) within the SAA has a broad range of responsibilities that include providing emergency preparedness equipment for distribution throughout the U.S. Senate.  In the five years since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States Capitol Police (USCP) Board and the Senate Sergeant at Arms have greatly expanded the protection and preparedness of the Senate.  More than 17,000 ILC Dover SCape CBRN30 escape hoods, 500 Baby SCape CBRN30 escape hoods, 700 PB&R Essex Victim Rescue Unit Plus smoke hoods, 1,000 Motorola wireless emergency annunciators models IV and V, and 400 Emergency Supply Kits are part of the security and preparedness program.  

The SAA is currently conducting market research to determine the existence of viable organizations capable of providing the necessary services in support of its emergency preparedness operations. 

All requirements listed below are mandatory unless otherwise noted. This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Senate to an award of a contract.

<DESC>The 92nd Contracting Squadron is seeking potential sources interested in proposing on an acquisition for airfield painting and paint removal of airfield markings on Fairchild Air Force Bases runway, taxiways, and other flightline locations. The purpose of the Sources Sought notice is to identify the availability of qualified sources for a potential Hub Zone or 8(a) program set-aside. The anticipated contract type will be a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity type contract. The performance period will be one base year plus four-one year option periods. The program value is estimated at $800,000 over five (5) years. Work to be performed under the contract will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code as follows: 237310 - Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction. Small business size standard is $31 million.  Individual task orders are expected to range between $10,000 and $150,000.

The scope of this project is anticipated to include the removal of a projected 10,000 square feet of loose or flaking airfield pavement markings and complete removal and disposal of a projected 15,000 square feet of airfield pavement markings annually.

<DESC>The 355th Contracting Squadron is seeking potential sources interested in proposing on an acquisition for rubber and paint removal and application of new paint at Davis-Monthan AFB, located in Tucson Arizona.  The majority of work will be in the flight line area, but may include some work on base streets.  The purpose of the Sources Sought notice is to identify the availability of qualified sources for a potential Hub Zone or 8(a) program set-aside.  The anticipated contract will be a Firm Fixed Price with a magnitude between $250,000 and $500,000.  Work to be performed under the contract will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code as 237310 ? Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction.  Small business size standard is $31M.

The following tasks are anticipated:

1.  Remove aircraft rubber tire deposits from the surface of the concrete portion of the runway by using water-blasting (hydra-blasting).  Remove 90% of the visible rubber deposits by applying a minimum of 30,000 psi water pressure supplied by a rig manufactured for that purpose.  Vacuuming of the residue from the water-blasting will be required by a motorized vacuum truck.  Vacuumed liquid will be transported to and dumped at a treatment plant located in a different area of the base.  Rubber deposits remaining in the vacuumed material will be dumped off base as rubbish.  Machinery used will ensure the capability of accomplishing all runway rubber removal (approximately 300,000 square feet) in 24 hours total work.  Machinery/crews must be capable of accomplishing the work at night.

2.  Remove existing painted striping on airfield concrete paving by water-blasting (hydra-blasting).  Remove 95% of the existing paint stripes by applying a 30,000 to 50,000 psi water pressure supplied by a rig manufactured for that purpose.  Hydra-blaster will be capable of generating 50,000 psi of water pressure.  Vacuuming, transporting, and disposing the residue of the paint removal will be treated the same as in (1) above.

3.  Paint striping not removable by water-blasting via the method in (2) above, will be removed using a mechanized grinder.  Grinder will be capable of removing hardened paint while not damaging the concrete below the paint.  Clean-up of grinding residue will be as in (1) above.  Note: Much of the paint to be removed may be very thick!  Some areas have received annual re-striping for 20 years; thus extreme build-up requiring excessively slow and difficult removal processes.  Some of the paint build-up is ?? in thickness.

4.  Apply new paint striping to the airfield.  Machinery used will ensure capability of applying all runway striping (approximately 100,000 square feet) in a maximum of two eight-hour periods.  This ensures the runway can be painted in daylight hours on a typical weekend.  Paint colors to be applied on the entire airfield may include yellow, white, black, and red.  Most painted areas require the mechanical application of Type I beads for reflectivity.

5.  Apply new paint striping on the base streets/roads.  Machinery will have an air nozzle to blow away debris immediately in front of the paint applicator.  Fresh paint will be protected from traffic until dry.  Street striping may include some crosswalks and traffic arrows.  No parking lots will be included.

6.  It is desirable that all rubber removal, paint removal, and street/road striping be accomplished in the contract in a 15 day period.  It is customary for the Base to schedule this contract around a three-day (holiday) weekend to capitalize on a convenient runway closure period.  It is paramount for contractors to adhere to the prescribed schedule.  A lot of sequential day/night operations will need to be conducted requiring multiple crews on the project.  Contractor will be responsible for furnishing the proper amounts of paint and delivering to and receiving at the job site.  Contractor will dispose of empty paint drums/buckets off-base.

7.  Project plans showing areas of work with associated paint quantities required will be furnished by Base CE to the contractor.  Contractor will have a means of computing/recording applied paint quantities and rubber/paint removals.  Contractor and government inspector will review/concur on completed quantities on a daily basis.

If you have the capability and are interested in this acquisition, submit a detailed capability statement and evidence of past performance of this type of work in the past three years.  In addition, provide a point of contact with phone and e-mail information, business status (socio-economic factors), business size based on NAICS 237310, and a positive statement of interest to submit a proposal.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information for the purposes of conducting market research and to identify qualified entities to operate the Federal Judiciary Bankruptcy Noticing Center program.  This RFI is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the BNC program needs. This RFI does not constitute a future contract and vendors shall not be compensated for providing information. A  Request for Proposals will follow in the near future.

The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has identified a performance based requirement for services and support for the production and transmission of notices for the United States Bankruptcy Courts. The services provided by the BNC program include, but are not limited to, receiving bankruptcy case related data in electronic format, producing bankruptcy notices, distributing notices through the United States Postal Service or by electronic transmission, in the most cost efficient, timely and effective manner, and providing program related reports to the AO and Bankruptcy Courts.

The process of producing and preparing notices for transmission is done by the Bankruptcy Court staff and other entities, such as contractors, debtors, attorneys and trustees. Under a contract managed by the AO, the BNC electronically retrieves data from participating courts case management systems and automates the printing, addressing, batching, and mailing process. The BNC is able to generate notices at a fraction of the time and cost that would be required if produced by local courts. Since its inception in 1993, the BNC program has saved the Judiciary over $67 million in noticing costs and has improved service to the Bankruptcy Courts and notice recipients. Currently, the Government has a contract for operating a BNC through September 2008. A solicitation and resulting contract award will replace the existing contract for the BNC.

Detailed information is provided in the draft PWS. A link to the document appears below.  Please note that all Section J attachment will be provided upon issuance of the Request for Proposals.

Vendor information should be submitted which provides high level information about the company, including years in business, experience providing capabilities outlined in the draft PWS, and other information deemed relevant.  Links to a website or marketing materials are acceptable as long as the information is easy to discern from other materials submitted.

Responses shall be limited to a total of 25 pages and must be completed in Microsoft Word, WordPerfect or Adobe PDF format.  

We will not divulge individual responses to the RFI outside of the Judiciary BNC evaluation team. 

Time and Date of Submittal:

Information submitted in response to this Request for Information should be submitted electronically no later than March 16, 2007.  All submittals shall be addressed to Michelle_Hupp@ao.uscourts.gov

Questions:

Questions regarding this Request for Information will be accepted in writing ONLY. No telephonic questions will be accepted.    Questions should be addressed to Michelle_Hupp@ao.uscourts.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking to determine if the International Social Security Association (ISSA) is the only source capable of meeting researching and writing, in collaboration with SSA, the document Social Security Programs Throughout the World (SSPTW) or if other sources can provide these services to SSA.  Specifically, SSA is attempting to determine if another source can update the information for the social security programs in 172 countries in each of the 4 regional volumes of SSPTW, produced at 6-month intervals. This may require translating the survey into French, Spanish or German; conducting additional research where needed; and, contacting other social security-related organizations in a particular country. This requires surveying the social security institutions in each country for changes in their programs since the 2006/2007 edition and working in conjunction with SSA?s Office of Policy (OP).

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center is seeking sources to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the applicable electric, water, and wastewater distribution systems at Defense Distribution Depot Susquehanna Pennsylvania (DDSP).  The Installation is an 848-acre logistics facility located in York County, Fairview Township, just to the east of New Cumberland, Pennsylvania.  DDSP contains approximately 175 buildings (including 140 military family housing units), totaling approximately 6,105,000 square feet.  The Installation is operated by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) under permit from the Army Material Command (AMC).  Its primary mission is to receive, store, and ship supplies to the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines.

Electrical: Pennsylvania Power and Light (PP&L) provides power to DDSP by a single 68-kV circuit capable of delivering approximately 40 megawatts to the Government-owned main substation.  From the main substation, power is distributed throughout the Installation on three distribution circuits at primarily one voltage level, 12.47/7.2 kV.  The distribution circuits are three-phase, four-wire lines rated at 15 kV; approximately 38,343 linear circuit feet are overhead and 18,596 linear circuit feet are underground.  Construction dates for the underground and overhead circuits range from the late 1960s to the 1990s.  The majority of the equipment located in the main substation was installed in the 1960s and 1990s as well.  The overall system appears to be in good condition.
  
Water: The Pennsylvania American Water Company, with its own treatment and storage facility located one mile from the Installation, supplies potable water to DDSP.  The purchased water enters the Installation through two water mains; an eight-inch line in the northwest corner of the Installation and a 10-inch line in the southwest corner of the Installation.  The 10-inch line is normally valved to maintain the charge on a one-million-gallon, in-ground, covered concrete reservoir.  This reservoir supplies the potable water to the installation while also serving as a backup emergency fire demand system.  The distribution system piping totals approximately 95,900 linear feet including mains and service connections (86,322 linear feet were constructed in the mid-1990s).  Pipe sizes range from 4 to 20-inch in diameter and pipe includes cast iron, ductile iron, asbestos cement, and copper.
 
Sanitary Wastewater: Domestic wastewater generated at DDSP is treated on-site at the Installation's Smith & Loveless Model R "Oxigest" package treatment plant.  The plant uses activated sludge in the contact stabilization mode to provide secondary treatment.  The secondary effluent passes through an anthracite sand filter prior to disinfection with chlorine gas.  The final effluent is discharged to the Susquehanna River.  The wastewater collection piping totals approximately 42,886 linear feet, includes both gravity and pressure piping, and ranges in size from three to 12 inches in diameter.  Types of pipe include vitrified clay, terra cotta, lined vitrified clay, cast iron, and PVC.  Eleven exterior pump stations are used to convey flows to the wastewater treatment plant.  These stations are of the duplex submersible design and were installed in 1979.  Pump capacities range from 100 to 600 GPM.  Wastewater entering the headworks at the treatment plant is pumped to a 1.0 million gallon equalization tank installed in 1980 to handle excessive inflow and infiltration in the collection system.
 
The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  

Interested parties are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought including, commercial market information and company information. Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone number and e-mail address; business size and disadvantaged, 8(a) or HUBZone status; corporate affiliations; potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, and or major subcontractor or (prime).

Description
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the applicable electric, gas, water, and wastewater distribution systems at Defense Depot San Joaquin Sharpe (DDJC-S) and Defense Depot San Joaquin Tracy (DDJC-T).  


DDJC-Sharpe is a 1,185-acre logistics facility located in the town of Stockton in Central California's San Joaquin Valley, approximately 65 miles south of Sacramento.  The mission of DDJC-S is to receive, store, and ship Government-owned supplies and equipment, primarily to military customers in the western U.S. and the Pacific Theater of operations.  Supplies and equipment include clothing and textiles, food, medical supplies, construction materials, electrical supplies/components, sonabuoys, aircraft and vehicle tires, and a wide array of secondary repair parts.


DDJC-Tracy is a 450-acre logistics facility located in the town of Tracy in Central California's San Joaquin Valley, approximately 65 miles east of San Francisco.  The mission of DDJC-T is to receive, store, and ship Government-owned supplies and equipment, primarily to military customers in the western U.S. and the Pacific Theater of operations.  Supplies and equipment include clothing and textiles, food, medical supplies, construction materials, electrical supplies/components, sonabuoys, aircraft and vehicle tires, and a wide array of secondary repair parts.

 
DDJC-Sharpe Electrical: Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides power to DDJC-S via a single pole, three-phase, 60 kV transmission line that feeds the main substation located on the southeast portion of the Installation.  The primary distribution system voltage was recently converted from 4,160 volts to 12.47/7.2kV wye connected system.  From the main substation, four 12.47 kV feeder circuits form a series of service loops that provide power throughout the Installation.  The distribution system is comprised of a combination of above-ground and underground circuits.  Above-ground circuits consist of approximately 42,600 linear feet of 3-phase, 4/0 AWG primary lines; 11,800 linear feet of 3-phase, secondary lines; and 4,650 linear feet of single-phase lines.  Under-ground circuits consist of approximately 8,900 linear feet of three-phase, 2/0 AWG primary lines and 2,200 linear feet of three-phase, secondary lines.  Both the above-ground and under-ground lines were constructed in 1999.  The equipment located in the main substation was installed in the mid to late 1990s.  The overall system appears to be in good to excellent condition.

  
DDJC-Sharpe Gas:  Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides gas to DDJC-S via two meter/regulator stations.  At these stations, the gas is reduced from 30 to 5.5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig).  DDJC-S piping ranges from 2 to 6 inches in diameter.  Piping materials consist of approximately 11,770 linear feet of coated and wrapped steel, 10,210 linear feet of PE, 4,080 linear feet of industrial service black steel, and 480 linear feet of industrial service PE.  The majority of the piping was installed in the late 1980s to mid 1990s and is considered to be in good condition.  Approximately 8,600 linear feet of the piping was installed in 1968 and is considered to be in poor condition.  All valves are considered to be in average condition.    

DDJC-Sharpe Water:  The primary source of water for DDJC-S is four wells located on the Installation.  DDJC-S also has an interconnection with the City of Lathrop so they can draw water from the City's system if needed or so water can be transferred from DDJC-S to the City if needed.  Each well has a vertical turbine pump that pumps water directly to an arsenic treatment plant prior to entering a 1942 vintage (rehabbed in 1997), 500,000-gallon ground storage reservoir.  Water is chlorinated prior to and after the arsenic treatment.  The purpose of the ground reservoir is to supply water to the Installation and to provide chlorination contact time.  A 1942 vintage (rehabbed in 1992), 75,000-gallon elevated steel storage tank also exists to balance flows and to provide a more stable water pressure.  The distribution system piping totals approximately 87,200 linear feet including mains and service connections all of which is ductile iron installed in 1942 except for 3,200 linear feet which is PVC installed in 1991.  Pipe sizes range from 3 to 16 inches in diameter.
 
DDJC-Sharpe Wastewater: Domestic wastewater generated at DDJC-S is treated on-site.  The wastewater treatment plant was constructed in 1943 and renovated in 1996.  The plant provides secondary treatment and is a compact, cast-in-place concrete facility with a design capacity of 380,000 gallons per day.  The treatment process consists of a primary clarifier, primary trickling filter, secondary clarifier, secondary trickling filter, anaerobic digester, chlorination system and contact chamber, de-chlorination system, and sludge beds.  The effluent from the plant is discharged to an adjacent evaporation/percolation pond.  Existing plant flow rates range from 40,000 to 80,000 gallons per day.  The wastewater collection piping is 1942 vintage, totals approximately 30,780 linear feet, and ranges in size from 4 to 8 inches in diameter.  Seven pump stations are used to convey flows to the wastewater treatment plant via 5,170 linear feet of force main.  These stations are duplex stations with pump flows between 150 and 500 gallons per day.  Four lift stations were constructed in 1942, one in 1950, one in 1988, and one in 1998.
 

DDJC-Tracy Electrical: Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides power to DDJC-T via a single pole, three-phase, 60 kV transmission line that feeds the main substation located on the Installation.  The primary distribution system voltage was converted from 4,160 volts to 12.47/7.2 kV wye connected system.  From the main substation, three 12.47 kV feeder circuits provide power throughout the Installation.  The distribution system is comprised of a combination of above-ground and underground circuits.  Above-ground circuits consist of approximately 33,700 linear feet of 3-phase, 4/0 AWG primary lines; 8,700 linear feet of 3-phase, secondary lines; and 3,170 linear feet of single-phase lines.  Under-ground circuits consist of approximately 7,130 linear feet of three-phase, 2/0 AWG primary lines.  Both the above-ground and under-ground lines were constructed in 2001.  The equipment located in the main substation was installed in 1995 and 2001.  The overall system appears to be in fair to good condition.
  

DDJC-Tracy Gas:  Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides gas to DDJC-T via one meter/regulator station located at the southwest corner of the Installation.  At this station, the gas is reduced from 30 to 5.5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig).  DDJC-T piping ranges from 1 to 6 inches in diameter.  Piping materials consist of approximately 22,000 linear feet of coated and wrapped steel and 5,970 linear feet of 1970 vintage industrial service black steel.  The coated and wrapped steel piping is being replaced with PE under an ongoing project that is expected to be completed in July 2007.  This ongoing project is also replacing all associated valves.    

 
DDJC-Tracy Water:  The source of water for DDJC-T is three wells located on the Installation.  Each well has a vertical turbine pump that pumps water directly to a 1942 vintage 500,000-gallon ground storage tank (rehabbed in 1997), where it is chlorinated and mixed to control concentrations of manganese, iron, and nitrates.  A 1956 vintage (rehabbed in 1992), 250,000-gallon elevated steel storage tank also exists to balance flows and to provide a more stable water pressure.  The distribution system piping totals approximately 54,650 linear feet; 44,890 linear feet of asbestos cement installed in 1942 and 1953, 4,720 linear feet of ductile iron installed in 1981, and 5,040 linear feet of PVC installed in 2003.  Pipe sizes range from 6 to 16 inches in diameter.
 

DDJC-Tracy Wastewater: Domestic wastewater generated at DDJC-T is treated on-site.  The wastewater treatment plant was constructed in 1942.  The plant provides secondary treatment with a daily discharge of 30,000 gallons.  The treatment process consists of a primary clarifier, two trickling filters, secondary clarifier, anaerobic digester, chlorination chamber, sludge beds and two percolation/evaporation lagoons.  The wastewater collection piping totals approximately 30,670 linear feet, with the most common material being vitrified clay.  The piping ranges from 6 to 10 inches in diameter.  There is one lift station which collects all of the generated wastewater and pumps it to the treatment plant.  The station was constructed in 1942 and was upgraded in 2005 with new pumps and a pump control system.  A project to replace the lift station with an above-ground, packaged lift station was awarded in Sep 2006 and is expected to be completed in Mar 2007.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request for Information (RFI) for BioSense Program
<DESC>SUMMARY:  

This is a request for information only.  It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement.  All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Public Health Informatics (NCPHI) is seeking to evaluate commercial products, or products in development, and services that are suitable for use in addressing the BioSense program's requirements for data acquisition, data analysis, data presentation and reporting, and use of data for a Public Health Response, as needed.


BACKGROUND:  

BioSense is a CDC program to improve the nation's capabilities for real-time biosurveillance and health situational awareness.  To that end, BioSense develops and implements enhanced capabilities to rapidly detect and monitor bioterrorism, natural disease outbreaks, and other events of public health importance.  The primary objective is to expedite event recognition and response coordination among federal, state, and local public health and healthcare organizations by providing situational awareness to each level of public health through access to the same data, at the same time.  BioSense achieves this by connecting existing health information to public health in a way not previously possible, by providing access to data from hospitals, healthcare systems, and other sources.  
Currently, the majority of health-related information systems that exist nationally vary in their ability to share data to support immediate biosurveillance needs.  BioSense conducts near real-time biosurveillance and health situational awareness through access to existing data from these healthcare organizations across the country.  Additionally, the BioSense Program provides access to the BioSense application, a web-based system for use by healthcare facilities and state and local public health partners.

 
DESCRIPTION:  

The current BioSense operation spans four principal functions:
 -  Data Acquisition  - to assure the secure, timely, routine acquisition of health data for public health surveillance;
 -  Data Analysis - to develop, evaluate, and apply analytic signal detection methodologies and algorithms and disseminate these methodologies to selected cities and states, to interpret the results of the analysis, in as close to real-time as possible; 
 - Data Reporting - on a near real-time basis, provide useful views of the data, including time series analysis and geospatial displays, to colleagues in state and local health departments, hospital personnel, as well as to CDC programmatic staff;
 - Supporting Public Health Response - to provide local data to state and local partners and support their use and interpretation of these data for investigations, outbreak response and public health interventions.
These functions are today provided through a loosely integrated set of services.  BioSense seeks an integrated, end-to-end solution that encompasses a range of services including data source acquisition and relationship management, database design and management, hardware integration and deployment, software development and implementation, technical infrastructure support and maintenance, expert advisory services, and the required transition management.
As of December 2006, approximately 350 facilities are sending data of various types to CDC including Foundational data (aligned with the AHIC Minimum Data Set), Emergency Department, Clinical, Micro, Radiology, and Pharmacy data.  In addition, 466 Department of Defense and 863 Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics and emergency departments are sending data daily to CDC.  Further, BioSense is in some stage of implementation with healthcare organizations or existing surveillance networks representing over 700 hospitals (including their EDs and in many cases their associated ambulatory care centers).  In total, CDC has commitments from healthcare and existing systems representing more than 1,190 hospitals willing to transmit data to BioSense.
CDC's implementation goals have been defined as follows:
 -  Cumulative Hospitals:
o	350 by end of calendar year 2006
o	1,450 by end of calendar year 2007
o	2,500 by end of calendar year 2008
o	3,500 by end of calendar year 2009
 -  Veterans Affairs(VA) and Department of Defense(DoD): Real-time data feeds to be complete in 2007
 -  Commercial laboratories: 3 largest commercial laboratories reporting microbiology results with data feeds complete in 2007
 -  Poison Control Centers: 62 poison control centers, data feeds complete in early 2007

     In the near-term BioSense will focus on addressing six principal objectives:
     First, a focus on catastrophic public health emergencies, as opposed to routine public health outbreaks, given the high-risk of impact on morbidity and mortality; 
     Second, a focus on enhancing biosurveillance capabilities for major metropolitan areas given their population size and corresponding high-risk; 
     Third, a focus on achieving simultaneous data feeds from acute care hospitals to state and local public health departments as well as CDC;
     Fourth, assessing the comparative effectiveness and costs of different sub-network configurations for connecting healthcare entities and public health entities (e.g., links to individual hospitals, links to data-aggregation sites for hospital chains, and links to Regional Health Information Organizations or Health Information Exchanges;  
     Fifth, field-testing the Minimum Data Set (MDS) accepted by the American Health Information Community (AHIC) to ascertain the feasibility of adoption and to determine where modifications are necessary and what form those should take; and
     Sixth, exercise of BioSense during the 2007/2008 seasonal influenza epidemic to determine whether "proof of concept" has been attained.

   
RESPONSE:  

Data obtained from this RFI will be used by CDC in refining the acquisition strategy for the procurement of the next generation of BioSense services.  Interested organizations that have candidate products and services are invited to submit a written response to CDC.
     As a minimum, submitted information should include:
  (a)  A description of the respondent's approach to addressing the four principal functions of BioSense and the six near-term objectives;
  (b)  A description of the expected challenges in executing these functions and achieving these objectives, and the manner in which the respondent's solution addresses these challenges;
  (c)  A description of the technologies supporting the proposed approach;
  (d)  A description of the critical factors for achieving success in execution of the functions and achievement of the objectives; and
  (e)  A listing of the categories of prices and estimates of those prices on a per-unit basis, if readily available for commercial products or services, or an indication of the price estimate for products or services that are not readily available commercially.
  REMINDER:  This is not a request for proposals.  Supporting cost data is not required nor requested.  Any pricing data provided, including estimates, is informational only and will be used to help formulate and refine the Government Cost Estimate for this requirement.  This is an aspect of market research only.  Providing pricing information is optional.

All information submitted to CDC will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law, including the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 552) and the Trade Secrets Act (18 USC 1905).

<SUBJECT>74 -- American Embassy Kinshasa Standardization of Air Conditioning Units
<DESC>The American Embassy Kinshasa located in the Democratic Republic of Congo in equatorial Africa intends to standardize on Kyocera Mita copiers in support of post operations.  The goal is to implement and apply commonality, standardization, and interoperability amongst all copiers at post.  In addition, standardization reduces maintenance and overhead costs.  The Government believes that only one responsible manufacturer can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the Agency Standardization Program requirements under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
  
Environmental conditions and power fluctuations create a continuing need to repair and/or replace copiers that become unserviceable or uneconomical to maintain or operate.  Replacing electronic components in a timely manner is difficult as local companies do not consistently and reliably stock replacement parts from other manufacturers.

Standardization provides a cost effective solution and reduces maintenance and overhead costs by reducing excessive and unnecessary costs that are involved in stocking parts, tools and equipment necessary to service various copiers from multiple manufacturers.  Keeping an adequate inventory of spare parts for numerous manufacturers is very difficult and expensive.  Cannibalization and interchangeability of parts of the same manufacturer minimizes disruption to post operations.

This announcement is for informational purposes only; it is not a request for proposals or quotations.  Interested firms may send capability statements to the attention of Ms. Jan Visintainer at the email address listed below.  Capability statements must be received by February 23, 2007.  A determination by the Government to standardize this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-22 - WAND Program Proposer's Day Conference
<DESC>PROPOSER'S DAY CONFERENCE

DARPA will host a Proposer's Day Conference in support of the Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) Adaptive Network Development (WAND) effort on 27 February 2007 at George Mason University, Arlington Campus Professional Center, 3401 North Fairfax Drive, Room 239, Arlington, VA; beginning at 8 a.m. and lasting until 4:30 p.m.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the BAA 07-07, Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) Adaptive Network Development (WAND), promote additional discussion on this topic, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities. The goal of the WAND effort is to design and develop the network technologies necessary to establish ultra-large (tens of thousands of nodes), highly-scalable, highly-adaptive ad-hoc networks that provide robust networking across densely-connected deployments of inexpensive wireless nodes.  The premise of the WNaN vision is that WAND-enabled networks will adapt to changing conditions and mission requirements by adjusting the topology of the network and the operational mode of the wireless nodes, particularly at the physical and link layers, to create and maintain a rich, multiply-connected network fabric.  This rich interconnection fabric will provide superior battlefield communications at lower system cost and enhance survivability by ensuring information, applications, and services are readily available within the tactical environment.  Previous practice has been to build high cost and hence sparsely deployed nodes, and to organize the network around these nodes. This program aims to shift the approach used to design military wireless networks from design for radio range to design for node density.  WNaN has two complementary components: (1) Low-cost, multi-channel, spectrum-agile, MIMO-capable wireless nodes built with inexpensive RF circuit technology (WANN focus), and (2) Network with densely deployed low-cost wireless nodes and adaptive network layers that mitigates the shortcomings of the nodes by leveraging the rich interconnection topologies (WAND focus).  When integrated together and deployed, these two components create a distributed, intelligent network entity that is more than the sum of its parts.  The result will be a novel mobile wireless communication system that is both inexpensive and high-performance.  As currently defined, the WAND effort will include 3 sequential phases.  DARPA plans to solicit proposals for all three phases of the WAND effort with the forthcoming BAA.  The overall program concept and specific objectives will be presented at the Proposer's Day meeting.  The meeting will be unclassified and will be open to the public. Conference Registration Instructions: Conference participants are requested to register NLT 20 February 2007 at WAND@darpa.mil. Please include your name, organization, email address and phone number. Directions to the facility, local hotels and transportation information, and other materials will be emailed upon registration.  There is no fee for the conference.  The attendee list will be available at the meeting.  If you do not wish to be included on the attendee list you must send email notification to WAND@darpa.mil or call Karen Martin at 703-522-5123 by 20 February 2007.

Note that the Foreign National Visit Request, if required, must be submitted by 20 February 2007 to allow time for processing.  Presentation Instructions to Conference Participants: Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews during the conference, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so.  Presentations may have up to five (5) slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues).  Presentations must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager.  The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material. Attendees desiring to reserve a time to present at the meeting should send the presentation in a PowerPoint or PDF electronic format by 20 February 2007 to WAND@darpa.mil.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subparts 12.6 and 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested by this notice alone, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations for pickup trucks to be used by the Government of Bolivia pursuant to an agreement with the U.S. Department of State.

1.0.       DESCRIPTION

The U.S. Department of State, Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) of the U.S. Embassy in La Paz, Bolivia has a requirement for the procurement of up to 90 new pickup trucks to replace old equipment and to allow for an expansion of NAS support to counter narcotics operations in Bolivia.  The primary use of the vehicles will be for the transportation of personnel and supplies to support these operations.  The vehicles must be suitable for extensive travel in rural areas and smaller cities and towns, where deeply rutted and unpaved roads are the norm.  They must also be suitable for travel to remote and mountainous regions, which are accessible only by difficult-to-drive, twisting, narrow and unpaved roads that border on 3,000 to 5,000 foot drops.  The vehicles will also be used for travel to densely forested areas and must be dependable in heavy mud, which is often encountered during rainy season.

The vehicle offered must be capable of being maintained commercially in Bolivia in locations far from the main urban areas and must be covered by the manufacturer's warranties.  Quoters must demonstrate that the vehicles offered can withstand continuous use in Bolivia's extremely rugged terrain and harsh climatic conditions, and that the vehicles are cost-effective to operate and maintain.  The supplied vehicles are to be "new," which is defined as "having zero miles."  Low mileage and/or demonstration models are not considered to be new.  Delivery of anything other than new vehicles shall be rejected and returned at no cost to the Government.  The resulting contract type shall be firm-fixed price.

2.0.       PRICING

The Contractor shall provide the vehicles at the firm-fixed price established below.

Line Item No. 0001: Pickup Truck, Quantity: Up to 90, provide quotation showing unit price and total maximum price, including all features listed below, priced in U.S. dollars.

The above price is in terms of "Cost, Insurance and Freight" (CIF), with final delivery to be made at the Duty Free Zone at Customs in La Paz, Bolivia.  The vehicles shall be insured by the Contractor until such time as the vehicles are received by NAS in La Paz.  The Embassy will clear and title the vehicles.

This purchase order will be a firm-fixed-price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type.

3.0.       PAYMENT

Delivery of the total maximum quantity of 90 vehicles maximum shall be made in two separate deliveries as specified in Part 5.0. below (Period of Performance).

The Contractor may invoice after completion of each of the two deliveries.  Payments will not be made for partial quantities delivered.

The Contractor shall address invoices to:

U.S. Embassy - La Paz
Narcotics Affairs Section (Attn: Won Y. Lee)
Edificio USAID, Calle 9, No. 104

The vehicles are expected to operate on primary roads, secondary roads, cross country terrain and trails, as well as in deteriorated urban environments.

These vehicles will play a significant role in moving personnel and equipment from NAS support sites to remote locations, across terrain that is inaccessible by most vehicles.  The vehicles must be able to negotiate steep hills, valleys and man-made objects that are typical of the obstacles encountered in their various operating environments.  The vehicle must provide sufficient traction, as well as adequate balance and safety (in terms of overturning and/or straining the power train).  It is of the utmost importance that the vehicles provide a stable and safe platform for moving equipment and personnel into and out of operation areas.  In addition to transporting equipment and personnel, the vehicles may be used by security personnel patrolling remote areas in a force protection role, and the vehicles must be capable of being deployed quickly in response to threats.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested by this notice alone, and a written solicitation will not be issued.

4.  ACQUISITION INSTRUMENT:  Quoters should submit prices for all line items.  The U.S. Government's goal is to award an indefinite quantity purchase order for the base year and four option periods.  We are requesting prices for all years and will consider economic price adjustment clauses requested by quoters that will enable an indefinite quantity purchase order to be issued.  Any economic price adjustment clause proposed should state how and when price adjustments will be made (such as an independent price index, etc.) and an overall price ceiling, which may be stated in terms of a specific currency amount or fixed percentage.  If the U.S. Government cannot reach agreement on such an arrangement, we will then seek to award a blanket purchase agreement in accordance with FAR 13.303 at the most favorable pricing, terms, and conditions available from the quotations received in response to this notice.

5.  ESTIMATED QUANTITY: The estimated quantity per year is 7,000 gallons. This is an estimate only, not a guarantee.  The estimate is for evaluation purposes only.  Actual usage will be on an indefinite quantity basis according to the prices established.  

6.  MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM: The minimum dollar value per year is U.S.$3,000 and the maximum per year is U.S.$25,000.

7.  PERFORMANCE PERIOD: The performance period will be for a one year period, with four one-year options, beginning on date of award.

8.  ORDERING PROCEDURES: The Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) with copies of certifications, permits and legal registrations for the distribution and sale of fuel established by the government of Guatemala.  The Contractor shall provide aviation fuel upon presentation of a delivery order, which must be accompanied by an authorized NAS fuel supply form.  The authorized NAS fuel supply form indicates quantity of gallons and type of fuel to be dispensed.  The Contractor shall not accept any form that shows indications or alterations (e.g., white-out, erasing, crossing out, writing over, etc.).  Any form presented to the Contractor which is not properly authorized or with indications of alterations shall be rejected and immediately brought to the attention of the COR.  Payment will not be made by NAS for fuel that is supplied when unauthorized or altered forms are acted upon by the Contractor without notifying the COR and receiving prior authorization from the COR to provide the fuel.

The following employees are authorized to place orders:
Lourdes Stein; Ana Luisa Toledo.

The contractor shall deliver the required fuel as specified in the delivery order within 12 hours, unless a longer period is stated in the order.

9.  LAWFUL OPERATION, PERMITS, INSURANCE, AND INDEMNIFICATION:

(a) Bonds.  The Government imposes no bonding requirement on this contract.  The Contractor shall provide any official bonds required, pay any fees or costs involved or related to the authorization for the equipping of any employees engaged in providing services specified under this contract if such bonds or payments are legally required by the local government or by local practice.

(b) Employee Salary Benefits.  The Contractor shall be responsible for payment of all employee wages and benefits required by host country law or agreements with its employees.  The U.S. Government, its agencies, agents, and employees shall not be part of any legal action or obligation regarding these benefits, which may subsequently arise.  Where local law requires bonuses, specific minimum wage levels, premium pay for holidays, payments for social security, pensions, sick or health benefits, severance payments, child care or any other benefit, the Contractor is responsible for payments of these costs.

(c) Personal Injury, Property Loss or Damage (Liability).  The Contractor assumes absolute responsibility and liability for any and all personal injuries or death and property damage or losses suffered due to negligence of the Contractor's personnel in the performance of this contract.  The Contractor's assumption of absolute liability is independent of any insurance policies.

(d) Amount of Insurance.  The Contractor is required to obtain whatever insurance is legally required.  The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the entire performance period of the contract any type or types of insurance required by local law or that are ordinarily or customarily obtained in the location of the work.  The limit of such insurance shall be as provided by law or sufficient to meet normal and customary claims.
The Contractor agrees that the Government shall not be responsible for personal injuries or for damages to: 1) any property of the Contractor, 2) its officers, 3) agents, 4) servants,
5) employees, or 6) any other person, arising from and incident to the Contractor's performance under this contract.  

The Contractor shall hold harmless and indemnify the U.S. Government from any and all claims arising, except in the instance of gross negligence on the part of the U.S. Government.

(e) Permits.  Without additional cost to the U.S. Government, the Contractor shall obtain all permits, licenses, and appointments required for the prosecution of work under this contract.  The Contractor shall obtain these permits, licenses, and appointments in compliance with applicable host country laws.  The Contractor shall provide evidence of possession or status of application for such permits, licenses, and appointments to the COR with its quotation.  Application, justification, fees, and certifications for any licenses required by the host government are entirely the responsibility of the Contractor.

10.  EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS:
The primary technical considerations for award of a purchase order or BPA will be whether the fuel and related service are suitable for the intended purpose and whether they can be delivered on time.  The quoter offering acceptable items and terms that most closely match the Government's needs and required delivery will receive most favorable consideration from a technical standpoint.  The Government intends to award to the lowest priced technically acceptable quoter.  Lowest price will be the aggregate sum of all line item prices, including consideration of any economic price adjustment clause and ceiling.

11.  QUOTATION MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

(a) PRICE: Fixed price per gallon, inclusive of delivery charges.  Describe any price adjustment clause proposed.
(b) DESCRIPTION: Description of fuel and related services being proposed. Quotation must include a narrative explanation of how the quoter will perform the work.
(c) REFERENCES: Names and points of contacts of other Government or commercial customers for whom the quoter has performed this or similar work for in the past two (2) years.

Q1. Do you want server enterprise on each system with a total of 50 user lic or 10 per enclosure?

A1. We are asking for 10 Microsoft Windows Server 2003 licenses to go with the 10 that we already have. These 10 additional licenses combined with the 10 existing licenses will cover the 20 blade servers in this procurement. 

Q2. Could you please clarify on the I/O connections required for the blades?

In the requirement lists, it states:

Interconnects (internal): must support 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 4 Gb Fiber
Channel, 20Gb Infiniband. Also must support Cisco, Brocade, Mellanox,
Emulex, Qlogic, and Blade Network Technology. Fiber channel must support
interconnects to Clarion SAN.

Are infiniband switching, SAN and ethernet switching required separately
in one chassis? Note that with infiniband protocol, one I/O protocol can
carry both networking and storage (ethernet and SAN) data, all in the
same channel.

Moreover, infiniband are usually used with HPC (High Performance
Computing) environment, is the customer operating under such an
environment?

A2. At present we do not have the environment in question but with the new servers we could upgrade our services. We are also looking for redundancy for both ethernet and fiber and infiniband could be utilized for that.


Q3. Does the server need to be single phase or 3-phase? What type or network will these be used on?

A3. The power to the area is single phase and we request redundant power for the racks. This will be used in a windows network environment.

3.1.1	The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment and supervision necessary to inventory, reassemble, and arrange 99 workstations per the Government's specifications.  The furniture manufacturer is Herman Miller.

3.2.1	The contractor shall develop, as necessary, an inventory of panels and connectors.

3.2.2	The work shall be performed during normal business hours of Monday through Friday; 7:30 AM to 4:00 PM unless directed to be performed after duty hours.  Loading dock access will be provided as necessary.

    To accommodate the above, the contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), with the name of contractor personnel requiring access and their expected date/time of arrival at the earliest practical moment.  The COR will initiate actions in accordance with current DFAS-CO procedures concerning visitors to accommodate contractor employees.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation procurement and a total small business set aside.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) number HSTS03-07-R-ACQ913 is to establish multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to obtain Strategic Management Support Services for the Transportation Security Administration.


****************************************************************


This procurement will be conducted using the Transportation Security Administration Acquisition Management System (TSAAMS).  Interested parties may learn more about the Acquisition Management System at http://fast.faa.gov.  TSA is exempted from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA ? Public Law 107-71) and empowered to use TSAAMS by the same authority. 


****************************************************************


All interested vendors must contact TSA's Office of Acquisition (OA) for a copy of the RFP, which contains the instructions, Statement of Work, Past Performance Survey, and Non-Disclosure Agreement.  The RFP contains all Evaluation Factors that will be used by TSA in considering the technical merit of each response. The RFP also contains instructions on the format of responses, including page length.  All interested offerors are hereby made aware that in order to be considered, they must submit a technical and price proposal that covers all aspects of the SOW, not selected parts of the SOW.  However, TSA is willing to consider the merit of any proposed subcontracting or teaming arrangements meeting the Limitations in Subcontracting requirements.  

TSA's primary point of contact is Ms. Quyen Diep, who can be reached at 571-227-2997 or e-mail at Quyen.Diep@dhs.gov.  If Ms. Diep is not available, please contact Mr. Marvin Grubbs at 571-227-1581 or e-mail at Marvin.Grubbs@dhs.gov.    Please contact Ms. Diep NO LATER THAN February 9, 2007 to receive a copy of the RFP via e-mail only. Any questions about this synopsis/solicitation shall be directed in writing to Ms. Diep.  The deadline to submit a technical and price proposal is indicated in the RFP letter and will not be extended unless the Contracting Officer determines that an extension is necessary to maintain the competitive nature of the procurement.


****************************************************************


AMENDMENT 08 TO RFP HSTS03-07-R-ACQ913:  The purpose of this amendment is to publicize responses to additional questions submitted on February 12, 2007.

***Question 1: Page 8 ? SOW ? Conflict of Interest.  The SOW indicates the following:  ?This procurement contains a potential OCI.  The awardee and all subcontractors/team partners will not be allowed to compete for any integration or implementation requirement outcomes related to work within the SOW?.  Assuming the government awards the BPA to multiple firms, if one firm performs work on a TO, then the firm performing the work on the TO would be conflicted from any subsequent follow-on or implementation work, and not ALL firms under the BPA.  Can the government clarify the OCI as it relates to firms not involved in the original TO?

Answer 1:  The OCI applies on a task order basis.

***Question 2: Is TSA going to extend the deadline for Responses?

Answer 2: The due date for proposal submission has been extended to February 23, 2007 at 2:00PM EST (see Amendment 06).  

***Question 3: On page page 6 of 24 in the TSA Letter, it is stated, ?For any subcontractor or partner performing a critical element of the work, please furnish at least three references of similar projects.? It does not say in the letter that the subcontractors had to send surveys out to their clients. However, in the Q&A response, it was indicated that subcontractors were required to send these surveys out.  Since the surveys were not a clear requirement in the RFP, is it possible to get an extension on the past performance survey due date?

Answer 3: Per the letter, wthis BPA?

Answer 6:  See response to Question 2.

***Question 7: Reference RFP Section IV, Volume 1 ? Technical Response and Past Performance on page 7:  The first sentence of the second paragraph of the above-referenced section states that ?[o]fferors are cautioned the award of this BPA may preclude them from offering on other TSA procurements where related work, as procured, would directly affect contractual performance.?  It is assumed that this preclusion would only apply in the event that it is determined that a conflict, or potential conflict, of interest, as defined in Section XI of the RFP, existed.  Is this a correct assumption?  It is assumed that this preclusion is limited to work within TSA and would not impact work DHS-wide.  Is this a correct assumption?

Answer 7:  Both assumptions are correct.  However, there could be an OCI within another DHS entity that either utilizes TSA efforts or partners with TSA on DHS initiatives.  It is all situational.

***Question 8: Reference RFP page 1: The Subject line of the Request for Proposal states that the purpose of the RFP is to establish multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to obtain Strategic Management Support Services for the Transportation Security Administration.  How many BPAs does TSA anticipate awarding?

Answer 8:  To be determined.  TSA may award a single, multiple or no BPA.

***Question 9: Reference RFP Section IV, Volume 1 ? Technical Response and Past Performance on page 6: The list of items to be included for each past performance reference includes as item 5, ?[l]ength of the referenced projects? and as item 6, ?[p]eriod of performance?.  How are these items different from one another?

Answer 9: Length of projects refers to projects while period of performance refers to the duration of the contract.

***Question 10: Reference RFP Section IV, Volume 1 ? Technical Response and Past Performance on page 7:  The first sentence on this page states that ?[i]n the event that references are contracted by TSA, the Offeror shall ensure that these reference contacts have been authorized to respond to TSA?s inquiries related to this solicitation.?  What are examples of how the Offeror might comply with this statement?

Anwer 10:  It would be beneficial for offerors to notify their references of possible calls from TSA regarding the past or current work experience with the offeror so they may be prepared to answer questions from TSA.

***Question 11: Reference Statement of Work, Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Section on page 8:  The last sentence in this section states that ??contractor personnel will be required to take TSA-sponsored training courses such as IT Security and Security Sensitive Information.?  It is assumed that the Contractor will be reimbursed for the time associated with attending these training courses.  Is this a correct assumption?

Anwer 11:  The assumption is correct.

***Question 12: What justification, if any, is required for the hourly fixed labor rates?  

Answer 12: Offerors may provide as much detail as they deem appropriate for the Government to determine the proposed labor rate is fair and reasonable.  Please note that this is a highly competitive procurement.

***Question 13: Will task order management be allowable as a direct billable rate under the resultant BPA?

Answer 13: No, only work under any resultant task order(s) is billable.

***Question 14: Will indirect rate expense applied to travel costs be allowable, if it's standard accounting policy and practice for the offeror?

Answer 14: Authorized travel costs will be billed as ODCs. Audit approved G&A may be applied to the ODCs

***Question 15: Will incidental item(s) or additional labor category(ies) be allowed for negotiation at the task order level, should the blanket BPA not have the applicable labor category required to perform services?

Answer 15: No, we want all labor rates for any potential efforts on the BPAs. Incidental items such as travel will be added per task order requirement as applicable.

***Question 16: Page 4 of the RFP Evaluation Criteria #6, Management Approach, requires an EVMS cost/schedule control system or proposed management procedures that comply with the requirements of producing a Cost/Schedule Status Report.  In the case where an EVMS system is available from a small business contractor, the RFP requests documentation of such recognition in lieu of detailing the management procedures.  If the offeror has management procedures already in place at TSA that are accepted as a source for similar Cost/Schedule Status Reports regardless of reliance on an EVMS, will the government accept documentation of acceptance of current procedures by TSA officials in lieu of detailing the procedures?

Answer 16: This question is vague.  It is incumbent of each offeror to clearly identify and discuss its expertise in each area. How each offeror approached this is up to each offeror.

***Question 17: Page 1 of the SOW requires the offeror to demonstrate capability for ?all specific tasks described under ?Technical Requirements??.   Neither the RFP nor the SOW has a designated ?Technical Requirements? section.  Subsequent SOW discussions on pages 2-5 refer to potential ?Task Orders?, ?Various tasks?, additional ?select tasks? and ?specific requirements of the different task orders?.   Could the government clarify which set of specific tasks will be evaluated as ?Technical Requirements??  

Answer 17: The Scope section of the SOW refers to the technical requirements of the BPA.

***Question 18: Volume 2 ? Price Schedule requests a proposed labor mix.  Given the broad range potential tasks orders under the BPA, and the resultant variation in staff mix and skills required address specific tasks, how will the government evaluate competitive proposals that may have different interpretations of the collective BPA work?  Will the government provide additional information on a potential market basket of task orders for purposes of developing a proposed labor mix?  

Answer 18: Any proposed labor mix will be evaluated for the ability to meet the requirements as stated in the SOW, which represent the potential work for any future task orders.  Offerors are not limited in the various labor categories they can propose for the BPA(s).

***Question 19: Page 22 of the RFP ? Section XIV ? Key Personnel For Delivery and BPA Calls.  Section (g) indicates ?The following personnel and or facilities under this contract are: [list key personnel and/or facilities].  Can the government please clarify specific key personnel if any?

Answer 19: Offerors are expected to review Section XIV (Key Personnel for Delivery and BPA Calls) of the RFP for the definition of key personnel and identify appropriate personnel in Section XIV (g).  Traditionally, the BPA manager and contracts manager, for example, are key personnel of the BPA. Additional Key Personnel for task orders will be identified as solicited.

***Question 20: Page 4 ? SOW. Critical Incident Management.  Please provide additional clarification related to specific requirements of the different task orders and integrated efforts of management and core competency development services listed in the SOW. Can the government explain in more detail what developing a Critical Incident Management? as a core agency competency at the Executive, senior management and field operational level with emphasis on training and skill development would entail?

Answer 20: Critical Incident Management is broad and could entail any level. As example, critical incident management is important in the planning and implementation of various emergency responses to natural and human disasters. These responses could be due to terrorist attacks, extreme weather conditions, acts of war, or large-scale accidents and tragedies. One of the intents of the BPA(s) is to plan and structure appropriate responses to incidents by the use of strategic planning, analysis, and effective critical incident response.

***Question 21: Page 4 ? SOW. Network Governance. Please provide additional clarification related to specific requirements of the different task orders and integrated efforts of management and core competency development services listed in the SOW. Can the government explain in more detail regarding ?Improvement of TSA?s capacity for network governance internally, with industry partners, contract service providers and other stakeholder communities?? 

Answer 21: See the response to Question 4.

AMENDMENT 07 TO RFP HSTS03-07-R-ACQ913:  The solicitation is amended to include TSA AMS clause 3.2.2.3-14 Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  The full text of the clause can be found online at http://www.tsa.gov/join/business/business_tsaams.shtm.  

Additionally, this amendment will publicize responses to questions submitted between February 9, 2007 and February 12, 2007.

***Question 1: If multiple vendors are awarded a BPA, what will the process be to award task orders?

Answer 1: All BPA Calls/Task Orders will be competed amongst all BPA awardees via request for quotation.  Note: There is no guarantee of any award of a task order.

***Question 2: How soon after BPA award do you anticipate issuing the first task order?

Answer 2: To be determined.  Any resultant task order is based on requirements, if any, from TSA program offices.

***Question 3: How soon after BPA award do you anticipate starting work?

Answer 3: See response to Question 2.

***Question 4: Provide more detail regarding the Network Governance requirement?

Answer 4: Network governance, in and of itself, has various definitions that ideally center around collaboration.  Here is an example of the various types of definitions:
http://www.analytictech.com/borgatti/netgov2.htm.

***Question 5: Elaborate on ?technical subject matter expertise?

Answer 5: Each offeror?s ability to provide individuals that are technical subject matter experts to perform the work within the BPA and resultant task order(s).

***Question 6: What volume of work (in terms of dollars) is anticipated under e require references from the prime and any subcontractor or partner performing a critical element of the work.  To help us evaluate those references and the offerors? past performance, we asked the surveys be sent to the references (?To streamline the Government's past performance evaluation process, the offeror shall provide the Past Performance Survey (Attachment 2) to each of the references included in their proposal for completion? on page 6).  
 
Also, please note at the bottom of page 6, we state ?Surveys received after the closing date for receipt of proposals will be accepted, but it is imperative that Offerors advise their references that the survey be submitted and faxed in a timely manner.?

***Question 4: On RFP page 5 of 24, Section IV, reference is made to "12-pitch" type font.  I am assuming that should read 12-point font.  Is that correct?  Also, does the 12-point font restriction apply to all text within a graphic?

Answer 4: No, the font requirement does not apply to all text within a graphic.

***Question 5:Are you only requiring pricing from the prime?

Answer 5:  No, pricing from the prime and subcontractors, if any, is required for any work that may ever be ordered under the BPA(s).

***Question 6: In the RFP Letter, Evaluation Criteria 4, Proposed Approach, would you please provide clarification to the language ?developing performance capabilities??

Answer 6: Developing performance capabilities means exactly that.

***Question 7: It requires quite a bit of information to provide a response to this RFP, will the government consider increasing the page limitation for Volume I?

Answer 7: No.

***Question 8:  Does the title page, table of contents, and cover letter count towards the total page count for Volume 1 and/or Volume 2?

Answer 8: Yes.

***Question 9: The fourth paragraph under the Scope of the SOW states, ?The contractor must be capable of providing proven technical support for all specific tasks described under Technical Requirements.?  There is no ?Technical Requirements? heading in the SOW.  Is the list at the top of page 2 the ?Technical Requirements? or, is the list under ?Demonstrated Specialized Experience? on page 2 of the RFP the technical requirements?

Answer 9:  The Scope section of the SOW refers to the technical requirements of the BPA.  The ?Demonstrated Specialized Experience? section of the RFP lists experience that would indicate the offerors ability to satisfy the technical requirements.

***Question 10: In our response to the RFP, do we have to add summary information regarding our experience in all areas?  If so, could the RFP be changed to cover a large portion of the "Technical Requirements"?

Answer 10: How much information to provide regarding experience in specific areas is at the offeror?s discretion.  No, the RFP will not be changed.
 
***Question 11: Speaking of Technical Requirements, it's referenced on the first page of the SOW but which section is actually the Technical Requirements section because we did not see a section with that name.
 
Answer 11: See the response to Question 9.  

***Question 12: Can the work used for past performance be in currently progress?  We have a situation where we are in the 2nd option year of a contract.

Answer 12:  Yes, current work can be used for past performance information.
 
***Question 13: With respect to the past performance survey, how are primes to relate (to themselves) the past performances of subs?  In other words, there is no way to know who the prime is once a sub's past client submits the past performance survey.

Answer 13: Please ask your references to indicate the prime/subcontractor relationship on the surveys in order to provide a better context for the evaluation of the work.

***Question 14: What percentage of the work can be subcontracted to a non small business and still meet TSA's requirements?

Answer 14: Please see TSA AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting contained in the RFP. 

***Question 15: Is it possible to receive a few days extension so staff is not working full time on a holiday weekend?  

Answer 15: The due date for proposal submission has been extended to February 23, 2007 at 2:00PM EST.

***Question 16: Is it possible to receive copies of Q&A submitted by other vendors?

Answer 16:  All Q&A have been posted on Fed Biz Opps.

***Question 17: The RFP requires "three (3) relevant, recent contract" references.  If the offeror is proposing a two (2) or three (3) company team, does TSA want three (3) references from each company, or just three (3) from the entire team? 
 
Answer 17: Per the letter, we require references from the prime and any subcontractor or partner performing a critical element of the work.
 
***Question 18: The RFP states that proposed personnel "must possess or be eligible for a security clearance".  What does this mean?  Must the offeror propose only personnel who currently have security clearances, or does it mean that the individual's background is such that an investigation would permit granting a security clearance at the required level.  In some cases, the required investigation may take up to several months.  If an offeror proposed uncleared, but clearable, personnel, would it adversely affect evaluation of its proposal?  How can we mitigate such a circumstance?

Answer 18: Security clearance requirements, if applicable, will vary with each resultant task order.  It is expected offerors will propose qualified personnel with the highest probability of obtaining the required security clearances if they do not already have them.  Please note that clearances are not required for a BPA as a BPA does not guarantee orders.  Vendors must show evidence that they can provide people that possess or are eligible for a security clearance.

***Question 19: For the past performance, there is a requirement for three surveys to be completed by this Thursday, 2/15/07. We are concerned that the pending winter weather mix may cause issues in the government completing these surveys. Will you provide an extension to our customers who are completing the three surveys?

Answer 19: See the response to Question 3.

***Question 20: In our technical response, are we required to provide at least three references per subcontractor or is that the minimum for the team?

Answer 20:  See the response to Question 17.

***Question 21: The SOW states that, "The awardee and all subcontractors/team partners will not be allowed to compete for any integration or implementation requirement outcomes related to work within the SOW."  If the awardee/prime contractor receives a task order under the BPA, and only the awardee/prime contractor performs work on that particular task order, will the subcontractors/team partners who did not perform work under that particular task order not be allowed to compete for any integration or implementation requirement outcomes related to work within the SOW of the task order even though only the awardee/prime contractor performed work on that SOW?

Answer 21: See the response to Question 1.

***Question 22: Will TSA negotiate pricing before disqualifying bidders?

Answer 22:  No.  The purpose of this procurement is to establish technically prequalified and competitively priced BPA(s).
 
***Question 23: Shall we submit one email with our Technical Proposal and one email with our Pricing Proposal or, should we submit one email with our Technical and Pricing proposals in separate documents?

Answer 23:  How proposals are emailed is at the offeror?s discretion.  However, please be cognizant of file size so that the e-mail will transmit successfully.
 
***Question 24: Does this question in page 1 of the SOW mean that each person must possess these skills or that each group of people submitted by the bidder must collectively possess these skills:  ?The contractor must be capable of providing proven technical support for all specific tasks described under Technical Requirements?? 

Answer 24: It is expected the group of people (i.e. proposed labor categories) proposed must collectively possess these skills.
 
***Question 25: Can Past Performance from customers who do not return a survey be included in the Technical proposal? If so, do these descriptions count towards the 15 pages allowed?  Question and Answer 8 (of Amendment 2 posted on ????, 2007, responses to questions submitted between January 31 and February 5, 2007).     

Answer 25:  Past performance reference information may be included in the Technical proposal regardless whether the reference completes a Past Performance Survey.  The past performance reference information is excluded from the page count limitation.

***Question 26: Regarding the Organizational Conflict of Interest section: ?This procurement contains a potential OCI.  The awardee and all subcontractors/team partners will not be allowed to compete for any integration or implementation requirement outcomes related to work within the SOW. An OCI mitigation plan will not be considered.? Will the Government remove the restriction stating that an OCI mitigation plan will not be considered and accept a comprehensive OCI Plan that includes an associated corporate firewall, as a suitable means of protecting against organizational conflicts of interest?  Specifically, if measures, as agreed to by the Government, are undertaken by the Contractor to firewall the organization within the Contractor performing task order work under this BPA, will this remove the restriction on the other organizations within the Contractor from participating in future procurements associated with these initiatives?

Answer 26: Offerors may submit a Mitigation Plan for each resultant task order.  On page 8 of the Statement of Work (Attachment 1 of the RFP), the sentence ?An OCI mitigation plan will not be considered? is hereby replaced with ?An OCI mitigation plan will be considered on an individual basis for each task order?.
 
***Question 27: In the RFP and associated SOW, does ?risk management? apply to project risk, enterprise risk, or external risk?  That is:  is the task/capability required relative to a system that mitigates risks to TSA arising from this project, or to risk analysis/risk assessment expertise to help evaluate the efficacy of various TSA initiatives/activities in terms of public safety?

Answer 27: As it is used in the SOW (the second bullet and numbers 6, 7, and 8 on Page 2 and in the paragraphs entitled "Strategic Planning", "Risk Management", and "Grants" on pages 3 and  4, respectively), "risk" refers to external risk to (or through) transportation (mostly terrorism, not completely excluding other hazards).  This includes but is not limited to "evaluat[ing] the efficacy of TSA initiatives/activities"; much broader, in that it may evaluate the efficacy of other actors' activities, or the need for some initiatives/activities where none exists, or the potential efficacy of proposed initiatives/activities, etc.
