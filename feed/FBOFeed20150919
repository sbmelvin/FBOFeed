<DESC>This is an INTENT TO MAKE A SINGLE SOURCE AWARD only. 

The Department of Veteran Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 21, intends to issue a single source purchase order to Bay Medic Transportation. This single-source procurement is in accordance with FAR 13.106-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements) for inter-facility ground transportation services for the VA Martinez campus. Services will be from 10/1/15-11/30/2015 with a one month option period under NAICS 621910.

The contractor shall provide Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Life Support (ALS), and Critical Care Transport (CCT) ambulance services to all of the defined areas, and such service will include all labor, materials, equipment and supplies that might be required.  This is a short-term sole source contract that will be from October 1, 2015 through November 30, 2015 with one one-month option period to allow addition time for contract negotiation on a long-term contract for the region.  Bay Medic Transportation, Inc. has been providing the service with the existing contract.  It is not possible, nor prudent to attempt to allow for competition of this highly crucial service for the short-term contract.  Any attempt to do so would divert limited resources and put the continued service at risk.

This notice is neither a request for quotes nor a solicitation of offers; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. No solicitation package is available. A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and on an all or none basis. Interested parties must respond to this notice no later than 8:00 am on September 25, 2015. When responding to this announcement, respondents should refer to Announcement VA261-15-Q-1267 in the subject line. 

Responding as an interested party under the www.fbo.gov website doesn't constitute convincing evidence of capabilities. All interested parties are reminded to be registered with System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ in order to be eligible for award of Government contracts. No telephone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to award a sole source contract to the University of Maryland for a period of four years. This will be a cost contract to provide further research work under project number ER-2135, entitled,  quote mark Application of Biofilm-Covered Activated Carbon Particles as a Microbial Inoculum Delivery System for Enhanced Bioaugmentation of PCBs in Contaminated Sediment. quote mark   These services are expected to further understand research that was originally contracted through Goucher College under contract W912HQ-11-C-0057. The objective of the SERDP Exploratory Development (SEED) Statement of Need (SON) under the Environmental Restoration program area,  quote mark In Situ Remediation of Contaminated Aquatic Sediments quote mark  was to develop innovative technologies for in situ remediation of contaminated aquatic sediments. Research proposals were sought that addressed issues such as (1) ability to achieve contaminant degradation or sequestration; (2) bioavailability of sequestered contaminants; (3) amendment placement, distribution, and stability; and (4) long-term effectiveness of amendment or active cap. Under this SON, Goucher College was selected and awarded for funding under contract W912HQ-11-C-0057.  In the initial year of the study at Goucher College, they conducted a proof-of-concept study where biofilm inoculum on activated carbon particles was applied as a delivery system for contaminated sediment with high total PCB concentrations.  The results showed that bioaugmentation with the biofilm inoculums enhanced the PCB dechlorination compared to liquid inoculums and that the biofilm bacteria survived in the sediment environment and remained active throughout the 200 day experiment. The continued research will expand on these initial results by testing the application of dechlorinating bacterial biofilms on sorptive materials for treating sediments.  Furthermore, the goal is to demonstrate that the observed mass loss that was observed at higher PCB concentrations also will occur when the initial PCB concentrations are much lower as is the case for weathered PCB contaminated sediment.  This will be tested by applying biofilm inoculums associated with activated carbon as a delivery system.  Development and testing of a delivery system that will build upon the positive results from the biofilm based inoculums on activated carbon, developed under the initial year, will be performed.  Specifically, delivery systems that apply biofilm on Fe impregnated activated carbon particles as well as activated carbon covered with anaerobic and aerobic PCB degrading bacteria in biofilm will be evaluated in order to further enhance the bioaugmentation of recalcitrant PCBs in weathered sediment.  This addresses the need to develop innovative in situ technologies to remediate contaminated aquatic sediments.  The results produced from this research will assist in the development of the next generation of contaminated sediment management tools, resulting in more efficient reduction of risks at lower costs. <br>  <br>  <br> This is a Notice of Intent to sole source for non-commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  Part 15, as supplemented with additional information included in the notice 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services.  However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement and/or a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency, within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. NO RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a cost contract to the University of Maryland.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)
(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.    (b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.    Solicitation:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            Item No.                  Supplies/Service        Quantity        Unit      Unit price      Amount ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0001............................

7 LAWRENCE STREET, NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ  08901
<DESC>Base Bid Work:  The work includes the renovation of the existing industrial printing center located in the north fire bay of Bldg. 06 at the Naval Support Activity, Mechanicsburg, PA. The project shall provide a code compliant printing office, with warehouse space. The scope of work will involve only the north fire bay of Bldg. 06 which is 200 by 200.  The project involves constructing an office approximately 100 X 100 for the printing operation inside the fire bay, including office walls, ceiling, lighting, HVAC, sprinklers, fire alarm, communication wiring and incidental related work.  The existing printing operation must be protected and must remain in operation during the entire construction period.
 The new printing facility will be built in an empty part of the fire bay and when it is completed, the existing equipment will be moved into the new space.

THE CONTRACTOR SHALL HAVE A TOTAL 350 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT AWARD TO COMPLETE THE BASE BID WORK.

OPTION Work: This project contains an option for additional fire sprinkler and fire alarm work. See BID OPTION note on sheet G-002. Some of the fire sprinkler replacement and the fire alarm upgrade has been set aside as an option. The fire sprinklers within the printing center and the sprinklers located above the print center ceiling are part of the Base Bid. Fire sprinkler replacement in the remainder of the warehouse and fire alarm upgrades are included in the Bid Option.
 The existing sprinkler system shall remain in operation to the maximum extent possible during construction. All system outages shall be coordinated with facility management and the NAVFAC MIDATLANTIC FIRE PROTECTION ENGINEER. System demolition shall not begin until the new sprinkler system is installed and operational.  See sheets FD-101A, F-101A and FA-101 for more detail on the Bid Option work.

NOTE:  IF THIS OPTION IS EXERCISED, AN ADDITIONAL 30 DAYS WILL BE ADDED TO THE CONTRACT COMPLETION DATE FOR A TOTAL OF 380 DAYS FOR CONTRACT COMPLETION.  THE WORK REQUIRED BY THE OPTION CAN BE PERFORMED CONCURRENT TO THE WORK REQUIRED BY THE BASE BID WORK; HOWEVER, OFFERORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT SOME ACCESS ISSUES MAY BE PRESENTED.
  THESE ACCESS ISSUES HAVE BEEN FACTORED INTO THE CONTRACT COMPLETION DATE.

IF OPTION 1 (CLIN 0002) IS NOT AWARDED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BASE BID WORK, THEN OPTION 1 MAY BE AWARDED WITHIN 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF AWARD.  NO CHANGE TO THE CONTRACT COMPLETION DATE WILL BE REQUIRED, I.E. THE TOTAL TIME FOR PERFORMANCE OF THE BASE AND OPTION WILL BE 380 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF AWARD.
