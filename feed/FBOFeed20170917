<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION; A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND QUOTATIONS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Fisher Scientific (part of Thermo Fisher Scientific) to purchase a QuantStudio 6 flex real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) system to support the Neuropharmacology section of the Neurobiology Laboratory. This acquisition will be conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The FAR as supplemented by the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) will be used to evaluate the quote and award this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334516 "Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing" and has a size standard of 1,000 employees.).&nbsp; <br /><br />
<p>The mission of the NIEHS is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. Neurobiology is an integral part of environmental health sciences. Disruption of brain development and function produces life-long effects on human cognitive potential. The Neurobiology Laboratory investigates the cellular and molecular processes in the developing and aging nervous system that increase its vulnerability to environmental toxicants. The Neuropharmacology section of the Neurobiology Laboratory is in need of a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) system with interchangeable sample holders (i.e., 96-well, 96-well Fast and 384 well plates formats) for an ongoing study on the role of brain neuroimmune function in inflammation-related Neurodeqeneration. The lab needs a new PCR system that is compatible with current reagents and supplies used in lab as different calibration data can affect the analysis results of ongoing experiments. Each experiment file stores the calibration data from the instrument it was run on. In addition, changes to sequencing kits, protocols and instrument firmware can affect the base composition of sequencing data. Moreover, bias is known to vary between laboratories, from run to run or even from lane to lane on the same flowcell. Such variability and instability in the system confound comparative studies and render systematic bias investigations difficult. The lab has used Taqman assays with target primers and sequence specific probes for greater than 10 years using the predecessors to the QuantStudio. The QuantStudio 6 flex real-time PCR system will allow for continued use of these assays and supplies without having to optimize new protocols and procedures with a different machine. This allows for continuity of research progress in the lab. The Quantstudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System must offer the capabilities and features described in Attachment I - Statement of Work (SOW).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION; A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND QUOTATIONS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Macrogen Clinical Laboratory process and prepare whole genome sequencing of seven (7) human samples to a mean mappable coverage of 60X for the Mechanisms of Genome Dynamics Group (MGDG). This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The FAR as supplemented by the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) will be used to evaluate the quote and award this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380, "Testing Laboratories" with a size standard of $15.0M.
<p><br />The mission of the NIEHS is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. The Branches &amp; Laboratories at NIEHS fall under the Intramural Research Division (IRD) and the National Toxicology Program (NTP). The MGDG falls under the Genome Integrity &amp; Structural Biology Laboratory. Members of the Mechanisms of Genome Dynamics Group are interested in identifying the mechanisms, genetic defects, and environmental factors that lead to the extreme risks of genome instability. The outcomes of their work encompass areas of DNA replication and various DNA repair pathways. Methodology includes the state of the art yeast experimental models, as well as sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of yeast and human genomes, turning them into reporters of genome instability. The MGDG has a need for continued support on an ongoing research project on whole genome sequencing of seven (7) human samples to a mean mappable coverage of 60X. Sequencing data provides vital information to ongoing investigations regarding environmental disease mechanisms and the genetic, genomic, and epigenomic components of susceptibility, outcomes and progression of environmental diseases. In order to maintain the integrity of current research projects and research data continuity it is imperative that additional sequencing be provided using the same technology currently in use. Macrogen Clinical Laboratory is currently performing whole-genome sequencing of MGDG's materials under the ongoing study. All of MGDG's current analytical pipelines have been designed and optimized to operate with the sequencing data produced by Macrogen, As such, continued use of Macrogen for whole-genome sequencing is required to meet research standards and to produce data compatible by platform and format with already accumulated whole-genome sequencing data. The Contractor shall perform the tasks described in Attachment I - Statement of Work (SOW).</p>

<DESC>SOCOM is seeking industry input to identify potential solutions for a Small VTOL Unmanned Aircraft System, capable of providing Reconnaissance and Surveillance during day and night operations. The system should be rugged, lightweight, and ready to use as delivered with minimal logistic, training and support equipment. The system should provide real-time full motion video via electro-optical and infrared sensors. The air vehicles should be capable of autonomous or a safe manual launch with a minimum of support equipment from a small confined area, and should be capable of either a manual or autonomous recovery within the same area as launch. The recovery method should be adequate to prevent system damage and allow for short turn-around times between missions. The ground control station should be man-portable and consist of the necessary equipment to monitor the sensor(s) position and status, control its movement and view its video.<br /><br /><br />*** See attachments for more detail.

<DESC>Army Unit conducts Close Air Support (CAS) training. The purpose of this training is to exercise tactical control of CAS through airspace management and de-confliction, sensor employment (to include postures, personnel tracking and reconnaissance) along with terminal attack guidance under realistic conditions that replicate the scale, diversity and complexity of the operational environments encountered during current overseas combat operations. This training will ensure that Army Unit Joint Tactical Air Controllers (JTACs) and Joint Field Offices (JFOs) are fully qualified and proficient at controlling CAS, a critical requirement for maintaining force preservation, freedom of movement and precise application of lethal effects overseas. In order to ensure that these critical skills are mastered, it is a requirement that this specialty be out sourced in order to maintain synchronization with follow on critical mission training events in the current resource constrained environment.<br /><br />*** See attachment for all details

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS) requires thee (3) Remote Livestock Management Systems. This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation announcement for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Solicitation number AG-8KAP-S-17-0010 (See Attached Solicitation) is issued as a request for quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-93 corrections. North American Classification Coded (NAICS) 423820, Agricultural machinery and equipment merchant wholesalers, is applicable.
<p>This announcement is not set-aside.</p>
<p>The Vendor shall provide Three (3) The Remote Livestock Management Systems to enable researchers to monitor individual cattle weight gain and daily activity in a pasture whenever they come to water. This provides real time tracking of animal growth rates (through the data being available through remote data connections) while reducing stress associated with gathering and weighing at remote scale sites, thus enhancing animal well-being. The Remote Livestock Management System should have solid field testing on several ranches to show validity and reproducibility of research data. This daily objective measurement of livestock production will be used for adaptive management decisions such as when to move animals from one pasture to another. This key feature with the Remote Livestock Management System would provide highly valuable data for our Adaptive Grazing Management experiment (the common experiment for the Long-Term Agro-ecosystem Research, LTAR, network site at the Central Plains Experimental Range), where a Stakeholder group is making real-time management decisions on cattle movement across pastures for this experiment.</p>
<p>Delivery location is: U. S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service USDA-ARS-NPA RRSRU-HPGRS, 8408 Hildreth Road, Cheyenne, WY 82009</p>
<p>The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract on 9/25/2017.</p>
<p>As authorized by FAR 5.102, solicitation dissemination is limited to electronic medium, and the USDA/ARS will provide no hard copies.</p>
<p>The successful company must mandatorily be registered in the SAM (System for Award Management) at web site: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Address ALL questions in WRITING to the issuing office via email to Shannon.Boyd@ars.usda.gov . No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p>PAYMENT: Any award made under this solicitation is subject to 31 CFR Part 208 which requires all payments made by the government to be made by electronic funds transfer. Please note on your proposal if you will accept a government purchase (VISA) card.</p>
<p>All sources wishing to provide a quotation must respond by 9/24/2017 @ 1500MT. <br />Applicable Provisions: The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Department of Agriculture Acquisition Regulation (AGAR) provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.204-7 System for Award Management: AGAR 452.204-70 Inquiries; FAR 52.209-6 Protecting the Government's Interests when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended or Proposed for Debarment; FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offers-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (filled in as follows: Technical specifications/support, and price); FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders-Commercial Items; AGAR 452.219-70 Size Standard and NAICS Code Information; FAR 52.222-3 Convict Labor; FAR 52.222-19 Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies; FAR 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity Employment; FAR 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; FAR 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons; FAR 52.223-18 Encouraging Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving; FAR 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases; FAR 52.225-25 Prohibitions on Contracting with Entities Engaging in Certain Activities or Transactions Relating to Iran-Reps and Certs; FAR 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration; FAR 52.233-3 Protest After Award; FAR 52.233-4 Applicable Law for Breach of Contract; FAR 52.252-1 Solicitations Provisions Incorporated by Reference; FAR 52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated by Reference.</p>

Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item â€“
(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is â€“
(i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at FAR 2.101);
(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
(iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without
modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and

App. 1702), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.
Component means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into an end product.
Cost of components means â€“
(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation
costs to the place of incorporation into the end product (whether or not such costs are paid to a
domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or
(2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of
the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus
allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs

the Buy American Act is waived for an end product that is a COTS item (See 12.505(a)(1)).
(c) Offerors may obtain from the Contracting Officer a list of foreign articles that the Contracting
Officer will treat as domestic for this contract.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The West Texas VA Health Care System (WTVAHCS) located in Big Spring, Texas, has a requirement for Document Destruction Services.  The acquisition will be accomplished using procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561990.  This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  Please see Request for Quotation VA257-17-Q-1487 for information on how to submit a Quote for consideration.

DISCLAIMER

All information received in response to this Notice that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this Notice.

SCOPE:

The WTVAHCS requires a vendor to provide all labor, equipment, supplies, secured vehicles, materials, supervision and other related services necessary to provide sensitive document, film, optical, digital, and electronic destruction services for the WTVAHCS.  Contractor shall destroy documents completely to preclude recognition or reconstruction of the information in accordance with procedures in VA Handbook 6300.1, Records Management Procedures, VA Directive 6371, Destruction of Temporary Paper Records, VA Handbook 6500, Information Security Program, VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitation, VA Handbook 6500.6, Contract Security, and NIST SP 800-88 Revision1, Guidelines for Media Sanitation.  Methods and equipment used to routinely destroy classified or confidential information include burning, pulping, shredding, macerating, or otherwise definitely destroy the information contained in the temporary paper records so that it is not readable or reconstructable to any degree.  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards must be used if shredding is the form of final destruction.  Contractor shall be responsible for management, oversight, security, and control of all documents containing VA sensitive information documents or Protected Health Information (PHI) stored in the locked containers, prior to and until final destruction.  The Contractor must be certified by the National Association for Information Destruction, Inc (NAID).  The Contractor is subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), 45 CFR 164.502(e) and regulations enacted under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to review the requirements of HIPAA and HITECH, information about which may be found on the internet at the following address: http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/index.html.  The Contractor shall indicate its understanding and agreement that property obtained under this contract may contain records previously maintained as a system of records subject to the Privacy Act.  The Contractor is therefore also subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act and is responsible for compliance with its provisions with respect to the handling and disposal of protected information.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION; A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND QUOTATIONS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with LKC Technologies Incorporated to purchase a UTAS Visual Electrodiagnostic System (VES) equipped with BigShot Ganzfeld stimulator to support the Comparative Medicine Branch (CMB) and the Signal Transduction Laboratory (STL). This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The FAR as supplemented by the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) will be used to evaluate the quote and award this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334516 "Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing" and has a size standard of 1,000 employees.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mission of the NIEHS is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. The Branches &amp; Laboratories at NIEHS fall under the Intramural Research and the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Divisions. The CMB ensures the judicious and humane use of rodents for biomedical research that benefits human and animal health and the overall goal of the STL is to define the mechanisms that cells, tissues and organisms use to respond to physiological and environmental stimuli. The CMB and STL need a VES with testing capabilities and protocols that can perform beyond the capabilities of an Electroretinogram (ERG) (i.e. more than retinal function evaluation in mice). The system will be used to perform electrodiagnostic evaluations of visual functions in mice. In addition, the VES will help provide specific data about the location and underlying causative factors of abnormalities that routine diagnostic tests cannot differentiate. The UTAS VES equipped with BigShot Ganzfeld Stimulator offers a unique set of testing capabilities and protocols (i.e. comprises several technologies which record electrical potentials from the surface of the eyes to provide objective indications of the function of various parts of the visual system) that are not available on any other commercially available system. The UTAS VES equipped with BigShot Ganzfeld stimulator offers the capabilities and features described in Attachment I - Statement of Work (SOW).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION; A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND QUOTATIONS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Fisher Scientific (part of Thermo Fisher Scientific) to purchase a QuantStudio 6 flex real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) system to support the Neuropharmacology section of the Neurobiology Laboratory. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.

<p>The mission of the NIEHS is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. Neurobiology is an integral part of environmental health sciences. Disruption of brain development and function produces life-long effects on human cognitive potential. The Neurobiology Laboratory investigates the cellular and molecular processes in the developing and aging nervous system that increase its vulnerability to environmental toxicants. The Neuropharmacology section of the Neurobiology Laboratory is in need of a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) system with interchangeable sample holders (i.e., 96-well, 96-well Fast and 384 well plates formats) for an ongoing study on the role of brain neuroimmune function in inflammation-related Neurodeqeneration. The lab needs a new PCR system that is compatible with current reagents and supplies used in lab as different calibration data can affect the analysis results of ongoing experiments. Each experiment file stores the calibration data from the instrument it was run on. In addition, changes to sequencing kits, protocols and instrument firmware can affect the base composition of sequencing data. Moreover, bias is known to vary between laboratories, from run to run or even from lane to lane on the same flowcell. Such variability and instability in the system confound comparative studies and render systematic bias investigations difficult. The lab has used Taqman assays with target primers and sequence specific probes for greater than 10 years using the predecessors to the QuantStudio. The QuantStudio 6 flex real-time PCR system will allow for continued use of these assays and supplies without having to optimize new protocols and procedures with a different machine. This allows for continuity of research progress in the lab. The Quantstudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System must offer the capabilities and features described in Attachment I - Statement of Work (SOW).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION; A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND QUOTATIONS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Macrogen Clinical Laboratory process and prepare whole genome sequencing of seven (7) human samples to a mean mappable coverage of 60X for the Mechanisms of Genome Dynamics Group (MGDG). This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The FAR as supplemented by the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) will be used to evaluate the quote and award this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380, "Testing Laboratories" with a size standard of $15.0M.
<p><br />The mission of the NIEHS is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. The Branches &amp; Laboratories at NIEHS fall under the Intramural Research Division (IRD) and the National Toxicology Program (NTP). The MGDG falls under the Genome Integrity &amp; Structural Biology Laboratory. Members of the Mechanisms of Genome Dynamics Group are interested in identifying the mechanisms, genetic defects, and environmental factors that lead to the extreme risks of genome instability. The outcomes of their work encompass areas of DNA replication and various DNA repair pathways. Methodology includes the state of the art yeast experimental models, as well as sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of yeast and human genomes, turning them into reporters of genome instability. The MGDG has a need for continued support on an ongoing research project on whole genome sequencing of seven (7) human samples to a mean mappable coverage of 60X. Sequencing data provides vital information to ongoing investigations regarding environmental disease mechanisms and the genetic, genomic, and epigenomic components of susceptibility, outcomes and progression of environmental diseases. In order to maintain the integrity of current research projects and research data continuity it is imperative that additional sequencing be provided using the same technology currently in use. Macrogen Clinical Laboratory is currently performing whole-genome sequencing of MGDG's materials under the ongoing study. All of MGDG's current analytical pipelines have been designed and optimized to operate with the sequencing data produced by Macrogen, As such, continued use of Macrogen for whole-genome sequencing is required to meet research standards and to produce data compatible by platform and format with already accumulated whole-genome sequencing data. The Contractor shall perform the tasks described in Attachment I - Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
