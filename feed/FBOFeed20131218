<SUBJECT>Innovative Cross-Domain Cyber Reactive Information Sharing (ICCyRIS)
<SOLNBR>BAA-RIK-14-02
<CONTACT>Gail E. Marsh, Contracting Officer, Phone 315-330-7518, Email Gail.Marsh@us.af.mil
<DESC><p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Cross Domain Innovation &amp; Science (CDIS) group of the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate is interested in new innovative technologies and capabilities, within the Multi-Level Security (MLS) and Cyber Security environments, that promote the state of the art for secure, accreditable resilient and reactive capabilities to enhance the sharing of information between multiple security domains within both enterprise and mobile/tactical environments.</p>
<p>This BAA focuses on developing new technologies to allow secure data sharing; trusted computing; smart routing; cyber defense; Multi-Level Security (MLS) trust at the tactical edge; and a comprehensive, multi-security domain, user-defined operational picture to effectively and efficiently improve the state-of-the-art for defense enterprise, cloud, and mobile/tactical computing/operations.</p>
<p>The goals of this BAA are to improve cross-domain information sharing in five distinct technology areas:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Multi-Enclave/Multi-Domain Cyber User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) - Extending enterprise status monitoring efforts and Cross Domain Solutions (CDSs) adaptability to meet greater operator need.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. High Risk Data Type Mitigation - Providing micro-virtualized ultra-high-risk content and investigations for malicious behavior before passing them to other security domains.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Fine-Grained Grammar for Orchestration - Use of formal grammars for quick adaptation of workflows to meet changing mission/security/performance requirements.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Content and Label Based Routing - Extending the trust provided at node and network environments to the information objects being passed to assure end-to-end trust in passing and delivering information to recipients.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. MLS Trust at the Edge - Extending the robustness and usability of MLS mobile and desktop endpoint technology to meet the critical needs of our mobile warriors.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Focus Areas Applicable to all FYs</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Incorporate Enterprise Security Features into Mobile/Tactical Systems<br /></span></strong>Given the expanding scope of threat to operational systems and networks, investigate and develop high assurance hardware features available in Enterprise environments for use within the mobile/tactical environments. Examples (not specific requirements) include but are not limited to Trusted Platform Module (TPM)/Secure Boot, Trusted Network Connect (TNC), and various x86/64 architecture security enhancements like VT-d/VT-x/ASLR/etc.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Automatically Evaluate Video Streams for Cross-Domain Releasability<br /></span></strong>Perform an analysis of alternatives and incorporate the most mature systems into a prototype for evaluating the releasability of streaming data. This specifically includes but is not limited to speech-to-text, person recognition, and object recognition functionality plus system(s) to reason over the results of these functions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Improved Security Through Virtualization<br /></span></strong>Utilize the broad swath of virtualization technologies to improve the state of the art of information assurance. Note also the related High Risk Binary Assessment Focus Area for FY 15 under this BAA, as well as the Secure Data Containers Focus Area for FY16.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Novel, Trustworthy Filtration<br /></span></strong>Improve the state of data filtration through the use of techniques and procedures either previously unexplored in filtration or completely novel. Note that adding a new filter for an already covered file type is much less interesting than the ability to add classes of file types which are otherwise unaddressed by filtration engines. Note also the related High Risk Binary Assessment Focus Area for FY15 under this BAA, as well as the Imagery to Text Focus Area for FY18.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Improved Orchestration Interfaces that don't require a "Man-in-the-Loop"<br /></span></strong>Research and develop better automation of multiple data flows, each containing myriad functions and decision points, intended to affect large pools of data. This may be used in conjunction with various efforts such as the National Security Agency's (NSA's) Bray tool, Data Flow Configuration Format (DFCF), Guard Remote Management Protocol (GRMP), the CDS Management Information Base (MIB), and/or others. This capability includes the ability to demonstrate proposed changes against known pools of data, provide high level metrics regarding the original and changed results on those known pools of data, and to allow the user to drill down into greater, granular detail on the metrics as needed. These interfaces should not assume any particular degree of knowledge for users beyond a general computer use competency, and must ensure users' identity and authorization via appropriate methods.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Improved Machine-to-Machine Automation<br /></span></strong>Many cross domain links are established between automated systems for various purposes. There are large swaths of commonality across most of these links. Build tools to leverage unmodified CDSs from the Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) baseline to better meet the need for creating similar links in the future.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Improved Commodity Multi-Level Security (MLS) Networking<br /></span></strong>Create networking capable of mandatory access control (MAC) for content, locations and users marked, approved and operating at different levels of classification (plus releasability, caveats, and other security-relevant markings) utilizing commodity hardware, operating systems, software and infrastructure as much as practical. Complete redevelopment/replacement of existing networking infrastructure and endpoints is explicitly outside the scope of this effort.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Areas for FY15:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">High Risk Binary Assessment<br /></span></strong>Demonstrate a capability to automate invocation of potentially malicious content within a secure environment (such as a sandbox, virtual machine, or &lsquo;detonation chamber'). This capability should include scripting some appropriate number of user actions within commodity, unmodified applications and monitoring the environment for malicious or unexpected behaviors. The solution should incorporate both signature based detection of suspect behaviors as well as aberrant behavior based on a learned fingerprint of the normal functioning of the consuming application(s) within the environment. For example, if a given application doesn't normally generate alternate data streams within Windows, then generating an alternate data steam upon opening a new file in that application should be flagged. Integrity of the mechanisms that identify these unexpected behaviors must be protected from tampering or observation from within the secure environment. The solution shall also include one or more ways to adapt to new exercising applications and steps within the secure environment to either extend inspection of current file types supported and/or to offer support for new file types. In the final version delivered, no particular degree of knowledge beyond a general computer use competency should be expected from operators or those who adapt the system in the aforementioned manner(s).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Situational Awareness of End-to-End Multi-level Information Flow<br /></span></strong>NSA's Cross Domain Solution Management Information Base (CDS-MIB) is a CDS-independent mechanism used to report including flow performance, errors, and other various metrics related to CDS health and status. This is only part of the picture that is necessary to efficiently be aware of the true multi-level information flow picture. The addition of information pertaining to CDS support devices such as external filtering appliances, CDS pre-processors, mission applications that leverage CDS and other IT integral to cross domain services (e.g., identity management, email infrastructure) is intended to enhance end-to-end situational awareness. This will increase situation awareness of all CDSs on the network, provide more insight into network status and services status, and provide opportunity for further integration with other activities, to include prior CDIS run efforts such as Audit-Based Sensing &amp; Protection (ASP) and Behavior Based Risk Assurance (BBRA). Once this capability is developed, other capabilities can use the information to include load balancers and automatic failover.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CAC Authentication via MicroSD Certificate Storage<br /></span></strong>Commercial mobile devices on their own, with standard configuration, are not secure enough for government use. However, to save money, many agencies are looking to leverage them. This poses a challenge for securing government/sensitive data access by the device user, while maintaining all the functionality of the commercial device itself. One approach is to utilize micro/nano Secure Digital (SD) cards to provide secure storage of access certificates. Phase one of this focus area will develop a secure, "read only" certificate store utilizing the Micro and Nano SD card form factors for use in physically unmodified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Mobile Platforms. Software applications may be modified or created in order to demonstrate the functionality. The second phase of this focus area will test the proposed solution against real world scenarios utilizing life-like certificate data to ascertain robustness against published Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGS).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Securing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Mobile Device Common Access Card (CAC) Authentication via Near-Field Communication (NFC)<br /></span></strong>Several COTS mobile devices feature NFC capabilities. Concurrently, there are requirements for warfighters to authenticate on computing resources with their Common Access Card (CAC). Unfortunately, physical external readers for CACs are unwieldy extensions to mobile devices. As such, there may be an opportunity to investigate utilizing the COTS NFC capabilities assuming they meet or exceed the security requirements accomplished by the physical readers. Given the repeated demonstrations given at most modern Black Hat events exploiting COTS NFC capabilities in many various ways, skepticism as to these devices' security capabilities will need to be assuaged and demonstrated as mitigated appropriately for operationally meaningful situations. Additionally, the demonstrated solution has additional challenges: It must be able to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data provided via CAC PKI capabilities, it must securely account for users with multiple credentials and access their existing certificates within appropriate networks (as in Global Access List, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)/ Active Directory (AD), etc.), must have a segregation capability if malicious code is detected, and allow for appropriate persistence of user authentication even after the device and NFC tag are outside of scanning range.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Areas for FY 16: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secure Data Containers<br /></span></strong>Create and demonstrate a method to generate, secure and safely destroy three or more secure data containers (SDCs) within recent versions of the Android mobile operating system (OS) running on unmodified COTS hardware. These SDCs are required to hold application data so that other applications or instances of the same applications cannot access sensitive or proprietary information that resides elsewhere on a mobile device. They must be application agnostic; however, they must also be able to hold the applications data securely. Use of commercial applications on these devices with a degree of trust will require the application runtime in the mobile OS to provide appropriate separation from the rest of the trusted environment. This will require assurance of robust segregation as well as dynamic, configurable control of Android's "app intents" within single SDCs as well as across multiple SDCs on a single mobile device. Additionally, as current configurations of Android OS allow for multiple calls among applications without user intervention (e.g., photo app calls camera, Global Positioning System (GPS), location service, etc.). As such, SDCs must also allow multiple instantiations of an application (i.e., navigation, email, etc.) within one or more individual domains on a mobile device without violating the integrity of those individual containers. These SDCs must have a periodic capability to test their integrity, as well as assuring no data path exists between containers which are not explicitly permitted, no communication between instances of the same application across SDCs, be able to support dynamic application/sensor calls with negligible performance degradation, and assure apps are confined to their specified SDC.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adaptive Filter Workflows<br /></span></strong>Prototype a solution that augments existing Cross Domain Solution (CDS) orchestration grammars to address relative confidence in filters within each given data flow. This explicitly includes both deterministic and heuristic filtration tools, as well as the confidence in a given tool's capability in a given role. Binary (go/no-go) decisions are based on filter inputs to handle probabilistic determination based on a &lsquo;building confidence' model. This requires the generation of a generalized list of &lsquo;cases' for decision over as well as the creation of a secure decision algorithm. The prototype is expected to demonstrate its capability over multiple filter and file types. In the final deliverable, filter types must include multiple (4+) different degrees of trust in their function/capability as well as both deterministic and heuristic filtration tools. Work flows orchestrated by the demonstration must be nontrivial, including the ability to transform files between different formats as well as both detecting and reacting to failure of transfer. Additionally the final capability must be able to handle multiple (&gt;5) distinct file types appropriately.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cross Domain Solution (CDS) Load Balancing and Failover<br /></span></strong>In order to support the Department of Defense (DoD) Enterprise's 24x7 operational requirements, CDSs will need to be able to support load balancing and failover. CDSs are not uniform, as different types handle different protocols and data formats in different ways, often with security relevant implications and always affecting acceptable load balancing or failover processes. The first phase of this research is the development of CDS-agnostic best practices for the load balancing and failover handling for CDSs. Due to the proprietary nature of some CDSs, this would require some standardization or a least common denominator approach on the part of the load balancing solution. Research aligned to this effort includes the load balancing communication by which system status is tracked and work is distributed. Examples of available CDS sensors and communication protocols include CDS Management Information Base (MIB), the Guard Remote Management Protocol (GRMP), and numerous others. Off-The-Shelf (OTS) solutions should be investigated to be leveraged or integrated. For the second phase, develop a means for implementing solutions to complex use cases with consideration to available, deployed guards. Design and implement a test procedure to validate the viability of the technology. Security and transition readiness are top priorities during this phase of development and integration.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mobile Android Multi-Biometric Acquisition (MAMBA) <br /></span></strong>Develop a mobile application that fully leverages the available biometric sensors (accelerometer, GPS, camera, fingerprint reader, microphone, etc.) in current and future cellular phone and/or tablet devices and securely transmits recorded data for analysis. The first phase of this effort will create and/or integrate a prototype solution that can interface and/or integrate with a COTS mobile device, then evaluate efficacy of data and functionality of the solution in a variety of scenarios. The solution should be hardware platform independent, meaning the brand of phone or tablet used should not matter. However, the proposed solution should be built on the COTS mobile operating system Android OS at a minimum with SE Android being the preferred mobile OS. In addition, other secure mobile OSs are potentially interesting. In the second phase, conduct a field test of the solution across multiple hardware platforms recording and transmitting a variety of biometric data points. These tests will be conducted to evaluate the ability of prototype to interface with existing, live AF or equivalent data repositories. Collected data may be enhanced as necessary to proper robustness for identification purposes with a maximum false-positive rate of 0.1%.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Areas for FY 17:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On-Demand Cross Domain Solution (CDS) Filtering<br /></span></strong>Provide a trustworthy mechanism to securely store, deliver, and deploy new filters into CDSs on demand. The intent is to develop a new or extend an existing agnostic Application Programmer's Interface (API) to allow multiple disparate transfer CDSs to interrogate one or more trusted store(s) for filters to be secure delivered in near-real-time, and to provide a reference implementation for that trusted store. This is intended to allow CDSs to adapt to changing workload requirements and threat environments. If the CDS already contains a similar capability or partial capability, it is expected that this API will wrapper them rather than redeveloping.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enhance Logic and Visualization for Enterprise Capabilities <br /></span></strong>Extend the ability to monitor one or more transfer Cross Domain Solutions (CDSs) beyond prior efforts' scope by incorporating business logic through a reasoning engine to examine the data collected and stored via CDS-MIB, SNMP &amp; perhaps alternate sources as well as performing trend analysis across this information. This would be expected to be able to automatically suggest and/or enforce reporting and warning thresholds to alert responsible parties via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) (for integration with enterprise management &amp; alert systems), email and/or text to abnormal activity with respect to the CDSs' normal functioning. Given other previously developed tools, this developed capability might be expected to automatically react to incoming data and alter one or more CDSs' operational posture, either to ensure operational goals and/or reduce data exfiltration/malware infiltration.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mobile MLS Cross Domain XML Routing<br /></span></strong>Evaluate existing XML data tagging standards for use in both IP-based wired networks and wireless mobile networking environments, both for traditional tagging roles and also in support of cross security domain routing decisions. Publish this evaluation in order to gather feedback and consensus and hopefully drive standardization across DoD/IC and eventually the mobile industry. Finally, develop a prototype that enables standardized cross domain routing originating and/or ending on a mobile platform.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advanced File Typing<br /></span></strong>Perform best of breed Analysis of Alternatives between deep content inspection and/or file parsing capabilities such as Apache Tika, Data Format Description Language (DFDL), and similar. Using the best of breed, create a prototype to perform deep content inspection of files to detect and/or extract metadata, binary blobs and/or structured text content to properly &amp; fully identify file types (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) types). Develop with common programmatic API calls plus appropriate web service interfaces and NSA's Filter Componentization Effort (FCE) specification. Test and evaluate performance and reliability of file type identification. Include edge cases such as polymorphism, spoofing, multiple file type compatibilities, and container file types.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Areas for FY 18:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Imagery to Text<br /></span></strong>In order to better meet warfighter operational needs, perform an Analysis of Alternatives on commercial, open source and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) tools which provide Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and related capabilities. Include analysis on cost, performance, hardware requirements, accuracy (false positive / false negative rates), and other relevant features. Use the highest rated alternative to generate raw text files from multiple (3+) disparate imagery file and/or streaming formats. Create interfaces to feed output to other processes such as the Filter Componentization Effort (FCE) specification among other relevant specifications. Ensure the product provides appropriate levels of auditing and meets relevant assurance requirements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Kane<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 315-330-2324 0730-1630 Monday-Friday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 315-330-2961 Evenings and Weekends<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Email: <a href="mailto:Robert.Kane.7@us.af.mil">Robert.Kane.7@us.af.mil</a></p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) <strong>Overall Scientific and Technical Merit</strong> -- Including the degree of innovation for the approach and the use of innovative modern architectures in development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology; the use of analysis, metrics &amp; testing and adherence to Information Assurance and Cross-Domain best practices, (2) <strong>Related Experience</strong> - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge and experience within cross-domain environments, (3) <strong>Openness, Maturity &amp; Assurance of Solution</strong> - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of degree of Information Assurance and Cross-Domain standards implemented, and (4) <strong>Reasonableness and Realism</strong> of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><br />VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</span>:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Secret or Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Secret or Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207 (c) (15) (ii); all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Qualification Requirements:  Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to Patrick McGowan at (405) 734-8120; fax (405) 734-8129, or e-mail patrick.mcgowan@tinker.af.mil

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br />TO: ALL Potential Respondents</p>
<p><br />13 Dec 2013</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Notice regarding Request for Information for Air Force Satellite Control Network Commercial Provisioning Draft Performance Work Statement for Development Planning Directorate (SMC/XRD)</p>
<p>Request for Information</p>
<p>The Air Force Satellite Control Network is part of Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) satellite operations architecture. The AFSCN provides satellite communications support to National Security Space users using world-wide antenna network. The AFSCN's primary missions include tracking, telemetry and commanding (TT&amp;C), ranging, anomaly resolution, and launch support.</p>
<p>Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Development Planning Directorate (XR) is investigating commercial TT&amp;C service providers. The goal is to understand how a commercial TT&amp;C service provider might be used to reduce AFSCN Operations, Maintenance and Sustainment (OM&amp;S) costs while continuing to support certain AFSPC satellite operational needs.</p>
<p>A future architecture concept would likely include a mix of AFSCN and commercial systems. It's desired that this future architecture could be implemented in the near term (2 to 5 years).</p>
<p>The Government has included a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for industry review. It is our intent to use the PWS to describe a concept development study for commercial provisioning and associated pricing agreement estimate. Our desire is to award 2 or 3 study contracts, of 3 month duration and government provided funding between $400K - $600K total (approximately $200K per study). We are interested in your comments and feedback regarding the feasibility of the current scope, schedule, and funding level of the project.</p>
<p>The Government does not presently intend to award a contract based on this draft PWS,<br />but wants to obtain study feedback regarding scope, schedule, technical maturity, and study costs for planning purposes.</p>
<p>Response Information</p>
<p><br />This RFI is being conducted for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a request for proposal or a request for quote. Information contained in this RFI is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision and is not<br /><br />binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with a submission in response. The information received will be considered for the purposes of market research.</p>
<p>This RFI is unrestricted and encourages responses from all responsible contractors independent of size. Additionally, responses from small business and small disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, Veteran-owned, WOSB, HUBZONE , historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions. Small businesses are encouraged to form teaming arrangements. Please identify if teaming would be contemplated to meet this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517410 - Satellite Telecommunications. The Applicable Classification Code is "D - Automatic Data Processing and Telecommunication Services". The small business size standard is $30 Million. Responses are due no later than (NLT) Thursday, 16 Jan 2014. Responses should be submitted electronically to Ms. Tiffany Trotter and Lt Christopher Petrik.</p>
<p>Information submitted in response to this RFI will enhance the Government's ability to acquire quality systems in the future and, therefore, will be used for planning purposes only. All material provided in response to this RFI shall be unclassified, non-confidential, and non- proprietary to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>Interested sources providing confidential/proprietary information in response to this RFI shall separately and clearly identify and mark all confidential/proprietary information. The Government will take all necessary steps to protect/safeguard any confidential/proprietary information provided. The Government will NOT be responsible for any confidential/proprietary information not clearly marked.</p>
<p>All responses should be accomplished on company letterhead and limited to 5 pages. Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches, single-spaced with text no smaller than 11-point font size, Times New Roman. Margins shall be one-inch on all sides.</p>
<p>Any questions or technical inquiries should be submitted electronically to Lt. Christopher Petrik (Project Officer), including a cc copy to Ms. Tiffany Trotter. Company proprietary material should be properly marked.</p>
<p>SMC/XR plans to create a small team to review RFI responses. The government led team will include Aerospace (FFRDC) and System Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contractors assigned to AFSPC, SMC, 50 SW and AFSCN user satellite representatives. The RFI team will sign government Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA). If your RFI response requires you have a NDA from any of the review team members, please contact Ms Tiffany Trotter via email by 6 Jan 2014.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS This procurement is being solicited, offered, evaluated, and awarded using procedures in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test program for Certain Commercial Items, along with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.2 and 12.6, and the procedures in FAR Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation, A13PS00089 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The North American Industry classification (NAICS) code is 541519, Other Computer Related Services, and the business size maximum is $25.5 Million. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through FAC 2005-66. The contemplated contract is a total set-aside for Buy Indian under the authority of 25 USC 47. All Buy Indian concerns shall provide a breakdown of pricing to demonstrate that at least 51% of contract performance shall be performed and incurred by the prime.  All responsible Buy Indian sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the Government. This acquisition is 100% set aside for Buy Indian. Economic enterprises that are not at least fifty one percent owned by a Native American or Alaskan Native may not offer quotes in response to this notice and any quotes submitted by other than Indian owned businesses shall not be considered. Quoters shall certify that they are Indian owned. 
The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire Risk Management Framework (RMF) support for applying the RMF in support of Department of Interior (DOI) information systems, as outlined in the Statement of Work.  The RMF process includes activities related to security categorization, security control selection and implementation, security control assessment, information system authorization, and security control monitoring. BIA will award based upon Best Value methodology using the following evaluation factors.  For this requirement, all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are more significantly important than cost or price.  The importance of price as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality of technical quotations received in relation to the other evaluation factors. When technical capability tends to move toward equality, the significance of price increases, or when price is significantly high as to diminish the value of an otherwise technically superior quotation.  The evaluation criteria are as follows:
1)	Technical Approach. 2)	Key Personnel. 3)	Past Performance. 4)	Price.
BIA contemplates a Time & Materials contract with a twelve month base period and four (4) twelve month option periods.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Parata Systems, LLC 2600 Meridian Parkway, Durham, NC, 27713-2203, as the only responsible source that can provide a lease for automation systems, medication dispensing, clinical pharmacy for Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune. This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.5 Test Procedures for Commercial Items. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24 are incorporated.
<p>Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune has a requirement for a lease of five (5) automation systems, medication dispensing, and clinical pharmacy for nine (9) months. The systems shall be capable of preparation and dispensing of medications. The system shall be able to fill, cap, sort, store, and dispense prescriptions. The system shall be able to print labels and affix them to the prescriptions. The system shall be capable of sending status messages to a secondary computer. These status messages shall include fill requests, cancel requests, script queued, script added, script completed, script incomplete, and script pick up messages. The system shall have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The system shall have a high efficiency particulate absorption (HEPA) filter and fan for maintaining the proper air conditions within the device. The system shall be compatible with the installed base of pharmacy workstations at Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune.</p>
<p>The computer terminals at the pharmacy operate of workflow software, which is vendor specific. The robotic unit, which dispenses the medication, is operated/controlled by the workflow software (i.e. software tells robot to "fill this prescription"). Vendor A's software cannot work with Vendor B's robot. Thus, the required robotic units must be compatible with the existing workstation's software system. Parata Systems, LLC is the only vendor that can provide clinical pharmacy medication dispensing automation systems that meet the requirements of government. There are no other manufacturers that can provide automation systems, medication dispensing, clinical pharmacy that meet the requirements. Only systems from Parata are capable of interfacing with the installed base of workstations at NH Camp Lejeune. If pharmacy automation systems from another manufacturer were acquired, the units would not be capable of dispensing medications, slowing the efficiency of the pharmacy, and therefore decreasing the standard of patient care. The short-term lease is a result of a temporary move of the department into a temporary structure/location, while the current pharmacy in undergoing construction. The current staff is already trained on the current system and it would be improvident to train the staff on a new, temporary system. The current pharmacy robotic systems are past their serviceable lifespan and the relocation of these systems may result in irreparable damage. After the lease has ended, the full requirement will be competed and the requirement at that time will include new workstations as part of the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number:  E14PS00011 for Proposed Research on Oil Spill Response Operations in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf
DESCRIPTION:
The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the BSEE Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR) Program on Oil Spill Response Operations in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research.  For a summary of research previously completed and recently performed, visit visit http://www.bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Oil-Spill-Response-Research/Master-List-of-Oil-Spill-Response-Research.aspx.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.
BACKGROUND:   
The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR) Program is requesting White Papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. After review by BSEE, authors of selected White Papers will be requested to submit full proposals for further consideration.  Proposals selected for funding by BSEE shall receive funding via FY 2014 allocations. The BSEE anticipates that $7,000,000 may be available for the initiation of new research and/or studies addressing topics identified through this announcement.  The BSEE does not anticipate any one award exceeding $900,000.  NOTICE:  The BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify the BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared outside of BSEE. The BSEE anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis.   
OBJECTIVES: Responses to the FY 2014 OSRR projects under this announcement should be limited to the following topics: 
1. Catalog OSRR Funded Research Recommendations and Key Findings that may have an Impact on BSEE Regulations. 
Produce a summary report of research performed under the BSEE OSRR. The study will review OSRR deliverables produced since 1997 to summarize their work, accomplishments, findings, and future research recommendations. To maximize the value of the results, the findings and recommendations will be input into a searchable database utilizing a subject matter title methodology that will allow users easy and accurate access to obtain the necessary information.
2. Scientifically Based Planning Standards for Dispersant Effectiveness and Usage Rates. 
Develop best practices and planning standards which can be used to predict the effectiveness of surface and subsea dispersant use in various types of environmental conditions.  Additionally, develop a method that evaluates and predicts the best usage rates for these environmental conditions. Reference 30 CFR 254.27 for current requirements.   3. Scientifically Based Planning Standards for Burn Boom Effectiveness and Usage Rates. 
Develop planning standards for the amount of oils in various weather conditions that could be contained and burned. Standards should include a discussion of various products available and the burn rate or degradation rate of various burn booms. Reference 30 CFR 254.28 for current requirements. 
4. Oil Spill Detection and Analysis Using Remote Sensing Technologies.  
Perform an independent assessment of the various oil spill detection systems available for offshore oil and gas operations. The assessment shall identify what systems are available or being developed, the potential they have to improve notification of a spill and the resulting response operations, and any limitations they may have. Additionally, the study shall include an assessment of the current mounting and delivery options available for identified sensor packages. For all practical configurations, please discuss areas of potential improvement, level of human involvement needed to successfully operate, and potential costs associate with the hardware and operations.
5. Subsea Oil Spill Detection Sensors.  
Investigate and develop sensor technologies which could be used to detect oil leaks in a subsea environment. Leak scenarios may include abandoned wells, pipeline leaks, subsea leaks during drilling operations, and leaks from subsea production facilities. 
6. Mechanical Recovery Capability of Chemically Treated Oil. 
Investigate the capability of various skimming devices to recover non-dispersed oil which has been in contact with chemical response tools but have not dispersed. Determine if subsea dispersant applications has any impact on the mechanical response to any resulting surface slick.
7. Solidifying the Scientific Capabilities of Ohmsett  Quantifying Mixing Energy.
Determine a scientifically sound method to quantify the mixing energy in the tank due to wave conditions typically used under normal test conditions.  Mixing energy is a key parameter which is quantified in small and intermediate scale testing such as EPAs baffled flask test. Quantifying such a measurement would allow one to bridge across scales, and to address issues associated with scaling-up. Wave types may include sine waves, breaking waves, open ocean conditions, and others as determined to be appropriate.
8. Solidifying the Scientific Capabilities of Ohmsett  Effect of Ambient Chemical Levels. 
The water of the Ohmsett test tank has chemical levels different than that found in the waters of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (Gulf of Mexico, Pacific, and Arctic). Some of these are required to maintain a clean test environment or to reduce corrosion; others may be a by-product of testing activities. Identify these differences and determine the effect they may have on dispersant effectiveness testing and how this may affect scaling from the EPAs Baffled Flask Test which uses synthetic sea water.
9. Development of Smart Skimming Technologies. a) Develop technology packages to aid in the automation and optimization of oil skimmer performance. Technologies should aim to ultimately remove the skimmer operator entirely in order to maximize and normalize oil recovery efforts and results. Areas of investigation should include oil thickness measurement devices that can independently control skimmer operation to meet encountered oil thickness demands without operator input. Thickness measurement devices can use any kind of practical technology and ideally be able to retrofit to at least one type of commercial skimmer. b) Develop technology packages for real-time measurement of oil and water recovery, real-time calculation and reporting of recovery efficiency. Technologies should aim to retrofit to existing commercial skimmers but not hinder flow rate. 
c) Develop novel power generation technology to use recovered oil from onboard storage of either skimmer or vessel of opportunity. Power generation should be readily adaptable for electric, mechanical, pneumatic and/or hydraulic outputs.
d) Development of other innovative technologies that could lead to automation and optimization of oil skimmer performance.
10. Establishment of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) definitions for Oil Spill Response Equipment.
Development of TRLs began in the mid to late 1970s at NASA as a way to assess different technologies to be incorporated into flight hardware. Since the development of early TRL models, many government and commercial entities have developed similar scales, for example the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the American Petroleum Institute (API). Establish TRL definitions for typical oil spill response technology and a process to measure and quantify a technologys TRL.
HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Acquisition Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Ms. Herma J.

<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 1-3-14.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Small Business size standard is 750 employees. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Approved source is: Condor Pacific Industries.</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Various increments solicited:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>44-66, 67-88, 89-110, 111-132, 133-154, 155-176</p>

<DESC>It is the intent of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to issue a sole source solicitation to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (Raytheon), 225 Presidential Way, Woburn, MA, 01801-1060, to manufacture and deliver the following hardware related to the AN/TPY-2 radar: one Cooling Equipment Unit (CEU) with spares, one Electronic Equipment Unit (EEU) with spares, and additional radar fleet initial spares. Delivery requirements are not later than 2QFY16.<br /><br />
<p>The proposed contract modification will be executed on a sole source basis to Raytheon IDS pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), as the resulting contract modification is for highly specialized supplies and services where it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements. To date, Raytheon has developed and manufactured eight AN/TPY-2 radars (with four more domestic radars and two foreign military sales radars currently in production) as: primary subcontractor for radar production on the THAAD Development Contract (DASG60-00-C-0072); prime sole-source contractor on the BMDS Radar Contract (HQ0006-03-C-0047); prime sole-source contractor on the AN/TPY-2 Radar Production Contract (HQ0147-12-C-0006); and prime sole-source contractor on the United Arab Emirates Foreign Military Sales AN/TPY-2 Radar Contract (HQ0147-12-C-0005). No other company has manufactured the AN/TPY-2 radar or integrated the radar for operations in either the forward-based or THAAD weapon system configurations. Award to any source other than Raytheon would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the MDA's delivery requirements.</p>
<p>Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities may contact the Raytheon Contract Manager, Ms. Ursula Resendes, at 339-645-8969. Point of contact for the MDA is Mr. Ritchie Vinson, Procuring Contracting Officer, at 256-450-4794.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Spectra-Physics, of Santa Clara, California, for the purchase of an EXCEL-532-300-CDRH laser and controller under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(1)(b).
<p>NIST has a requirement for a Spectra-Physics EXCEL-532-300-CDRH laser and controller to be used in a direct one-to-one replacement of the laser currently being utilized in its customized Raman spectrometer/environmental transmission electron microscope system.</p>
<p>NIST's PML currently utilizes a Spectra-Physics EXCEL-532-300-CDRH laser and controller as an integral component in its customized system which is comprised of a Raman spectrometer integrated with an environmental transmission electron microscope. The configuration of the system is such that the compact laser head is positioned into the correct height and position by a customized metal piece. All of the optics (mirrors, filters, beam splitter, and lenses) of the system have been designed and optimized with respect to this configuration. If the current Spectra-Physics laser were to be replaced with a different brand or type of laser, a complete redesign and realignment of the system would be necessary. Such a redesign and realignment would incur costs to the Government in terms of labor, retooling, and downtime for the system and its users.</p>
<p>Spectra-Physics is the only responsible source for the required Spectra-Physics EXCEL-532-300-CDRH laser and controller, as they are the sole distributor of Spectra-Physics products. The Spectra-Physics EXCEL-532-300-CDRH laser and controller is the only laser in the marketplace that is 100% compatible with NIST's existing custom Raman spectrometer/environmental transmission electron microscope system.</p>
<p>Spectra-Physics is the only vendor for the required laser, and no other suppliers can satisfy NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334413, and the size standard is 500.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (Eastern) on January 3, 2014. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

Potential contractors should be prepared to provide an average of 25 blends annually based on historical data, with a maximum capability to blend up to 48 engines.</p>
<p>The service shall include:</p>

This procurement is being revised to change from a FAR Part 12 commercial procurement to a non-commercial procurement. It is NAVAIR's intent to award a contract to the offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government.<br />This solicitation is unrestricted. The anticipated RFP release date has been changed from 19 December 2013 to 05 February 2014.</p>

To that end, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) EW Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) program invests in Science and Technology (S&amp;T) initiatives that will provide naval forces (including Navy and Marine Corps) with improved threat warning systems; Electronic warfare Support (ES); decoys and countermeasures against weapon tracking and guidance systems; Electronic Attack (EA) against adversary Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Electronic Protection (EP) of our own weapons and C4ISR from intentional and unintentional interference. <br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">ONR has funded related technology development under numerous programs. If Offerors are enhancing work performed under other ONR or Government projects, they must clearly identify the point of departure and what existing work will be brought forward and what new work will be performed under this BAA.<br /><br />ONR Code 312 Electronic Warfare (312EW) seeks proposals for efforts that shall develop and demonstrate technologies for the next generation systems in electronic warfare. White papers and subsequent proposals should address technology developments in one or more of the following areas: <br /><br /><span><span style="mso-prop-change: 'Paolini, Susan M CIV ONRA, BD02' 20131218T1348">Area 1</span></span>. Radio Frequency (RF) / Millimeter Wave (mmW) Electronic Warfare Subsystem Demonstrators (SSDs)<br /><br />The objective is to leverage prior investments by ONR and other Government organizations in electronic and photonic technologies, techniques, components, devices and subsystems to create subsystem demonstrators (SSDs) of advanced EW capabilities in the RF and mmW portions of the EMS. For the purposes of this BAA, an SSD will be defined as an integrated collection of components, devices and subsystems that, in conjunction with other established or developmental technologies and techniques, will demonstrate an end-to-end EW capability from the list below. Each SSD will demonstrate both the functional configuration and capability of a final EW subsystem, though not necessarily the physical configuration, packaging, or form factor. White papers and subsequent proposals will encompass not only the development of these SSDs but also a final government-witnessed demonstration in a tactically relevant real or simulated environment. In order to speed the transition of these capabilities to military (Navy, Marine Corps and Joint service) systems, Offerors are encouraged to make use of existing standards for open and modular systems that are either non-proprietary (e.g. VITA, open VPX, etc.) or to which the government has full and open rights. While each SSD description below highlights the need for reducing Size, Weight and Power (SWAP) by design, actual SWAP savings may be demonstrated through analysis rather than physical measurement. Proposals that are contingent upon ONR providing government furnished equipment, instrumentation, test facilities, or threat hardware and information for exploitation are NOT acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Offeror must also provide a list of the prior ONR and Government research efforts that will be leveraged for the proposed effort with a clear integration strategy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The number and quality of leveraged efforts will be considered as an evaluation criteria for selection. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A categorized listing of prior ONR Code 312EW funded efforts from fiscal year 2008 to 2013, including titles and points of contact is provided as Attachment 1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other sources of Government-funded technology will also be considered.

Current constraints on EW systems in these bands are the physical size and performance of the required antenna. It is not unusual for whip antennas operating at these frequencies to be many meters in length and operate at less than unity gain. It is also typical for these antennas to be omnidirectional with no ability to either concentrate radiated power on a localized target (for an EA application) or determine signal direction (for an ES application). This section of the current solicitation seeks technologies and techniques to achieve physically small antennas covering the HF and VHF with no physical dimension exceeding 1 meter (threshold) or 30 centimeters (objective). Technologies that are conducive to minimizing SWAP requirements for future tactical implementation on SWAP-constrained vehicles or platforms are desired. Technologies that are conformal to the skin of a vehicle or platform are also desirable. The antenna design shall achieve a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of better than 3:1 (threshold) or 2:1 (objective) while maximizing efficiency and gain over the full 3-300 MHz band (unity gain or better is an objective). For EA antenna designs a sustained power handling capability of greater than 100 watts (threshold) or 1 kilowatt (objective) is desired. For ES antenna designs the ability to precisely determine the direction of the detected signal is desired, as well as the ability to precisely geo-locate the signal when information from multiple antennas are networked together. <br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>

While ONR has on-going interest in wideband EA transmitter systems which operate across the breadth of the mmW spectrum, this section of the current solicitation is limited to the W-Band (75-110 GHz) frequency range. Transmitter systems (consisting of power amplifier(s), matching network, and radiating element) capable of achieving 1-4 kW or greater ERP for small decoy applications or capable of being combined to achieve 100 kW or greater ERP for large platform applications across the entire 75-110 GHz frequency range are desired. (These ERP goals are peak power levels measured at a 10% or better duty factor; higher duty factor operation is also desired but a decrease of the ERP by 6-8 dB at 100% duty factor is acceptable.) Technology solutions are permitted using vacuum components, solid-state components, or combinations of both. Proposed system concepts should include a detailed end-to-end system analysis, with such considerations as input power needs, power distribution, cooling, component placement, isolation, aperture architecture, and beam-forming. The delivered system should demonstrate the ability to project the requested ERP across the full 75-110 GHz spectral band against a far-field target in a controlled and sustained beam and be able to transmit linear and phase controlled jamming waveforms capable of preserving complex signal content and coding<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>

The maximum combination of orders is $30,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.

The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. <br><br>CONTRACT INFORMATION: HUBZone solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as "Offerors") may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select no more than five (5) of the Offerors to compete in Phase 2.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than five (5) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <br><br>The following evaluation (rating) criteria listed below shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals:<br><br> 	Phase 1 - VOLUME 1: Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach   <br><br>	Phase 2 - Volume 2: Design Technical; Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Small Business Participation.

Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due no later than 09/21/2012 (30 - 45 days from issuance of the solicitation).

There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this  MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition.  Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded.  If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.  Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation.    <br><br>The total estimated contract capacity is $63,960,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  <br><br>The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening. This solicitation is set-aside for competitive HUBZone businesses only.  Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and not a debarred Contractor in order to be considered for a Government award contract. <br><br><br>

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought Notice/Request for Information (RFI) Synopsis and is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify sources that meet Air Force requirements. There will be no reimbursement for the any information provided to the Air Force. <br />Responses to this Sources Sought announcement are voluntary, and therefore, the U.S. Government is not liable to pay or reimburse any contractors which respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement are solely the responsibility of the responder. The Government does NOT intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for any information solicited herein and the Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. <br />The Air Force is issuing this repair sources sought announcement as part of a market research survey to determine if additional sources exist that could become qualified for repair of the F-16 Common Data Electronic Entry Unit (CDEEU), NSN 7025015093748, Part Number MB025A-32 and its components. Responses to this Notice shall consist of an initial white paper (not to exceed 3 pages) describing the offeror's capabilities with regard to trouble shooting, testing and repairing the F-16 CDEEU. <br />The F-16 CDEEU (MB025A-32 for F-16 blocks 40/42/50/ 52) processes data from external inputs and regulates control signals to Communication, Navigation and Identification equipment, plus display information to the Data Entry Display. The CDEEU also routes signals for up-front control of the most commonly used functions of the Communications, Navigation and IFF systems. <br />The specific parts involved are as follows: <br />CDEEU Configurations<br />FSC NIIN MMAC Part #<br />5998 015591236WF WF 29446B-01<br />5998 016238811WF WF 24008B-03<br />5998 015591237WF WF 33837A-03<br />5998 016165913WF WF 33837A-02<br />5998 015591240WF WF 24009A-01<br />5998 015591241WF WF 44630B-00<br />5998 016165912WF WF 44630A-01<br />5998 015928704WF WF 23999A-03<br />5998 016164384WF WF 23999A-02<br />5998 015593113WF WF 24011A-03
<p>Contract repair is required, and additional sources requested, for the CDEEU.

Additionally, the government does not have any special test equipment available for repair of the F-16 CDEEU. Therefore, the respondent would need to be able to demonstrate the ability to obtain or create those resources necessary to perform trouble shooting, repair and testing of the F-16 CDEEU in a timely fashion. If the offerer is able to develop or obtain the data, manuals, and tech orders from another party, they must be able to demonstrate that they have access to such resources and the legal right to use said resources to repair assets for the government.<br />Interested organizations who feel they possess the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the Government the following information: a point of contact, address, telephone, and fax numbers, email address, duns number, cage code, and/or tax ID number, as well as size category, (large, small, small disadvantaged, etc) a brief summary of the companies capabilities, description of facilities, personnel, related manufacturing experience, and existing safety approvals ( refer to the white paper listed above).<br />Provide any supporting information such as commercial literature, catalogues, manuals, etc. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must meet the criteria specified herein as well. <br />Responses to this Notice are due on or before 03 January 2014.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mission of tax collection and compliance is dependent upon the continued integrity of its IBM mainframe (Tier 1) processing environment. The purpose of this Mainframe Peripheral and Software Maintenance requirement (MP&amp;SM) is to provide: (1) on-site preventive, predictive, and on call maintenance for IBM, IBM-compatible Tier 1 peripheral devices, (2) support services, and (3) software maintenance services, software license support for Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software products as licensed for IBM mainframe computer systems. All of the aforementioned equipment, services, and software are specified in Section B.
<p>This requirement may be utilized to acquire like, similar, or related equipment for the purpose of improving system performance, satisfying increased processing workload, and generally maintaining system performance levels required by the IRS. Requirements for the purchase of equipment from the Contractor, if any, are subordinate to the primary maintenance and support services requirements acquired. Should the hardware purchase option be exercised by the IRS, specific requirements and pricing will be negotiated at the time the requirements are known. The IRS Information Technology Services (ITS) organization must approve all new equipment purchases.</p>
<p>This requirement may be utilized to acquire software license upgrades, software license conversions, and additional new software titles. Requirements for the purchase of software from the Contractor, if any, are subordinate to the primary maintenance and support services requirements acquired. Should the IRS exercise these options, specific requirements and pricing will be negotiated at the time the requirements are known. The IRS Information Technology Services (ITS) organization must approve all new software license purchases.</p>
<p>The Enterprise Computing Center - Martinsburg (ECC-MTB), and the Enterprise Computing Center - Memphis (ECC-MEM), are the two of the three major computing centers where IRS tax and administrative processing is performed. Utilizing IBM's z/OS and a variety of software provided by Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), IRS mainframe based processing occurs on six (6) IBM z/Architecture Enterprise Servers distributed across ECC-MTB and ECC-MEM. Additionally, each of the sites host IBM mainframe based security and communications hubs supporting large, high transaction volume, terminal networks.</p>
<p>The ECC-MEM plans, directs, and coordinates the analysis, design, development, testing, operation, and maintenance of automated data systems, master file, and non-master file data processing applications. One of the most dynamic operations at the ECC-MEM is on-line information processing of Currency Transaction Reports. Millions of Reports of currency transactions over $10K are filed with the Center each year. Included in the ECC-MEM communications link is the Centralized Inventory Distribution System (CIDS) project, an inventory distribution system that controls inventories and ordering services for distribution of tax and Government forms and publications to the IRS offices and the public. The ECC-MEM also maintains major segments of the Integrated Data Retrieval system (IDRS). This tax administration processing involves the posting and retrieval of transaction data for tens of millions of taxpayer accounts.</p>
<p>ECC-MTB is the central point for maintaining taxpayer account information and a broad array of interrelated files and data bases.

<DESC><strong>Type of Notice:<br /></strong>This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement. <br /><strong><br />Background:</strong><br />The mission of the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program (EBP), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is to plan and conduct studies on cancer risk associated with exposure to radiation. This work is relevant to understanding the role of radiation exposure as a cancer cause and, more generally, to understanding principles and mechanisms of carcinogenesis through epidemiological and multi-disciplinary investigations of the action of a particular carcinogen and its modification by other factors. Ionizing radiation is the best understood, and best quantified, of common human carcinogens, and this knowledge base is an enormous advantage for investigating why certain individuals, under certain circumstances or with certain characteristics, have a higher risk of developing radiation-related cancers than others.
<p>In support of this mission, Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) has collected data on cancer risk in the long-term follow up of cohorts of Japanese atomic-bomb survivors and their children (mainly in Hiroshima and Nagasaki but also in other places in Japan to which they may have migrated). Cancer cases have been identified by RERF primarily through its mortality surveillance program that covers all of Japan and its tumor registry that covers the general populations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki prefectures. Ancillary information on tumor characteristics and/or access to tissue specimens have been obtained from tissue registries in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and other sources including RERF data files and records, its autopsy series and hospital and clinic records at other institutions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Well-characterized individual radiation dose estimates from the dosimetry system, "DS02", have been made available for RERF cohort subjects, together with information on lifestyle and other cancer risk factors obtained from a series of previously conducted mail and interview surveys in the cohort population. Information desired for epidemiological studies have been obtained by conducting specially designed case-control studies, and through pathology reviews and biomedical and molecular assays of stored or fresh biological specimens.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to conduct epidemiological and multi-disciplinary studies of cancer among atomic bomb survivors. The Contractor shall collaborate with REB in their investigations of cancer risk, radiation dose, and other factors among members of the Life Span Study (LSS) and other RERF study cohort in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong><br />Major tasks of the Contractor include the following:<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Continuation of Existing Studies<br /></span><br />1. As specified by the appropriately approved protocol: (a) Ascertain cancer cases and if required by the protocol, ascertain cases with benign or pre-cancer lesions among members of the LSS cohort and other cohort samples to collect information on demographics, tumor diagnosis and treatment to be entered into databases. (b) Provide confirmation of tumor diagnosis and histological characterization of tumors. (c) Establish and maintain computer databases linking tumor information with previously conducted mail survey and other data on risk factors relevant in evaluating tumor risks. With input from the COR, design the database and provide computer programming support to implement these databases.<br /><br />2. Perform statistical analyses and prepare scientific reports to be published in peer-reviewed journals. <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Pilot Studies</span> <br /><br />1. Write protocols for the conduct of pilot studies of genomic characterization of thyroid tumors (malignant and benign) and molecular genetic characterization of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (malignant and benign) both related to radiation exposure in the LSS cohort. If found feasible, the Contractor shall collaborate with NCI in the development of protocols for the full studies. <br /><br />2. Collect small amounts of archival and/or fresh frozen tumor, non-tumor tissue samples and other samples of persons from RERF repositories or by negotiation with other institutions such as universities, hospitals, or pathology laboratories in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Perform diagnostic confirmation of the cases from which the archived tumor tissue was obtained.<br /><br />3. Prepare scientific reports based on the pilot study results for publication in peer-reviewed journals. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Full Studies<br /></span><br />1. Obtain tissue samples for use in the full-scale studies of genomic characterization of thyroid tumors (malignant and benign) and molecular genetic characterization of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (malignant and benign) related to radiation exposure in the LSS cohort. These samples will be collected from RERF repositories or by negotiation with by negotiation with other institutions such as universities, hospitals, or pathology laboratories in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br /><br />2. Collaborate with the COR in establishing diagnosis and performing laboratory assays and tests.<br /><br />3. Prepare scientific reports based on the full study results for publication in peer-reviewed journals. <br /><strong><br />Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong><br />The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is one year, with four one-year options and four options for additional quantities.<br /><br /><strong>Other Important Considerations:<br /></strong>The studies to be conducted related to the cohort require data that is only available to RERF. The cohort populations, radiation dosimetry, cancer follow-up data, risk factor information and other cohort data to which NCI seeks to access are not accessible outside RERF. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary epidemiological studies to be conducted under this contract cannot be undertaken outside the RERF cohorts. There is no reasonable alternative to contracting directly with RERF.<br /><br /><strong>Capability Statement/Information Sought:<br /></strong>We encourage all responsible sources, particularly small businesses, to submit a capability statement which will be considered by the agency. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following criteria:<br /><br />1. Documented access to this unique cohort population consisting of survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This includes having ownership and a controlling interest in all existing information on atomic bomb survivors in Japan.<br />2. Documented ability to obtain the necessary IRB approvals for the studies related to the RERF cohort.<br />3. Documented infrastructure and training to ascertain cancer cases among members of the RERF cohort.<br />4. Documented ability and experience in conducting nation-wide mortality follow-up through the Japanese family registry system, linkage to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tumor registries, and clinical follow-up by biennial health examinations.<br /><br />Interested qualified organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement, as well as the eligible small business concern's name, point of contact, address and DUNS number.<br /><br />All capability statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Jame Chang, Contract Specialist, at jame.chang@nih.gov in MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by January 2, 2014, 4:30PM, EST.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought (SBSSN) notice and is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
<p>This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The purpose of this SBSS is to identify qualified small business concerns that are interested in and capable of providing support services to 1) improve the diagnostic quality and patient experience of pediatric MRI and, 2) improve the patient safety of cardiovascular interventional procedures through the use of the radiation sparing and superior tissue visualization properties of MRI in accordance with the below information.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, with a size standard $14.0M.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the services as stated below</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.<br /> <br />Background</p>
<p>The NIH has a long history of performing integrative clinical research. The area of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) is an important focus area with multiple teams based at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). These teams span several clinical areas with interests in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary, hematological, and cardiovascular diseases. The clinical staff is complemented by engineers and physicists who are engaged in developing the next generation cardiovascular MRI.</p>
<p>An important goal is the dissemination of new diagnostic techniques and treatments developed at the NIH. The Institute is committed to seeking out patient groups that would benefit the most from such new techniques. Since CMRI can be performed without the use of ionizing radiation it has some inherent advantages for the pediatric patient population, who are especially sensitive to radiation. However, the area of pediatric CMRI has traditionally been difficult to enter for the NHLBI due to a limited opportunity for pediatric patient recruitment at the NIH. Consequently, the NHLBI has sought to form strategic partnerships with pediatric hospital centers to provide pediatric patients with access to state of the art cardiac MRI and to provide the NHLBI scientific teams with access to a broad range of problems and cases to enable further improvements of novel treatments and techniques.</p>
<p>The NHLBI has determined that the best setting for deployment and development of new techniques is a combined X-Ray MRI (XMR) suite located at a facility with a large pediatric patient volume.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a facility to accomplish the specific tasks described below.  The Contractor shall provide staffing and professional services needed to support the contract. As a part of accomplishing the specific tasks identified below, the contractor shall allow for designated NHLBI technical staff to come on-site to perform work in support of accomplishing the specific tasks described.</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks</p>
<p>1.	Provide an MRI facility to house an NHLBI provided state-of-the-art Cardiac MRI system. The MRI facility must be located adjacent to a cardiac catheterization X-ray laboratory with a convenient system for transferring patients between the two imaging systems.</p>

<DESC><p>The US General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting for its intent to lease commercial office space. The offer for the commercial space is approximately 6,223 RSF (5,168.95 to 5,713 USF) <br /><br />State: WA<br />City: Hoquiam<br />Delineated Area: City Limits of Hoquiam, WA<br />Minimum Sq. Ft.

(ABOA): 5,713<br />Space Type: Office, Office Related<br />Parking Spaces (Total): See Additional Requirements Below<br />Parking Spaces (Surface): 0<br />Parking Spaces (Structured): 0<br />Parking Spaces (Reserved): 0<br />Full Term: 20<br />Firm Term: 10<br />Option Term: 2 five year<br /><br />Additional Requirements <br /><br />The offered building space shall be/have: The location of the project may make it susceptible to flooding at or above the 100 year flood level. Under the President's Executive Order 11988, "Floodplain management", GSA is required to review the project for possible alternative solutions to the proposed Action. The No Action Alternative (Not leasing office space was considered).&nbsp; For this requirement Federal space was first considered, however the projects geographical requirements are such that Federal space will not satisfy the need. The remaining alternative considered is to temporarily lease space in an existing office space. <br /><br />In addition to geographic requirements, this project has specific mission related requirements that must be met. Those requirements are as follows:<br />&bull; All space shall be located in a Class A, modern quality office building (consistent with local market)<br />&bull; All offered space must be at or above grade<br />&bull; Contiguos space must be located all on one floor and must not be separated by common hallways or other areas<br />&bull; Offered space must not include interior ramps nor steps<br />&bull; A public or campus bus line usable by tenant occupants and their customers shall be located within the immediate vicinity or the building, but with stops not generally exceeding 800 walkable feet of the employee entrance of the building<br />&bull; The building shall have no history of prior heavy industrial use, including but not limited to large dry cleaning operations, rail yards, gas stations, or industrial facilities<br />&bull; No part of the building shall be within 500 feet of an active, freight carrying railroad truck<br />&bull; The building shall be visible or easily located from an aerterial street<br />&bull; If the building is on a high-traffic or multi-lane street, traffic signals shall be located within two blocks for safe access <br />&bull; If in a store front building, signage is required on exterior of building<br />&bull; Employees and visitors shall be able to park at reasonable rates within 800 walkable feet or the employee entrance to the offered building</p>
<p>Due to the location being within a 100 year floodplain, if any parties are knowledgeable of any other locations in this delineated area that are not located in the 100 year floodplain, that might be suitable for GSA's requirements contact Michael D. Levine - Regional Environmental Program Manager - (253) - 931-7263 or michael.levine@gsa.gov</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a Lease to an Offeror of a Building that is in compliance with the Seismic Standards. If an offer is received which is in compliance with the Seismic Standards and the other requirements of the RLP, then other offers which do not comply with the Seismic Standards will not be considered. If none of the offers is in compliance with the Seismic Standards, the LCO will make the award to the Offeror whose offer meets the other requirements of the RLP and provides the best value to the Government, taking into account price, seismic safety and any other award factors specified in the RLP.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:
<p>This is a request for information/market research to provide data for planning purposes and to gain knowledge of available products that may be of interest to the USCG. This sources sought synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.</p>
<p>The USCG, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) is conducting market research to determine manufacturers and suppliers of a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) machine shop scheduling software capable of scheduling, order processing, job changes, shop floor control, inventory management, material control, data collection, performance metrics, and job costing.</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the future acquisition is 511210 Software Publishers. The size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is $35,500,000.</p>

<p>Currently, Shop 133 utilizes multiple software applications to schedule work and track open work orders. The current applications do not provide a dynamic interface for allowing real-time information and scheduling changes, which occur daily due to an influx of priority adjustments of existing work orders as well as the impact of newly issued work orders. Additionally, the current applications lack the ability to measure the level of committed production, which is essential in developing realistic delivery dates for customers.</p>
<p>IOD is unique from most manufacturing settings as it provides specific components to its customers. In contrast to the vast majority of manufacturing industry that provides repetitive standard items. As a result, IOD needs a machine shop scheduling software to manage work from an order based perspective and not an item based perspective.</p>

Award is for a Bridge Modification to bridge the gap between the expiration of the predecessor contract and placement of a follow-on contract. The estimated award date of the follow-on is FY 2014. The award was made to the incumbent contractor Akima, Inc., that has performed the same services over the past years. The acquisition is to provide uninterrupted contractor support services to meet the operational mission of Eastern Regional Research Center&nbsp;(ERRC). Services shall be for a Three (3) month period for a Firm Fixed Price modification for extension of services, with a small IDIQ component for facilities operations, maintenance and administrative support services at the ERRC&nbsp;Pennsylvania. The Contractor is required to provide services to maintain the facility in full support of the research mission. This bridge modification will allow enough time for the long term follow-on effort for the Operations and Maintenance Services requirement to be competed.

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Agricultural Library (NAL) intends to award a sole-source contract to the American Society of Agronomy (ASA) in Fitchburg, WI, to provide electronic access via the internet for all USDA users for selected ASA-CSSA-SSSA journals. The three societies share a journal publication program. NAL requires electronic access via the internet to ASA-CSSA-SSSA journals for use by all USDA employees, authorized public on-site users, cooperators, and volunteers working on behalf of USDA and acting within the scope of their relationship with USDA during the period of performance. Access must include perpetual data rights to the content .</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 2538(1), the service needed by NAL is available from only one responsible source and no other type of service will satisfy the needs of NAL. The National Agricultural Library (NAL) is mandated (7 U.S.C. 3101) to serve as the primary agricultural information resource of the United States. One of its functions in that role is the acquisition of information in all aspects of agriculture and allied sciences. In support of this function, the NAL acquires journal publications in electronic format from publishers and makes the journals accessible to USDA employees and library patrons via the internet. In keeping with its charge to collect agricultural and related information, it seeks to maintain a collection of publications in various formats from a variety of publishers and sources. USDA researchers have demonstrated the importance of ASA-CSSA-SSSA journal content by their heavy past use of the electronic versions of the journals, made accessible by NAL's DigiTop service. NAL would like to continue to benefit from them.</p>
<p>The ASA-CSSA-SSSA is the only vendor that can meet NAL's requirement for journal access with perpetual access to the content issued during the period of performance. The ASA-CSSA-SSSA is the only copyright holder of its publications and thus is the only source of the access NAL seeks. Having perpetual access rights granted by ASA-CSSA-SSSA will give USDA users access in perpetuity to the electronic journals for which NAL purchases access. There is no source but the ASA-CSSA-SSSA for the electronic content of the subscribed publications with perpetual access rights.</p>
<p>The anticipated Period of Performance is:</p>
<p>Base Year: 01/01/2014 to 12/31/2014</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. </strong>This notice is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) intends to make a sole source award to Debtwire (Mergermarkets) for annual online subscription services as a necessary source of credit quality, debt obligation, and financial news information for the PBGC insured inventory.
<p>A subscription to Debtwire (accessed via the Internet) gives the Corporate Finance &amp; Restructuring Department (CFRD) Financial Analysts access to information that is necessary for CFRD to assess the credit quality of pension plan sponsors and assist in the decision of whether or not to terminate a pension plan. Debtwire updates financial news and debt ratings on a regular basis, as events occur that impact the credit quality of the company. There are a couple of independent research providers, including the rating agencies (Moody's and S&amp;P). What differentiates Debtwire is their intelligence on the latest advisory engagements and intercreditor negotiations. No other competitor offers that information.</p>
<p>The contract action is being sought under the FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The anticipated Period of Performance (PoP)&nbsp;is a 12-month Base Period of December 23, 2013 through December 22, 2014.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals but a Notice of Intent. No solicitation will be issued. Interested parties may, however, request further information (no later<br />than 8:00 AM Eastern Standard Time, on December 23, 2013) by email to the Contracting Officer; Teesa Roberts at roberts.teesa@pbgc.gov.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		5120-00-NIB-0111<br />Name:		Socket Set, 1/4 Drive Shallow, SAE 6 and 12 Point Fasteners, 10 Pieces<br />Description:	Premium grade 1/4 drive shallow socket set made of high-grade chrome vanadium steel. Sockets feature lobular openings for greater turning power without deforming the fastener.

<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Service Administration, Kansas City, MO.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than January 2, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), intends to negotiate a sole-source acquisition with Fitch Solutions Inc., for the Fitch Rating Services using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (FAR Part 13). Fitch Rating Service offers detailed reports and analysis about both domestic and foreign banks as well as ratings of various countries. Fitch's rating process utilizes a set of rating scales that are unique to Fitch Ratings. The Individual rating, which expresses Fitch Ratings' view of a bank's stand-alone financial profile, is combined with the Support rating to arrive at the more traditionally recognized rating from the AAA scale that is assigned to the issuer and its debt issues. Fitch Ratings' Support rating provides important insight relative to the likelihood and nature of external support should the financial institution experience financial difficulties. Ratings guidelines are applied to long and short-term foreign currency ratings; long and short-term local currency ratings; and National ratings for emerging markets (non-comparable across borders). Any responses received as a result of this notice, shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. Responses will NOT be considered as either proposals or bids. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition, based upon any written responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Other Information: Electronic submissions, in response to this Notice, shall reference CC-14-HQ-0010 and be sent to the attention of Azita Mamdouhi via e-mail to <a href="mailto:Azita.Mamdouhi@occ.treas.gov">Azita.Mamdouhi@occ.treas.gov</a>. Electronic submissions must be received no later than 10:00 AM ET, Monday,&nbsp;December 23, 2013. <br />

<DESC>NOTICE:
<p>DLA Disposition Services is pleased to announce that we are resuming our usable property sales contracting process after a brief but productive delay. During the delay, we reviewed the valuable feedback received from Industry and based on that information, we've paved the way forward for selling usable surplus property.</p>
<p>More details regarding the new process will be provided in the coming weeks, to include a revised schedule. We can share that instead of one usable property sales contract, we will have two. One contract will consist of Rolling Stock only, including such things as a variety of Trucks, Trailers and other Miscellaneous Vehicles. The other contract will include all other usable surplus property. Technically qualified firms can bid on one or both of the contracts.</p>
<p>We are planning a Pre-Proposal Conference and Site Visit that will take place in mid-January. Prior to that, we'll release two draft Requests For Technical Proposal (RFTPs) and two draft Invitations For Bid (IFBs). The proposed bidding process for both contracts will be made available at that time.</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience during the delay and look forward to your continued participation in the coming months. As always, interested parties may continue to submit questions to Becky Bellinger (Becky.Bellinger@dla.mil) or Sue Mains (Susanne.Mains@dla.mil).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Further information can also be found on our website, <a href="http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/sales/typesale.shtml">http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/sales/typesale.shtml</a></p>

<CONTACT>Lisa A. Algarin
<DESC>This special notice is posted in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2, Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions.  The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Safety Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), Acquisition Management Division, intends to issue purchase orders on a sole source basis, on behalf of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), to holders of mineral permits on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) to cover the cost of reproduction services associated with Geological and Geophysical (G&G) Data and Information. The mineral permits are granted under the authority of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act.  The Act, at 30 CFR 551.11 and 551.12, requires permittees to provide the Department of the Interior access to and copies of G&G data and information pursuant to exploration, development, and production of oil or gas.  The Act further provides that the permittees shall be reimbursed for the reasonable costs of reproducing such data and information.
This notice announces the Governments intent to purchase these services on a fixed price basis in order to establish orders for payment of these reproduction costs.  During Fiscal Year 2014, BSEE, on behalf of BOEM, intends to issue an unspecified number of these orders to the permittees as may be required by the mission of the Department of the Interior.  The orders will be issued to permittees on a sole source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 6.302-5, pursuant to the statutory requirement of the OCS Lands Act that states G&G data and information gathered by the operators must be made available to the Government, requiring the acquisition be made from a specified source.  Only the permittees can provide the G&G data and information, and the statute requires reimbursement of reproduction costs to those entities.  
This notice is intended to cover all awards made during the 12-month period beginning October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2014, with the total dollar amount of all actions estimated at a not to exceed amount of $1M.  No notices of single awards will be published. A class Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) will be executed and posted to the Bureau public webpage at http://www.bsee.gov/About-BSEE/Procurement-Business-Opportunities/JOFOC.aspx and will be reviewed on an annual basis. The applicable NAICS Code is 541360.  This is not a request for competitive quotes but a notice of intent for informational purposes only.  All potential awardees must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database (www.sam.gov) in order to receive Government acquisitions.  The point of contact for this notice is Lisa A. Algarin, Contracting Officer, BSEE, Acquisition Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS HE 2306, Herndon, VA 20170.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM)&nbsp;to negotiate on a sole source basis with CCS Content Conversion Specialists, Weidestrasse 134, 22083 Hamburg, Germany to procure docWorks&reg;, a robust, fully-developed proprietary image processing software that includes the following "out-of-the-box" capabilities: (1) supports ActiveDirectory&reg; that enables the software to work within National Library of Medicine firewalls; (2) statistics tracking and compilation that enables operator to create a variety of reports, including status of items being processed; volumes / pages digitized per time period (e.g. month); volume / batch completeness; etc.; (3) fully automated, easy to use page verification feature that allows operator to quickly determine if there are any missing pages or other missing content; (4) fully automated de-skewing and operator-friendly templating that does not require extensive manipulation to enable a volume to be processed; (5) batch processing of processed titles, including generation of the following files: compressed or uncompressed TIFF; ALTO positional markup; METS XML with page-level files sequenced in STRUCTMAP container; OCR; book-level PDF with embedded OCR; page-level JPEG2000 files; page-level JPG thumbnails; and (6) fully functional software product capable of meeting NLM's image processing requirement without additional development.<br /><br />
<p>The Library has an ongoing program to digitize historical medical print materials from its collections. Post-capture processing of images created using a digital camera or scanner plays a critical role in this effort. Having encountered numerous problems with its existing processing software, the Library has determined through market research that docWorks&reg; is the only product fully capable of making this work easier for staff to perform without undue delays resulting from vendor modification or ongoing development. The Library has identified docWorks&reg; as the only currently available, fully developed, robust image processing software that is ready to be deployed to meet its ongoing digitization needs.</p>

All responses must be submitted to the Government point of contact at the e-mail address shown below.

Keith Batchelor II, Phone Number: (301) 619-2630, E-Mail Address: roger.k.batchelor2.civ@mail.com <br>  <br> JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN  <br> FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION TO JEOL USA, INC. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br> 1.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: The contracting activity for this action is the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (MRICD).  <br>  <br> 2.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: This approval is being requested for a firm-fixed price commercial award to Jeol USA, Incorporated, 11 Dearborn Road, Peabody, MA 01960-3862. USAMRAA will issue a supply award as authorized under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) using the procedures of FAR 13.5.  Fiscal Year 2014 Research and Development funds will be used for this procurement.    <br>  <br> 3.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  USAMRICD has a requirement for the delivery of preventive maintenance and remedial repair support services for Two (2) JEOL USA, Inc. manufactured microscopes:  Electron microscope JEM-1230 and a Scanning microscope JSM-7401F currently being used for medical research.   <br>  <br> 4.	AUTHORITY CITED: This procurement is being conducted under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b). <br>  <br> 5.	REASONS FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  JEOL Inc. is the manufacturer of the JEM 1230 transmission electron microscope and the JSM-7401F field emission scanning electron microscope. JEOL field service engineers are factory trained and therefore uniquely qualified to repair and maintain the highly complex, multiple, and in some cases proprietary systems that comprise these state of the art instruments. Repairs will be completed using components and repair parts manufactured specifically for JEOL microscopes to ensure that the instruments are maintained to factory specifications.  In addition, JEOL's first priority when scheduling for contract holders ensures that highly sensitive components that degrade with extended loss of vacuum and/or cooling be conserved, reducing down time and impact to the mission. <br>  <br> 6.	EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: Not applicable.  No competition will be obtained as JEOL USA, Inc. is the only source that can satisfy the Government's requirement. <br>  <br> 7.	ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:  It is the policy of USAMRAA to promote the use of competitive procedures whenever and wherever possible. Market research with future procurements of this nature will include a search for competitive suppliers that can provide specific products that can meet the Government's minimum requirement.  <br>  <br> 8.	MARKET RESEARCH: Field service engineers employed by JEOL Inc. are uniquely trained and qualified to service and maintain the electron microscopes to factory specifications using manufacture replacement parts and components. This knowledge base and experience cannot be duplicated by other vendors. Market research for alternatives continues. Technical personnel conducted web searches and reviewed vendor specifications for this requirement. Since this research is on-going, other potential vendors were cost prohibitive and would require substantial duplication of effort.   <br>  <br> 9.	INTERESTED SOURCES:  <br>  <br> OTHER FACTS:  An $80,000.00 trade-in value for these instruments has been quoted by JEOL Inc. in a purchase contract awarded for two new electron microscopes. The trade in value is contingent upon the instruments remaining under service contract with JEOL until they are uninstalled. For the current contract award, a solicitation was posted on FEDBIZOPPS on  <br> 23 January 2012 with no competition received.  The solicitation was competed on FEDBIZOPPS in unrestricted manner.  The resulting contract was W81XWH-12-P-0150 which included a base twelve-month base year and one twelve-month option year.  No other known sources have demonstrated an ability to provide the required services to date. <br>

Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. <br />(f) Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov . <br /><br />SECURITY CLEARANCE:</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver.

<DESC>This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
 The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

POSITION TITLE: USPSC Senior Democracy Specialist <br />5. MARKET VALUE: $84,697-$110,104 per annum (GS-14 equivalent) with 25% Post Differential (currently) <br />6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two years <br />7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/Kyrgyz Republic, Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic<br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />A) BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Kyrgyz Republic is a small, landlocked and mountainous country of Central Asia with a population of just over 5.5 million people. It is the second-poorest country in Central Asia, with one-third of the population living below the poverty line. In the aftermath of the April 2010 violent change in government and the ethnic conflict in the south of the country in June 2010, the Kyrgyz Republic is emerging from a deep political and economic crisis. Significantly, the Kyrgyz Republic was also the first Central Asian state to experience a peaceful and democratic transition of presidential power in 2011. The success of its citizens in building a prosperous, democratic country could have important implications for all of Central Asia.</p>
<p>Despite the country's progress, impediments to development remain, including widespread corruption, low foreign investment, and a high unemployment rate. Approximately one-third of the Kyrgyz Republic's workforce is employed abroad, reducing the available pool of qualified labor. The implementation of democratic and key economic policy reforms remains a challenge, and limited energy resources and low agricultural productivity contribute to insufficient economic growth.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the country is moving towards a more stable and representative democratic government that could be a regional model. In collaboration with the Government and people of the Kyrgyz Republic, USAID assistance has helped the country achieve substantial progress in the areas of economic growth, democratic governance, health care reform, improvement of basic education and agricultural development.</p>
<p>Kyrgyzstan's success or failure in its efforts to achieve successful democratic transition will have long-term ramifications for how democracy is viewed in this country and the broader region. Because it serves as a potential model for democracy in the region, and because of its proximity to South Asia and its potential to contribute to stability in nearby Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Kyrgyz Republic is of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.</p>
<p>USAID has been active in the Kyrgyz Republic since 1992 when it established a USAID Country Office which was managed by USAID's Regional Mission in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Following the political crisis in 2010, and in recognition of the Kyrgyz Republic's importance to US foreign policy goals as well as the key role the country plays in serving as a model for democratic development in the region, USAID elevated the status of the USAID/Kyrgyz Republic Office to a full USAID Mission in summer 2013. Currently, the USAID/Kyrgyz Republic Mission is USAID's newest Mission headquartered in Bishkek with a sub-office in Osh, Kyrgyz Republic.</p>
<p>USAID/Kyrgyz Republic (USAID/KR) is responsible for managing a development program of over $50 million, of which approximately $25 million are dedicated to economic development activities spread across several sub-sectors: macro-economic policy, trade and investment, private sector development, agriculture, and clean energy. In addition to the Mission Director, the Mission is staffed with three direct hires, five U.S. Personal Service Contractors (USPSCs), and 17 Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs).</p>
<p>USAID/KR is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals to manage a complex portfolio of flexible programs designed to assist the continuing transition to a peaceful society with a capable system of governance in the Kyrgyz Republic. USAID/KR works with Kyrgyz government partners, and local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) supporting the development of the private sector, agriculture, basic and higher education, improved healthcare, rule of law, protecting human rights, combating corruption, strengthening political competition and civil society, the media, and enhancing the quality of governance. The mission is also responsible for management of conflict reduction programs.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p>Past performance shall be viewed as a responsibility determination. In the event two or more technically acceptable offerors bid an identical total price, the Contracting Officer may evaluate responsibility of the contractor by seeking relevant performance information through sources such AMMIS inventory system at the Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center and records posted on Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Retrieval System (PPRS), or other government data bases and other sources that are available.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span>https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></a><span> on the issue date of 02/04/13. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved source is: Ontic Engineering (45934). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.

(b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

<DESC>This amendment revises the Pre-Solicitation notice. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes to the pre-solicitation are underlined.<br /><br /></span><br />National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Vaccine Branch Flow Cytometry Core, plans to procure on a sole source basis the MoFlo Astrios w/intellisort II from Beckman Coulter, 11800 SW 147th Ave, Miami, FL 33196.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-line-break-override: none"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501- (a)(1)&nbsp; using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions</span>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>Delivery Date: 90 days from date of award.</p>
<p>The NCI CCR, Vaccine Branch Flow Cytometry Core was created in Bldg 41 to fulfill an urgent, unmet need on NCI's Bethesda campus for a Core with BL2/BL3 containment, able to safely sort live cells infected with retroviruses, such as HIV/SIV, and other infectious agents known or suspected in blood and tissue samples. The VB Flow Cytometry Core also supports multiple flow cytometry applications including: cell sorting of both infectious samples (HIV, SIV, HTLV) and non-infectious samples, multi-color immunophenotyping, cell cycle analysis, proliferation analysis (Ki67, PCNA, BrdU, CFSE), apoptosis measurement (Annexin V, JC1, Active Caspase 3, TUNEL), intracellular cytokine analysis, stem cell analysis and sorting, calcium flux analysis, bead array analysis of soluble proteins, phosphorylated protein analysis, fluorescent protein analysis and sorting, side population cell sorting and quantitative flow cytometry. The VB Flow Cytometry Core currently supports CCR investigators from 13branches including the Vaccine Branch, the Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, and the Cancer Genetics Branch.</p>
<p>The VB Flow Cytometry Core is currently equipped with one FACSAria II cell sorter. The FACSAria II is configured with 488 nm, 640 nm, and 405 nm lasers and 12-color capability for cell sorting. This laser configuration does not allow for cell sorting of samples utilizing the fluorescent fruit proteins (such as mCherry) that have become popular with CCR investigators due to the ability to use this label in assays along with other commonly used labels but can only be sorted on Flow Cytometry Core cell sorters in Building 37. There is an urgent and compelling need for another Core cell sorter in Building 41 with the 561 nm laser needed for this type of cell sorting.</p>
<p>The VB Flow Cytometry Core has been approved by CCR to purchase of a new cell sorter using Resource Request System funds. VB hopes to use the instrument to identify novel subsets of submicron biological particles, 1) for use as diagnostic biomarkers of disease and treatment responses, and 2) to discover characteristics of those particles that will enable the development of new therapies (vaccines or other targeted therapies) for cancers, immune disorders, and infections diseases. This cell sorter needs to be equipped with 488 nm, 561nm, 640nm and 405nm lasers, 18 color capability, index sorting into 96-well plates, and a biological safety cabinet for infectious single cell sorting, because several users in the Vaccine Branch will use the instrument for human and non-human primate infectious specimens.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting cell sorting of infectious cells and samples expressing fluorescent proteins, this cell sorter needs to support the new <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nanoFACS<sup>TM</sup></span> application currently being developed at NCI. The Beckman Coulter <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moflow Astrios w/Intellisort </span>II is the only commercially available cell sorter with the sensitivity needed to detect and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sort nanoscale</span> particles in the 80-100 nm ranged, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with two independent FSC channels with multiple mask selection capabilities, and with zero dead electronic time required for practical implementation of the nanoFACSTM application.</span> <br /><br /><br />Contractor Requirements are:</p>
<p>The cell sorter to be purchased for the Vaccine Branch Flow Cytometry Core Facility must also meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Dual multi-fiber Beam Shaping Optic (BSO) for fiber coupled lasers (reduces footprint, improves beam characteristics, and simplifies alignment) <br />&bull; Supports two independent FSC channels, FSC-1 and FSC-2 with multiple mask selection for application-specific setup <br />&bull; FSC PMTs provide adjustable voltages down to 100V <br />&bull; Voltage &amp; gain settings stored in software protocols and FCS files and displayed in a new Mini-Pod view on the instrument control panel <br />&bull; Minimum threshold trigger of 0.001% <br />&bull; Define and use custom filters fully integrated with the standard filters <br />&bull; Automatically store filter setup in an FCS file for retrieval and application between Astrios Instruments <br />&bull; Display and print instrument filter setup as part of the Run Report extracted from an FCS file <br />&bull; QC criteria and results for each detector available for each POD display <br />&bull; New mini-POD displays two-channel Forward Scatter (FSC) optical path, which supports all of the above features <br />&bull; Selectable factory-masks allow user to adjust small and large particle sensitivity <br />&bull; Seven (7) laser alignment through only two (2) alignment stages for quick sorter setup <br />&bull; Flat-Top beam profile on fiber coupled lasers increases beam stability and power, alignment ease <br />&bull; Touch Screen Control Panel for instrument set up and sort monitoring (intuitive operation and cross-training) <br />&bull; Auto Start Up enables lasers to automatically turn on and fluidics to pressurize (time savings) <br />&bull; Bead-less drop delay determination and monitoring (fewer foreign particles in the fluid line that carries the sample) <br />&bull; Single button Auto QC with enhanced troubleshooting guidance <br />&bull; Sort chamber free of hard edges designed for aerosol containment and cleanability <br />&bull; Aerosol Evacuation System (AES) pulling particulates from three (3) chambers with verified performance to meet the ISAC guidelines <br />&bull; SmartSampler sample tube input from 0.5ml to 50ml with optional temperature control (largest sample input range) <br />&bull; Quick Release nozzle design for easy access to nozzle tip <br />&bull; Electronic capability to simultaneously detect 32 parameters (32 bit processing and 100 MHz sampling speeds); Zero electronic dead time equates to no hard aborts. <br />&bull; Only sorter capable of &gt;70,000 sort decisions/second validated performance <br />&bull; &gt;100,000 acquisition rate/second validated performance <br />&bull; Mixed Mode sorting: only sorter where each sort stream is capable of having its own sort mode (Enrich, Purify, Single) programmed.

<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 11 AM EST, on December 24, 2013. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed to<br />240-276-5399 or emailed to Reyes Rodriguez, Contracting Specialist via electronic mail at reyes.rodriguez@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through sam.gov.

Test Instrumentation, Enterprise, Development and Support (TIEDS) is geared towards the full spectrum of the instrumentation requirement, research, development, production, integration, and sustainment processes.  TIEDS is expected to allow PM ITTS IMO to respond to evolving technology and military demands.  The spectrum of services required range from requirements analysis and concept exploration to rapid prototyping, system development, system sustainment and other related tasks.      <br>        <br>    The Government anticipates a Single Award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract vehicle to be awarded.  The Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure for the task orders will be structured appropriately to the level of effort to be performed.  CLINs may be Firm Fixed Price, Time and Materials, or Cost Plus Fixed Fee.      <br>        <br>    Attached are the Draft Solicitation documents for TIEDS.  The office (SFAE-STRI-KOT) is seeking questions, comments, and/or suggestions with regard to the draft documents.    <br>        <br>    The anticipated Procurement Acquisition Lead Time (PALT) milestones are as follows:    <br>        <br>    Anticipated Event Approximate Dates:    <br>        <br>    Release of TIEDS Draft Solicitation: 30 October 2013    <br>    Deadline for submission of Questions to Draft Solicitation: 13 November 2013    <br>    Deadline for submission of Questions to Draft Solicitation Amendment: 29 November 2013    <br>    Release of TIEDS Final Solicitation: 2 January 2014    <br>    Proposal Submission: 9 February 2014    <br>    Target Award Date: September 2014    <br>        <br>    All correspondence shall be submitted via e-mail to Jason.R.Malak.civ@mail.mil using the attached Question and Comment form (Attachment 3) no later than 1500 Eastern Time by the deadline submissions identified above.      <br>        <br>    Questions and Answers, as well as any changes to draft documents will be posted to provide industry updated TIEDS information as an Amendment to the Draft Solicitation.    <br>        <br>    Proposal preparation time is anticipated to be 30 days.    <br>        <br>    Draft documents are subject to change.

<DESC>Security cooperation (SC) is defined by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the means by which the DoD encourages and enables countries and organizations to work with the United States to achieve strategic objectives. The SC operations of all DoD organizations support the objectives outlined in the National Security Strategy of the United States, the National Defense Strategy, and the National Military Strategy. SC objectives are carried out as a part of the theater strategy planning and execution function of multiple DoD agencies. Currently, each DoD Agency has an individual method by which theater security cooperation (TSC) data is collected and accessed. The G-TSCMIS effort will make global TSC data more accessible to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the Joint Staff, as well as available to the TSC community at large. The G- TSCMIS will entail the standardization of TSC data, single point aggregation and visualization of that data, and data linkages to enable assessment of the data against strategic objectives of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff.
*Note:  This posting is an update to the RFI issued on 10/25/13 - https://e-commerce.sscno.nmci.navy.mil/command/02/acq/navhome.nsf/homepa ge?readform

****18 December 2013 UPDATE**** The RFI response due date is extended from 12/18/13 to 1/9/14. All other portions of the RFI remain unchanged.

<DESC>Work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division (SWD)consisting of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the primary responsible agent for the Corps of Engineers via established agreements. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed the geographical area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.   If capacity is used outside the SWD geographic boundaries for other than the Division's nationwide customers, prior MSC coordination will be made or capacity will be granted to the appropriate geographic District. <br>  <br> WHEN SOLICITED, IT WILL BE ISSUED UNDER RFP NUMBER: W9126G-13-R-0089 <br>  <br> Pre-solicitation Synopsis Notice HUBZone Small Business Request for Proposal (RFP) for Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Construction Services for the United States Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) in Southwestern Division (SWD) and its surrounding areas consisting of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. <br>  <br> The Contract Specialist point of contact for this anticipated solicitation will be Mrs. Ashley Morgan at 817-886-1022, e-mail ashley.morgan@usace.army.mil  <br>  <br> FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This Synopsis is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming.

The maximum combination of orders is $30,000,000. The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.

In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal. The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.

There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition. Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded. If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un- awarded capacity.

<DESC>&nbsp;REVISED Synopsis of the proposed maintenance dredging of Great Kills Harbor, New York, Federal Navigation Project
<p><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District (USACE) proposes to perform maintenance dredging of the Federal Navigation Channel of Great Kills Harbor, with subsequent placement of the dredged material at the Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS). The proposed maintenance dredging is expected to involve the removal of approximately 252,000 Cubic Yards of sand to a depth of 10 feet below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 2 feet allowable overdepth. The proposed work is recommended to be performed by a mechanical dredge having a clamshell bucket or similar plant. It is not recommended that this work be performed by a hopper dredge since a majority of the sand in the proposed dredging footprint is above the Mean High Water (MHW) line. Additionally, multiple barges and tug boats may be needed to perform the work during dredging, transport, and placement of the dredged material.<br /><br />The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of his receipt of the notice to proceed. The contractor will be required to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the basic work ready for use not later than ninety-four (94) calendar days after the receipt by him of the notice to proceed for the basic work. The contractor is required to maintain an integrated production of at least 3,000 cubic yards per calendar day.</p>
<p>The work is estimated to cost between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. Amended plans and specifications for the subject project would be available on/about 23 December 2013 with bid opening on/about 23 January 2014. It is the intention of the Government to award in February 2014 and issue the Notice to Proceed on / about 20 February 2014. The applicable SIC code is 1629 and NAICS code is 237990 and the small business size standard is $20.0 million. <br /><br />This is an unrestricted Procurement</p>
Large business concerns must submit as part of their bid a subcontracting plan for this project in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-8 and FAR Clause 52.219-9. Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan may make the bidder ineligible for award of the contract. Small Business Goals: If a large business, the prime contractor shall provide its small business subcontracting plan conforming to the requirements of FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.7. The small business subcontracting goals for USACE New York District are as follows: Small Business 50.0%, Small Disadvantaged Business 17.0%, Women-Owned Small Business 18.0%, HubZone Small Business 10.0%, Veteran Owned Small Business 4.0% and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 4.0%. A subcontracting plan reflecting goals less than indicated, shall provide, as part of the subcontracting plan submission, those extenuating circumstances of why the goal cannot be met. You may contact the District, Deputy of Small Business or your local SBA for assistance. A contract will not be awarded until the Contracting Officer has determined that the subcontracting plan provides maximum practicable opportunities for Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HubZone Small Business and Women-Owned Small Business program concerns to participate in contract performance. The media selected for issuance of Synopsis/Solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the internet.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking interested bidders for a construction project entitled: Lower Granite Juvenile Fish Collection Channel Reservoir Side Fish Slot Lower Concrete Plugs. The construction will occur at the Lower Granite Dam in Garfield County, near Pomeroy, Washington. This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract. Construction magnitude is estimated between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000, and 100% performance and payment bonds will be required. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $33,500,000. <br /><br />This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify small businesses with the interest in and capability to accomplish the work. This is not a solicitation. <br /><br />1) A capability statement expressing interest in this requirement, describing your company and its capability to complete a project of this scope, magnitude and complexity. Include a statement detailing any special qualifications and certifications, applicable to the scope of this project, held by your firm and/or in-house personnel. Include a list of projects with descriptions that are similar in nature. <br />2) A statement of your firm's bonding capacity. <br />3) A statement of your firm's business size and type. <br /><br />Submit this information to Jani Long, Contract Specialist, via email to jani.c.long@usace.army.mil. <br />Your response to this notice must be received on or before 2:00PM on December 18, 2013. <br /><br />Summary of Scope of Work: <br /><br />Permanent closure of the reservoir side fish slots use the existing fish screen structures and are converted into fish slot plugs. The screens are removed from the slot by the Corps using their existing lifting beam and crane. Once the screens are out of the slot, they are turned over to the Contractor, the existing screen legs are strengthened, the pervious areas of the screens are lined, and the screen is filled with concrete and reinforcing to create a solid plug. About 378 cy of concrete fill is required for the 18 plugs. <br /><br />The new concrete is extended above the top of the existing screen framework to facilitate sealing to the side walls of each slot. New lifting hardware is incorporated into the concrete fill, and reinsertion into the slot is accomplished by the Contractor with a Contractor furnished crane. <br /><br />After the screen plug has been lowered into the slot, divers are deployed in the slot to the top of the screen plug. The lifting line is released by the divers and backer rod sealing material is placed in the gap between the plug and the walls of the slot. The backer rod material is pushed down about 6 inches from the top of the slot plug all around the perimeter. After the backer rod material is in place, the divers place a cementitious grout into the slot all around up to the top of the plug. Once the grout has been placed and has hardened, reinforcing steel is installed into the threaded couplers on the top of the slot plug. The side walls of the slot are pressure washed to remove any biological growth or film in preparation for placing a minimum of 5 feet of tremie concrete on top of the plug. About 324 cy of tremie concrete fill is required for the 18 slots. <br /><br />Permanent closure of the Wagner Horn slots uses a precast insert with an integral bottom form grouted into the bottom of the Wagner Horn slot. About 54 cy of concrete fill is required for the 18 slots (54 wagner horn openings). A roughly 6-foot tall, 30-inch diameter, precast plug of concrete with integrated reinforcing, bottom form, and grout injection ports is anticipated for this closure. The existing Wagner Horn screen will be lowered from deck level using the cables that currently attach the screen to the dam. After the screen is removed, a new high strength cable and sheave will be pulled down into the slot conduits using the existing screen attachment cable. <br /><br />Divers will remove the original screen and cable assembly, pressure wash the corrugated inside walls of the conduit, and attach the precast plug to the sheave. The new cable will then be used to pull the precast plug into the Wagner Horn conduit and seat the integrated form against the roof of the intake tube. The divers will then connect to one or more of the grout injection ports provided on the form and fill the annular space between precast plug and the existing interior conduit walls. Once the grout has sufficiently hardened, the injection ports can be removed from the forms and the area ground smooth by divers while the new cable is retracted from the abandoned sheave. <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is July 2014 - March 2015.

The authority permitting the environment is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implement by FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Award is for a Bridge Modification to bridge the gap between the expiration of the predecessor contract and placement of a follow-on contract. The estimated award date of the follow-on is FY 2014. The award was made to the incumbent contractor Four Seasons Environmental, Inc., that has performed the same services over the past years. The acquisition is to provide uninterrupted contractor support services to meet the operational mission of South Atlantic Area Research Facilities (SAARF). Services shall be for a Six (6) month period for a Firm Fixed Price modification for extension of services, with a small IDIQ component for facilities operations, maintenance and administrative support services at the SAARF in Georgia and Florida. The Contractor is required to provide services to maintain the facility in full support of the research mission. This bridge modification will allow enough time for the long term follow-on effort for the Operations and Maintenance Services requirement to be competed. By not awarding a bridge modification extension it would adversely impact the mission of the SAARF (In accordance with FAR 6.302(a)(2)). </span></p>

Two locations Richard B. Russell Agricultural Research Center (RRC) and Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory (SEPL) are located adjacent to the University of Georgia and are adjoining. The Fort Pierce Location includes US Horticultural Research Laboratory (USHRL) and Picos Research Farm. Mission: Ensure and improving safety of food and feed, improving quality and economic value of food, research emerging poultry borne diseases and food borne pathogens of people. Research on citrus, vegetables, and ornamentals. To that end, it is vital to the research mission of the SAARF that the incumbent continue to provide O&amp;M support.</span></p>

No other offeror could immediately perform all of the required services within the necessary time frame and period of performance of six (6) months is a sufficient timeframe in which to transition a new contractor. Therefore, Four Seasons Environmental is uniquely qualified as the incumbent contractor to provide continuity of services to ARS. This notice is not a request for competitive bids, rather public notice as required to allow for a competitive follow-on Contract for the aforementioned service.</span></p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br>  <br> 	HQ Army Materiel Command	 <br> 	Office of Command Counsel <br> 	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 <br> 	Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-5527 <br> 	Facsimile number:  (703) 806-8866 or 8875 <br>  <br> 	Packages sent by FedEx, UPS, or other delivery service should be addressed to: <br> 	HQ Army Materiel Command <br> 	Office of Command Counsel <br> 	Room2-1SE3401 <br> 	1412 Jackson Loop <br> 	Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-5527 <br>  <br> The AMC-level protest procedures are located on the Internet.  If Internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-level protest procedures. <br> 	http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp
